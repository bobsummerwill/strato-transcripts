# TODO: Add whisperx-server once a distributable package/URL is available

# PyTorch and pyannote versions - installed by shell script (install_packages_and_venv.sh)
# WhisperX 3.7.6 requires torch~=2.8.0 and pyannote-audio<4.0.0, but we need:
#   - torch 2.9.1+cu130 for RTX 5070 Blackwell / CUDA 13.0 support
#   - pyannote-audio 4.0.1 (last version without torch==2.8.0 pin)
#   - torchaudio 2.9.1+cu130
# The shell script handles these version conflicts by:
#   1. Installing WhisperX (pulls torch 2.8.0)
#   2. Upgrading to torch 2.9.1+cu130 with --force-reinstall
#   3. Installing pyannote-audio 4.0.1
#   4. Applying compatibility patches for PyTorch 2.6+ and torchaudio 2.9.x
#
# DO NOT UNCOMMENT - managed by install_packages_and_venv.sh:
# torch==2.9.1+cu130
# torchaudio==2.9.1+cu130
# pyannote-audio==4.0.1
