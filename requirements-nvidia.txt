# ==============================================================================
# PyTorch Nightly with CUDA 12.8 - For NVIDIA GPUs (including RTX 5070)
# ==============================================================================
#
# WHY NIGHTLY:
# - REQUIRED for RTX 5070 Blackwell architecture (sm_120 compute capability)
# - Stable PyTorch 2.5.1 only supports up to sm_90 (Hopper/Ada)
# - Nightly builds include latest GPU support and bug fixes
#
# WHY CUDA 12.8:
# - Latest stable CUDA version with broad GPU support
# - More compatible than CUDA 13.0 which is still experimental
# - Works with all NVIDIA drivers 535+
#
# WHEN TO SWITCH TO STABLE:
# - Once PyTorch 2.6+ stable is released with Blackwell support  
# - Expected: Q1-Q2 2026
