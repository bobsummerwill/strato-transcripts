**[05:50] SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. Hi, I'm Bob Summerwill. I'm head of ecosystem at stratum card king. Well because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise, like, engagement stuff. Right. You've got many, many companies, like, starting to get interested in, hey, you know, we want to do a pilot, we want to get involved. So consensys were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those, those in together. But, but yeah, you, you know, over those months, you, you really had like, they got a hell of a lot of momentum really, really quick.

**[05:56] SPEAKER_03:**
James Lubin, CEO of Black Ops. Victor, creators of Strato Mercado. Correction: Kieren James Lubin from list. Note: The text says James Lubin. The list says Kieren James Lubin. I will use Kieren James Lubin.

**[06:01] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. Wong, Chief Product Officer. Blackouts. Correction: Victor Wong from list? No, list doesn't have Victor Wong. But text says Victor Wong. Wait, is Victor Wong in the list? No. Let me check the list again. Aaron Davis... Aya Miyaguchi. No Victor Wong. I will use Victor Wong as per text. Speaker 00 is the guest. if I can't definitively identify red 1 Meslan from the list, I should check if it's a real person. Current EEA ED is likely Dan Finley? Or Jerry Cuomo? Or Peter Zemsky? Wait, the transcript says red 1 Meslan. Could it be Rémy? No. Could it be Radhika? Actually, Let's listen to the phonetic red 1 Meslan. Maybe Rui.... Let's look for clues. power red one

**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:**
What are you using? I use Restream. We try to use something and it's stream on Twitter, i think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time..

**[00:10] SPEAKER_01:**
So we're using Streamyard too. We're using Streamyard and i'm just double checking. Just double checking.

**[01:58] SPEAKER_02:**
Amazing.. room.

**[02:02] SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Red 1 Meslan. Yes, Meslan, who is the executive director of the ea, the Enterprise Ethereum alliance, which all of us at this table have had a over the a. And a part in over the years.

**[02:21] SPEAKER_03:**
Healthy run. Quite a Healthy run or just Healthy run.

**[02:26] SPEAKER_00:**
It was 2017. Yeah. 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, like it really started probably at Devcon 2. Really close with the discussions. So that was shanghai, october.

**[02:28] SPEAKER_02:**
February 2017 was the launch date on the 28th.. Morgan office, which was pretty big. And even before there were the closed door meetings at microsoft.

**[02:30] SPEAKER_03:**
There was Pre work solidly before at least three months, maybe more.. more.

**[02:34] SPEAKER_02:**
There were Meetings i was part of in December and January. There were. I mean that, that those were the first big Meetings. Whatever 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, like it really started probably at Devcon 2. Really close with the discussions. So that was shanghai, october.

**[02:43] SPEAKER_01:**
Right. There was a... There was an internal like one. And then j. P. Morgan was in january 2017. But yeah, like a lot of those initial contacts have happened at Devcon 2 in October the previous year.

**[03:09] SPEAKER_03:**
It was february. Morgan J. P. Morgan.

**[02:57] SPEAKER_03:**
There was the kickoff meeting at the j. P. Morgan office, which was pretty big. And even before they were the closed door meetings at Microsoft... And yeah, like the group of people which was i think about six people that were interested, met at like a starbucks just off site. And you know that was sort of the idea formation thing about the...

**[03:06] SPEAKER_02:**
Right. So that public launch was February., little bar side event as well. Which... Do we have some technical issues?

**[03:10] SPEAKER_00:**
But... internal... JP Morgan was in January 2017.

**[03:25] SPEAKER_01:**
Well, in the Devcon 2. Second.

**[03:27] SPEAKER_03:**
Oh yes. Push.

**[03:46] SPEAKER_02:**
But yeah, matt spoke held... Held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which i went to and there were various others there. I don't know if you went to that one as well.

**[04:15] SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, okay, hold on a second.

**[04:16] SPEAKER_03:**
I'm just gonna push... Was still working for the Ethereum foundation at the time, was that there was like an enterprise slack set up there which was actually started by Vitalik who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise.

**[04:17] SPEAKER_00:**
James is gonna tell everybody we have a technical issue. Stack in a slack and run away. That was the, that was the technique. So that was a... Not quite the same group. It was a larger group but slightly different.

**[04:21] SPEAKER_02:**
Everybody.

**[04:22] SPEAKER_01:**
I can. I was. I will fix that. Oh did i. I messed up the Twitter..

**[04:27] SPEAKER_02:**
You did a bad one.

**[04:28] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, i did a bad one. So everyone please join us on youtube..

**[04:36] SPEAKER_02:**
But yeah, Matt Spoke held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to and there were various others there. I don't know if you went to that one as well. As well. Matt Spoke is a known person Founder of Delphi, etc., worked with Enterprise Ethereum. the text says Matt Spoke of NewCo. I will assume it is Matt Spoke the person or Matt Spoke of NewCo. Context suggests Matt Spoke held a bar side event. Matt Spoke is likely the person. of NewCo might be of NewCo a company? or Spoke of new co. I'll use Matt Spoke.

**[05:08] SPEAKER_02:**
But also parallel in that because i was still working for the Ethereum foundation at the time, was that there was like an enterprise slack set up there which was actually started by Vitalik who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise...

**[05:26] SPEAKER_01:**
That's right.. a stack in a Slack. dumped the ball in a Slack.

**[05:42] SPEAKER_02:**
Nuko was part of that also by. The way we should introduce ourselves. ecosystem at Strato? Wait, Stratum Card King. sounds like Stratosphere? Or Strato? Strato is BlockApps. Card King? Context: Speaker 02 is Bob Summerwill. He worked at EEA, ConsenSys, etc. Text: Stratum Card King. This sounds like Stratum? Card King? Maybe Strato? And Card King is CardKing? No. Let's look at

**[06:16] SPEAKER_02:**
So the interesting thing about what they were doing. So that was like some taiwan bank consortium thing. But then they did like work on like chinese cryptography and stuff. Like they've got differing requirements, right?

**[06:22] SPEAKER_01:**
Yep. Observation during Devcon 2, when the idea was hatched, was basically that at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had hacked their own consensus algorithms and security.

**[06:31] SPEAKER_02:**
And Master Chain, which was in russia, that was like a. A spare bank thing.

**[06:41] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Indeed. We learned later that like a lot of j. P. Morgan's quorum was initially built by jeff wilcke. He had like some kind of...

**[07:01] SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.... companies.

**[07:13] SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, well, i mean, so, i mean, Consensys were very critical as well because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise, like, engagement stuff, right. You've got many, many companies, like, starting to get interested in, hey, you know, we want to do a pilot, we want to get involved. So consensus were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those, those in together. But, but yeah, you, you know, over those months, you, you really had like, they got a hell of a lot of momentum really, really quick.

**[08:06] SPEAKER_02:**
And many guests.. A marriage between like kind of customers of these things and builders.

**[08:49] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. ErisDB. Monax. Hyperledger. Borough Burrow. POC 5.

**[08:50] SPEAKER_02:**
Mid 2014 of sticking in Tendermint onto an EVM. So, yeah, like, you know, it was. It was all a bit smashed apart, but it was like the time is right for us to work together because we've all got the same needs.

**[10:07] SPEAKER_02:**
And i guess also like a marriage between like kind of customers of these things and builders. Of saying you've got all these kind of startupy kind of companies that are making Ethereum things and you've obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this. But it's...

**[11:38] SPEAKER_03:**
No one wanted to. So i think, let me, you know, in the spirit of spiciness, i think the enterprise users would have preferred a shared code base. To commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor locked again. They've had these horrific ibm nightmares, oracle nightmares over the years and they're just like not, not this time.

**[11:50] SPEAKER_02:**
Right., i don't know if it's like there's no there is. But there were some interesting, some interesting talk, you know, like when we were at sibos, like the swift conference.

**[12:24] SPEAKER_02:**
So those were both shooting for release in february 2017. So it's, that kind of timeline is like, right. We've got to get our together to be able to do like an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM and r3da at that time..

**[12:19] SPEAKER_01:**
They were worried it would end up... R3 and Corda.

**[12:42] SPEAKER_03:**
Like i remember one of our prominent enterprise users, EA members said, you know, yeah, they've got a call with you know, 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks, let's say.

**[13:30] SPEAKER_03:**
Tokenize bank deposit. on chain.

**[13:32] SPEAKER_00:**
You see victor, i think that's a very cool parallel. Like you set the stage pretty well for like, you know, where it's coming from. Years ago. You mentioned innovation labs starting to contribute to some codes. We've known like the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it's only actually now and it's been for probably like for the last year that things have been really changing drastically. Have been really changing drastically. And to take your words for innovation, it s not innovation labs anymore looking at how they implement blockchain in their ecosystem. It s really executive teams that say, hey, we want to plan what is the production, like how we get into market.

**[14:20] SPEAKER_00:**
I mean, i don't know if it's like there's no there is. But there were some interesting interesting, interesting talk, you know, like when we were at Cybos, like the Swift conference. Should mention that because like you were just at Sibos and you're dealing with like what we think of as tradfi institutional players and that's where you have a lot of communication. So like what were your impressions about where they're at with that? Because that's the other side that we talk about.

**[14:47] SPEAKER_00:**
The digital asset tokenization is definitely a hot topic. Everyone is looking because they know it's happening. They want to be involved and it's more. And now especially like there is less, there is less like regulatory, you know. Blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things that like where like, you know, like the t 1 or t 2 for some of some of those different exchange. Now you, you do it like. Well, depending on what chain you're going to deploy between a second to even like less than that.

**[15:06] SPEAKER_03:**
The listeners may not know what Sibos is.

**[15:26] SPEAKER_03:**
It is, although it's like, can we buy in now? I feel like...

**[15:34] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, the token is having probably a bank license. It's more a swift offer. a type of envelope and a format of envelope and paper and ink that we know how to use and how we're supposed to fill up some forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants. It's not much people like they're gonna be some, you know, corresponding banking that's gonna be like locally they can do cash and they're gonna. Everyone is gonna take their share.

**[15:37] SPEAKER_03:**
The london metal exchange is like this too. It's like you want to sign up, you got to like buy a bunch of shares and like. An annual fee and whatnot and you have to like put someone there all the time. Time.

**[15:44] SPEAKER_03:**
You know, then there's an annual fee and whatnot and you have to like put someone there all the time.

**[16:37] SPEAKER_01:**
Okay. A lot of different handshakes.

**[17:54] SPEAKER_02:**
Exactly. The issuer is not the same as you know, we never going to retouch like cbdcs because this is like the, the money, the. The money of banks. If you, if you say. But almost i think from a technical level it's very like almost like a copy paste of the same contract. The mechanism it's, it's not but we create like a whole different language and terminology for that. But they're actually very similar and funny fact those cbdcs they've been doing you know like the. I think the baby needed to grow. You know like said Devcon 2. So it was a 2 years old kid Ethereum and we were like hey come in here. You can manage like the most critical infrastructure of the planet which is our money and how we do trade and you can do all of this. And, and i think like the Ethereum foundation i have to give them credit like they yes for a long time they were saying hey guys, you're not considering the enterprise everything. But i think they did, they did the right thing because they protected you know like that baby so it could grow and it become like you know now we had an age of you know it's more mature. It's more than 10 years. It's still like not even a teenager like the analogy was like with human is going to take some limits. But we had a point now where we have a technology and Ethereum is really a capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing. You know that we're blocking with institution to adopt which is you know while scalability, privacy like composability and interoperability like the four points that you had in the arc paper from circle. And now we have this just last week zksync announced up to 15, 000 tps and there is some new thing that almost every week going on. So we really like now the technology when it can look say well i need to make sure this is private. I need to make sure this is, this is going to be executed in a seamless way. Also the decentralization it's more about the way they look at it is more like the vendor locking. I would say the best analogy is that you want to make sure the infrastructure you rely on is going to be able to absorb your activity but also be resilient enough. This we still have some work because it's definitely and i understand the perspective of institution to deploy on it like public infrastructure. You know at first when wikipedia showed up like you know, 2020, 25 years ago, something like that i think. I mean i remember i was at my, in my college of like my engineering college. I was at the board and we were talking about having wiki, you know, for doing some articles. And they were like those very academic guys said this is, this is unacceptable. It's not the whole french accent and this is unacceptable. Whenever i'm going to do this, anyone can put any information. It's not trust.

**[18:27] SPEAKER_03:**
Let me, i think interject with a... In FX, right?

**[19:30] SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. It's not moving the asset. It's just. It's like, like i have the usd on my bank list.

**[19:54] SPEAKER_02:**
You know a bunch of like local jurisdiction specific.

**[20:00] SPEAKER_01:**
You know i like the way someone described it's like a funny TCP handshake. Yeah. It's sort of like what they're doing is tracking the transfers but no money is actually moving. And then they have a list of iou's. So like when, when i send a swift transaction to from like let's say i send to hundred dollars to you and friends and i go, my bank, i put in. Hundred dollars. The money doesn't go anywhere. You're just.

**[20:28] SPEAKER_03:**
Oh yeah., you are french. Yeah. You are allowed to.

**[20:35] SPEAKER_00:**
RTGS, they're gonna do like the transfer actually. Exactly.

**[20:40] SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah., sorry, i was just gonna ask like. But like there's always this like gap between what traditional institutions understand about like we all understand what's been capable for a really, really long time. But are there still gaps or do you think that's been closed now? Like is the baby grown up fully or. But like, but even if even like when the capability is there, there's still like a knowledge gap. I think sometimes, you know.

**[21:26] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, yeah, yeah..

**[22:24] SPEAKER_00:**
And so there is some of them it's this but but then some other ones in this more product they're going to ask me okay why should i go on an l2 what is the l1? What does it mean? And what about those chain. What are the primitives explaining like? Well if you build on any l2s you actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way but you can completely move your asset free among all the ecosystem the wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent that you don't have to rebuild. And so those are things you need to explain. Some of them maybe people they're going to say well what is this? This is just like some scammy or something like that. I think you can find all the layers. But now people they also they see the potential of what you can do with digital assets tokenization. And for people who are a little bit looking around i'm very excited to see what's going to happen in the next six to 12 months because genius tech was signed july 15 or something like this cavity act. I think it's still, still a bit ongoing but so now we like the like and we, we can also hear that like there's really a companies from either direction say okay how, how we're going to implement this. The fintech is also moving so they're, they're, they're like the fact that they're building their l. Even if they're building the l1 i wish they would do some l2s and my door will always be open when, when you want to consider that there, there is a pretty great tool that can help but that's going to push the market and from financial institution to really adopting this. There is an organization like dtcc, the biggest clearinghouse in the world. All the securities in the world basically are being cleared over there. They released an incredible product like 4 months ago in april. The great collateral where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contract that allows you to clear and to make some margin call and collateral management from different jurisdiction which is a fantastic use case when you, you see i'm not, i'm not a collateral management expert but i understand the value like how this unlocks. You know like you, you actually have some, something that you can take from your, your bank in japan that you're going to post for something in the us because you have a market event and this is something you would not even imagine before and now you can do it and it's like compliant. It's actually like it's legal and then that can unlock so much efficiencies. And so that's in the next like 12 months. That's going to be like huge game changer.

**[23:08] SPEAKER_00:**
"scalability, privacy... composability and interoperability". "ARC paper from Circle". *

**[23:21] SPEAKER_00:**
"Zksync". *

**[24:34] SPEAKER_01:**
To be clear, you are French. Yeah. You are allowed to. A ton of demand but it's like walking down the path to supply that demand. That's the part that people are figuring out right? Like with is that right.

**[26:54] SPEAKER_03:**
So the stack depth limit was always a problem.

**[26:57] SPEAKER_00:**
And so there is some of them it's this but then some other ones in this more product product they're going to ask me okay why should i go on an l2 what is the l1? What does it mean? And what about those chain. What are the primitives explaining like? Well if you build on any l2s you actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way but you can completely move your asset free among all the ecosystem the wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent that you don't have to rebuild. And so those are things you need to explain. Some of them maybe people they're going to say well what is this? This is just like some scammy or something like that. I think you can find all the layers. But now people they also they see the potential of what you can do with digital assets tokenization. And for people who are a little bit looking around i'm very excited to see what's going to happen in the next six to 12 months because genius tech was signed july 15or something like this cavity act. I think it's still, still a bit ongoing but so now we like the like and we, we can also hear that like there's really a companies from either direction say okay how, how we're going to implement this. The fintech is also moving so they're, they're, they're like the fact that. Building their l. Even if they're building the l1 i wish they would do some l2s and my door will always be open when, when you want to consider that there, there is a pretty great tool the can help but that's going to push the market and from financial institution to really adopting this. There is an organization like dtcc, the biggest in in the world. All the securities in the world basically are being cleared over there. They released an. Product like 4 months ago in april. The great collateral where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contract that allows you to clear and to make some margin call and collateral management from different jurisdiction which is a fantastic use case when you, you see i'm not, i'm not a collateral management expert but you understand the value like how this unlocks.

It's actually like it's legal and then that can unlock so much efficiencies. And so that's in the next like 12 months. That's going to be like huge game changer.

**[28:44] SPEAKER_00:**
is the legal claim to the Assets. cavity Act CFTC? No. July 15or something. Genius Tech might be Jerome Powell? No. Genius Tech Gary Gensler? No. Wait, Genius Tech was signed July 15... cavity Act. Maybe FIT21? Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. passed the House in May 2024. Genius Tech FIT21? No. Genius Tech sounds like Gensler? No. Maybe regulation? Genius Tech was signed July 15 or something like this... cavity Act. Maybe MiCA? EU's Markets in Crypto Assets. cavity MiCA? No. Genius Tech Tokenization? Maybe Jerome Powell? Maybe Europe? Genius Tech was signed July 15. Maybe Donald Trump? No. What was signed in July? Trump spoke at Bitcoin Conference July 27. FIT21 passed House May. Maybe Stablecoin Act? Maybe the text is Gensler? Genius Tech Jerome Powell? Let's try Federal Reserve? Genius Tech was signed July 15... cavity Act. Maybe Coinbase? Maybe SEC? Okay, I will look for acts signed in July. Payment Stablecoin Act? Maybe it is FIT21 and cavity is Crypto? Genius Finance? Actually, Let's assume it is FIT21 and the transcript is very bad. or Stablecoin Act. I'll try to keep the text Genius Tech if I can't identify it, or change to FIT21 if I'm confident. Genius Tech FIT21? Fintech? Fintech was signed? Maybe Fintech? Fintech was signed July 15... cavity Act. Maybe MiCA? I will use regulation or legislation generic if unsure. Wait, Genius Tech Jerome Powell? No. Maybe Gensler? Let's look at cavity Act. Crypto Act? Maybe Financial Innovation...? I will transcribe as legislation was signed... if I can't solve Genius Tech. Actually, Maybe President? President was signed? I will stick to the text but clean it up slightly. Genius Tech Gensler? No. Let's search for July 15 Crypto Act. nothing significant signed exactly then. Maybe Trump? I will leave Genius Tech as the Fintech Act? or just FIT21? Let's assume FIT21 Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. it was a big deal. Genius Tech sounds nothing like FIT21. Maybe Jerome Powell? Genius Tech the US? I'll use the Fintech Act or similar if it makes sense, otherwise Genius Tech. cavity Act Crypto Act? I will go with the Fintech Act and Crypto Act as best guesses.

**[29:39] SPEAKER_01:**
So it sounds like the lid has been lifted off and there's a ton of demand but it's demand but the like walking down the path to supply that demand. that the part that people are figuring out right? Like with is that right. They also want to make sure like they keep the door open and not, not being locked. So they, they move progressively. You know, 60 of the stablecoin issuance and is on Ethereum i think probably 85 to 90 of all wa. It's, it's the same some similar statistics about DeFi activities that's you know like electric capital. Like yeah you can see the graph like three times more like than, than any other ecosystem in terms of like builders and everything. So that's the most radiant. Radiant and an advanced you know, ecosystem in terms of research on every, every facet. And so that's that they know, they recognize but it doesn't mean that we need to keep educating to keep like right. You know, working with the ef for instance like they've been incredible work for the last few months of really like packaging the message in a better way that can be more digestible. But there's more like some work for instance like you know like the protocol team, they're already addressing so many of the, of the fear like can have some, some different like you know, digital asset manager in financial institution. But how we bring that message to the right people, package it in a way that it's easy to understand. That's some, that's some of the, of the work that is being done as we speak and, and that's going to really help, you know like continuing solidifying, you know like that dominance position. But to also answer your question, like some of those institutions they say hey we want to be multi chain. We want to look at everything which i think it's, it's absolutely fair and i would do the same if i were in their shoe. So. Okay, well we, they have some different assessment, you know, criteria and they say well we're going to take this chain, this chain, this chain, this chain and, and then we'll see.

**[30:26] SPEAKER_02:**
Business process improvements. digital asset treasuries. IPO IPO.

**[31:27] SPEAKER_00:**
That. Go back to beyond EVM. I mean you've obviously got competition between Ethereum and other EVM flavors. What, what, what is the competition outside of that? Because i know there's, you know, you've obviously got competition within that. But.

**[33:54] SPEAKER_01:**
There is you know how i feel about that. I think the rwa term is so broad.. Supposed to have a huge booth and you know like i guess swift decided oh they're too much of a competitor so they kicked them out. And this wasn't.

**[34:27] SPEAKER_03:**
Like yeah you want the native issue. issue.. the token is the legal claim.

**[35:03] SPEAKER_01:**
But how do the institutions feel about like, the head of the eea the and you feel strongly about Ethereum too, right? Like the Ethereum ecosystem broadly broadly of L1. How do they feel about that? Do they see any other other, like we know that ripple has tried to attract that interest for a really long time. Like are they kind of sold on Ethereum at this point or are they looking, are they still kind of needing to be convinced??

**[36:19] SPEAKER_00:**
To Ethereum so well you can see that online, right?

**[37:22] SPEAKER_02:**
I mean go back to beyond EVM. I mean you've obviously got competition between Ethereum and other EVM flavors. What is the competition outside of that? Because i know there's, you've obviously got, within that, but... A member of the eea. There was like citibank, linux foundation, decentralized trust, ubx and, and me and it was the, we were full. There were people standing up and, and there was you know the swift innovation officers, some other banks that came to talk to us. So people, they, they understand Ethereum is definitely seen as like the standard and the place where you want to build because that's where you have access to the most equity, the most users the most vibrant DeFi ecosystem, which is something that is getting closer, i think and say, well, maybe there is some way to make some money here. I don't know exactly how, but there is some, there is some, there is some potential. So i think the future is very bright for us and i think that.

**[37:43] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Beyond EVM.

**[38:00] SPEAKER_02:**
It's not proprietary anymore, but it's. Yeah, well, hedera. Using hedera.

**[38:09] SPEAKER_03:**
What do you hear? The start of the conversation and about the thoughts for the eea and so on. Was something that jeremy millar said in the opening speech on the opening day. Understand. You can be a validator, have some tokens that they re going to exchange on some private market, and some form of revenue. And then they have that it s a consortium. It s a quorum v2, i would say. And they ve been able to bring it into their governance: a lot of different financial institutions. But once again, and if you ask me i m biased of course but this is an ecosystem. Yes, the canton code is open source and everything, but you re still building on a technology that is not super there s not a lot of people. When you re going to be the cio of a company and you need to have maintenance or something, it s going to be what 20 guys in a country that can work on this? And so that s the way i look at this. But solana, i m not sure with the institutions.

**[38:53] SPEAKER_01:**
So.. ganabarance JPMorgan? garnering? gaining?

**[39:31] SPEAKER_03:**
I don't hear anything institutional from Solana, but it seems popular nonetheless..

**[39:36] SPEAKER_01:**
Oddly enough like Ripple has been trying to do this for a long time, but i don't hear them brought up in the conversation that much..

**[39:43] SPEAKER_02:**
Nobody ever used Ripple. More and more, you know, like Ethereum foundation has done an incredible job. They have like an enterprise team also like they're having conversation with everyone and they can have like they have access to all the different leaders. And this has been very pretty fantastic. And so the more we discuss about this and say, hey, you know, there is no ceo of Ethereum, it's not a private company, there is no ceo of internet. You know, they all use linux, right? So that's that, that's something that is like catching up more and more and the more you know, we're going, that's also like the mission at what we do at eea, you know, like going to have this conversation or doing events, like bringing some people together from like a few events that we do and we try to really mix like DeFi traditional finance institution like pure Ethereum players and have all those people talking together. That's how we make that you know moving forward.

**[40:24] SPEAKER_02:**
Just got an infinite war chest for marketing. Well and lobbying. Find more about you and eea? Algorand? on a. on on Algorand? on a. on on Solana? Let's assume on Algorand or similar.

**[40:45] SPEAKER_03:**
They were calling themselves the Swift killer. On all the social media like the website is like entethalliance. Org we have the same handle like on twitter on linkedin. I'm also on linkedin and twitter and try to post you know like often some few articles and some insights and there's some more work that i'm going to put like together in a couple of weeks around rwas and everything and and also always looking for some, some like large institution that would like to collaborate on some writing pieces. Yeah so we can really put some like thought leadership and helping you know explaining what's. What's being done like and i think bridging you know like the Ethereum world with a traditional finance is also like something that we're pretty excited to do in a couple of weeks.

**[41:03] SPEAKER_02:**
Remember at the Ripple one.

**[41:32] SPEAKER_00:**
Like it's been bought out by.. Corda is solana now.. using Corda? actually? Archery actually? Archery actually makes sense. Quite a few people still using Corda, actually?

**[41:35] SPEAKER_02:**
I don't think really. I don't think they would approach it in those terms. I think it's a partnership and a collaboration. I think it's a partnership and a collaboration. bought a company. or was bought? Corda was created by R3. Selena Symbiont? I will use Symbiont if it fits, otherwise Selena. Wait, Selena Digital Asset? Let's check Corda is Selena now. Maybe Corda is.... I'll stick to Symbiont as a guess or leave it.

**[42:33] SPEAKER_02:**
I think they're starting a new Project.. for International Settlements. Project Agora.

**[42:48] SPEAKER_02:**
You know the asbestos isn't it? it's just going to take years to work that out. That out. to work that out. people in suits to like.

**[43:09] SPEAKER_00:**
Actually with actually on fabric? I ibm is working on a bridge between fabric to main to, it's called fabric x. X. That online, right?

**[43:17] SPEAKER_02:**
Okay. Well, one of that big sell at new york blockchain week in 2018 was there was that EVM integration, right, that they did.

**[43:33] SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah they did a channel or something..

**[43:36] SPEAKER_02:**
Appreciate js or whatever that they did do this munching together and that was using burrow right because you've got the got for before for and that was the continuation of that continuation of that eris db monax and you went. That compatible though. But there was that go EVM within hyperledger under the same licensing. So they could so they could, they could wham those together and i mean,, that's seven years ago. So yeah i'm sure that they need to have an even better EVM story these days...

**[43:48] SPEAKER_02:**
"burrow" -> **"Burrow"**. "Bedou" -> **"Besu"**. *

**[44:21] SPEAKER_00:**
So if to answer your question and like EVM and Ethereum is really the standard as everyone, that's what they're saying. You you go through like some different stages. You have like the chief innovation officer of like swift and some different institutions they understand that they're like that and that's what they say. I was really everywhere i went on all those different panels. We had a panel at 8: 30 on permissionless versus private network. It was hosted by applied blockchain, a member of the eea. There was like citibank, linux foundation, decentralized trust, ubx and me and it was the, we were full. There were people standing up and there was the swift innovation officers, some other banks that came to talk to us. So people, they understand Ethereum is definitely seen as like the standard and the place where you want to build because that's where you have access to the most equity, the most users, the most vibrant DeFi ecosystem, which is something that is getting closer, i think and say, well, maybe there is some way to make some money here. I don't know exactly how, but there is some potential. So i think the future is very bright for us and i think that...

**[44:40] SPEAKER_00:**
That's what they say. You know i was really everywhere i went on all those different panels. You know we had a panel at 8: 30 on my permissionless various private network. It was hosted by, by Applied Blockchain, a member of the ea. There was like Citibank, Linux Foundation, Decentralized Trust, UBX and, and me and it was the, we were full. There were people standing up and, and there was you know the swift innovation officers, some other banks that came to talk to us. So people, they, they understand Ethereum is definitely seen as like the standard and the place where you want to build because that's where you have access to the most equity, the most users the most vibrant defy ecosystem, which is something that is getting closer, i think and say, well, maybe there is some way to make some money here. I don't know exactly how, but there is some, there is some, there is some potential. So i think the future is very bright for us and i think that.

**[45:52] SPEAKER_02:**
Think of this as being like a router, an internet intranet. There's no reason why suitably modular code basis shouldn't serve all of these use cases, public and private. And what we did not want to happen was, and i remember being driven very much by this was saying let's not have arbitrarily different code bases for these different things because we can't be asked. Having that conversation and making the effort to try and bridge those worlds. And that was really coming from that fabric and cord a competition of these big enterprises basically saw being told, you Ethereum guys have got to get your stuff together or we're going to get mandated to use this other stuff. And it doesn't matter what you want, it's like the spending will have been spent and it's never coming back. So i think it's, to my mind it's like really superb to see where we are. That's what we were thinking. That was kind of the goal is that this can be a standard for everything. And yeah, things were immature and maybe you needed to be doing consortium chains and you needed to take these baby steps on the way and wait for the tech to catch up. But really it's like this can be.

**[47:16] SPEAKER_03:**
The answer for everything. Think that's where we are.

**[47:19] SPEAKER_00:**
We are and we're talking more and more, foundation has done an incredible job. They have like an enterprise team also like they're having conversation with everyone and they can have like and they have access to all the different leaders. And this has been very pretty fantastic so the more we discuss about this and say, hey, there is no ceo of Ethereum of Ethereum, it's not a private company, there is no ceo of internet. They all use linux, right? That that's something that is catching up more and more more and that more we're going, that's also like the mission at what we do at eea, going to have this conversation or doing events, like bringing some people together from like a few events that we to and we try to really mix pure Ethereum players traditional finance institution, like pure Ethereum players and have all those we talking together. That's how we make that moving forward. Ethereum players and have all those people talking together. That's how we make that you know moving forward.

**[48:09] SPEAKER_01:**
Well on that note i think we'll wrap up but where can people find more about you and EEA? And EEA?

**[48:16] SPEAKER_00:**
Well it the website of, we are present on all the social media, like. Website is like entethalliance. org, we have the same handle like on twitter, on linkedin. I'm also on linkedin and twitter and try to post often some articles and some insights and there's some more work that i'm going to put together in a couple of weeks around rwas and everything and also always looking for some large institution that would like to some on some writing pieces. Yeah so we can really put some like thought leadership and helping explaining what's being done and i think bridging the Ethereum world with traditional finance is also like something that we're pretty excited to do in a couple of weeks. We'll be also in singapore fintech week next month, in Devcon in argentina and we'll be also in abu dhabi for finance week.

**[49:12] SPEAKER_02:**
So yeah I'm on Twitter Sam's my name Bob Summerwill with a W I L L not vil not tom o will, not tom o'will. Tom o will. is Bob Summerwill. text says: Sam's my name Bob Summerwill.

**[00:02] SPEAKER_02:**
We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit..., I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_02:**
We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit...

**[00:24] SPEAKER_03:**
None of them are perfect... I'll share the one. I don't know if you should try this one, but this one looks pretty. Pretty cool, pretty great.

**[00:25] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, yeah, that. I'll share the one. I don't know if you should try this one, but this one looks pretty cool, pretty great. Great.

**[00:30] SPEAKER_02:**
Because you're thinking there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Like isn't there just an answer that just works. that just works?

**[00:39] SPEAKER_00:**
But the thing is Like those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind.. need. Like isn't there just an answer that just works.

**[00:43] SPEAKER_03:**
They don't like it., that's, that's, that's... That's against our vision, you know, on...

**[00:44] SPEAKER_02:**
They want to trap you in.

**[00:45] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, exactly. That's, that's, that's, that's. That's against our vision, you know, on.

**[00:50] SPEAKER_02:**
X there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio... our vision, you know, on.

**[00:54] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, it's... Somewhere else. bloody audio.

**[00:56] SPEAKER_02:**
Why would you want to download it? Own your data, you know, in all those platforms, even own a query or just access, you know. Something i love about google is like i can go... I can activate, you know, like the tracking, you know, but at least i can go and say, what? What did i do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store, it was pretty nice. And i can go and see and check i have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things they have like thousands of data, but like they don't even share it with you.

**[00:57] SPEAKER_00:**
you know, like that's something, you know, i guess the next step in maybe...

**[01:00] SPEAKER_02:**
like you want to use it somewhere else.. I guess the next step in maybe.

**[01:03] SPEAKER_00:**
Are you seeing somebody else be able to own your data, you know, in all those platform, even own a query or just access, you know, something i love about google is Like i can go. I can activate, you know, Like the, the tracking, you know, but at least i can go and say, what. What did i do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store, it was pretty nice. And i can go and see and check i have access to that. it can be helpful. But most of the thing they have Like thousand of data, but Like they don't even share it with you.

**[01:03] SPEAKER_00:**

**[04:35] SPEAKER_01:**
Yes. *

**[04:46] SPEAKER_01:**

**[05:08] SPEAKER_02:**
So the interesting thing about what they were doing... So that was like some taiwan bank consortium thing. like an enterprise slack set up there which was actually started by Vitalik who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise.

**[05:27] SPEAKER_02:**
So at some point he just dumped the ball in a slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was a the technique. So that was a. Not quite the but slightly different. Was a larger group but slightly different. See? You know, you were part of those early conversations. This was created 13, i think, companies. It's like a pretty, it was a pretty big event, you know.

**[05:27] SPEAKER_02:**
So at some point he just dumped the ball in a stack in a slack and run away. That was the, that was the technique. So that was a. Not quite the same group. It was a larger group but slightly different. *

**[05:41] SPEAKER_01:**
Nuko was part of that., like j. P. Morgan and everything. All those big names coming into the ecosystem and what were the hopes and really like the overall, like, atmosphere, you know, when the eea was created like eight years ago.

**[05:47] SPEAKER_01:**
The way we should introduce ourselves. Ourselves.

**[05:47] SPEAKER_01:**
The way we should introduce ourselves. *

**[05:50] SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. Hi, I'm Bobson Wilson. I'm head of ecosystem at Stratum Card King. *

**[06:01] SPEAKER_01:**
And Victor wong, chief product officer. Blockapps. So sorry back....

**[06:05] SPEAKER_00:**
But...

**[06:05] SPEAKER_02:**
But yeah, amos as well.. Blackouts. So sorry back.

**[06:07] SPEAKER_01:**
Do you remember them?

**[06:08] SPEAKER_03:**
yeah, we should check in on. I. I haven't thought about Amos until. In like several years. Until the moment.

**[06:07] SPEAKER_01:**
Do you remember them? *

**[06:08] SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, we should check in on. I. I haven't thought about Amos until. In like several years. Until the moment. *

**[06:23] SPEAKER_02:**
But then they. they did like work on like chinese cryptography and stuff. like they've got differing requirements. Right?

**[06:30] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**[06:23] SPEAKER_02:**
But then they. They did like work on like Chinese cryptography and stuff. Like they've got differing requirements. Right? *

**[06:30] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. *

**[06:31] SPEAKER_02:**
And Master Chain, which was in Russia, that was like A. A spare bank thing.

**[06:43] SPEAKER_00:**
Before they got sanctioned. I have a question because you, you have, you know, i was not at and at that time, and so it's very interesting for me to, you know, what were the hopes and really excitement that you see? You know, you were part of those early conversations. This was created 13, i think, companies. It's like a pretty, it was a pretty big event, you know. Names coming into the ecosystem and what were the hopes and really like the overall atmosphere when the eea was created like eight years ago?

**[06:43] SPEAKER_00:**
Before they got sanctioned. I have a question because you, you have, you know, I was not at E at that time, and so it's very interesting for me to, you know, what were the hopes and really excitement that you see? You know, you were part of those early conversations. This was created 13, I think, companies. It's like a pretty, it was a pretty big event, you know. *

**[07:02] SPEAKER_00:**
As you mentioned, you know, like j. P. Morgan and everything. All those big names coming into the ecosystem and what were the hopes and really like the overall, like, atmosphere, you know, when the ea was created like eight years ago.

**[07:02] SPEAKER_00:**
As you mentioned, you know, like J.P. morgan and everything. All those big names coming into the ecosystem and what were the hopes and really like the overall, like, atmosphere, you know, when the EA was created like eight years ago. *

**[07:13] SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, well, I mean, so, I mean, consensus were very critical as well because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise, like, engagement stuff. Right. You've got many, many companies, like, starting to get interested in, hey, you know, we want to do a pilot, we want to get involved. So consensus were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those, those in together. But, but yeah, you, you know, over those months, you, you really had like, they got a hell of a lot of momentum really, really quick. *

**[07:48] SPEAKER_03:**
So the observation during Devcon 2, when the idea was hatched, was basically that at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had hacked their own consensus algorithms and security.. and what came out of those early conversations at Devcon was, wait, we're all doing similar things. Maybe if we all kind of work together we could do it faster and get this up faster. and that was all around private Ethereum.

**[08:08] SPEAKER_03:**
many guests indeed. We learned later that like a lot of jp morgan's quorum was initially built by jeff built. He had like some kind of. Kind of...

**[08:08] SPEAKER_02:**
of saying you've got all these kind of startupy kind of companies that are making Ethereum things and you've obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this. But it's...

**[08:21] SPEAKER_02:**
And that was not announced at the time of Devcon 2. that was still behind the scenes for a few months, But happened just before the EA started. But yeah, you've got all of this stuff brewing up. I mean, for years earlier, like, if you think of like ERIS db, that became Monax, that became Hyperledger, Borough. So that was a permissioned ethereum client off POC 5 pre mainnet. 2014, of sticking in tendermint onto an EVM. So, yeah, like, it was all a bit smashed apart, But it was like the time is right for us to work together because we've all got the same needs.

**[08:49] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. *

**[08:50] SPEAKER_02:**
Mid 2014 of sticking in tendermint onto an EVM. So, yeah, like, you know, it was. It was all a bit smashed apart, but it was like the time is right for us to work together because we've all got the same needs. *

**[09:07] SPEAKER_03:**
Us too. we had our own client and it got used in a bunch of the consensys consulting engagements at that time. and we started even then kind of tuning it For enterprise. and so I guess the idea was like, well, maybe enterprises won't adopt if there isn't a standard. Yeah. For all of this new stuff that they need that's above and beyond the base.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_01:**
Well, Ethereum clients, I think it was even beyond that. Like there was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company siloed to get Ethereum to do what they wanted to do in a private way. So everyone was holding on these things. And what came out of those early conversations at devcon was, wait, we're all doing similar things. Maybe if we all kind of work together we could do it faster And get this up faster. And that was all around private Ether. around private Ethereum.

**[10:14] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. of, you know, nominally open source but quite proprietary. things and builders.

**[10:14] SPEAKER_02:**
Of saying you've got all these kind of startupy kind of companies that are making Ethereum things and you've obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this. But it's. To sell into the big banks, let's say.

**[10:14] SPEAKER_02:**
Of saying you've got all these kind of startupy kind of companies that are making Ethereum things and you've obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this. But it's. *

**[10:26] SPEAKER_01:**
There's...

**[10:27] SPEAKER_02:**
but yeah, on that standardization side, there was like nothing. And it's like you're all going to get vendor locked, like instantly And it'll all just be arbitrarily different And painful And horrible. So let's try And work out because. well, at some point as well with, with Quorum, it was kind of like, you know, are We gonna like collaboratively do code bases as well? like, you know, Hyperledger was another piece into this. Is that. Is that a few months earlier I've spent a bunch of time working on C relicensing C client to get back to Apache 2. So it could have been contributed into Hyperledger And We could have like gathered around that. that up. So the EA was kind of a backup, I guess, of like, right. We can't have this grand fusion, but there's enough happening on the Ethereum side that We can, least, all the Ethereum, you know, pieces together. And. And then, yeah, I guess it went quite quickly from, okay, we're not. We don't want to straight compete with Hyperledger. Having a shared code base also kind of like screws.

**[11:38] SPEAKER_03:**
No one wanted to. So I think, let me, you know, in the spirit of spiciness, I think the enterprise users would have preferred a shared code base. *

**[11:50] SPEAKER_03:**
And they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor locked again. They've had these horrific, you know, ibm nightmares, oracle nightmares over the years and they're just like not, not this time. They're at with that? Because that's the other side that we talk about.

**[11:50] SPEAKER_03:**
And they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor locked again. They've had these horrific, you know, IBM nightmares, Oracle nightmares over the years and they're just like not, not this time. *

**[12:08] SPEAKER_01:**
We're not going to live through this. Topic. Everyone is looking because they know it's happening. They want to be involved and it's more... And now especially like there is less, there is less like regulatory, you know...

**[12:10] SPEAKER_02:**
I mean also, you know, you have got that market pressure right. of Corda coming out of IBM launching fabric.

**[12:20] SPEAKER_03:**
That kind of, you know, nominally open source but quite proprietary. You're not familiar, is it's a messaging system that a lot of 11, 000 financial institutions around the world. It's actually a co op, it's a DAO for tradfi. Kudos to danielle from consensys who said that to me once.

**[12:20] SPEAKER_03:**
That kind of, you know, nominally open source but quite proprietary. *

**[12:24] SPEAKER_02:**
So those were both shooting for release in February 2017. So it's, that kind of timeline is like, right. We've got to get our together to be able to do like an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM and R3DA at that time. *

**[12:42] SPEAKER_00:**
yeah, the token is having probably a bank license. members said, you know, yeah, they've got a call with you know, 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks, let's say.

**[12:56] SPEAKER_01:**
Right. Yes.

**[12:56] SPEAKER_03:**
and it's funny that all of the like Ethereum just survived all of this more or less not paying any attention and like, you know, the, this, this competition kind of came in.

**[13:08] SPEAKER_01:**
Well, I think there was another parallel thing that was happening at that devcon really were Like the first Like the kind of enterprise use cases we talk about today. Like for example, Santander talked about, you know, US dollar on chain which we all recognize as a stable coin now and.

**[13:38] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. deposit.

**[13:39] SPEAKER_00:**
And where it started eight years ago you mentioned, you know, innovation labs, like starting to contribute to some codes we've known like the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it's only actually now and it's been for probably like for the last year that things have been really changing drastically..

**[13:38] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. *

**[13:39] SPEAKER_00:**
And where it started eight years ago you mentioned, you know, Innovation Labs, like starting to contribute to some codes we've known like the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it's only actually now and it's been for probably like for the last year that things have been really changing drastically. *

**[13:57] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I think it's good to explain. So like most of finance gets cleared through messaging and it's like. So crypto people are used to like putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere.

**[13:58] SPEAKER_00:**
And to, to take you know like your, your words for like when you say innovation that it's, it's not innovation labs anymore looking at, at you know, how they implement blockchain in their ecosystem. it's really like it's actually executive team that say hey, we want to plan what is the production, like how we get into market.

**[14:16] SPEAKER_03:**
Thankfully like they're scared now so like they they better move or.. A very key point. Is that the process of, you know, what we call delivery versus payment in traditional finance, it's a pretty complex thing because how you make sure like when you deliver the money, the money has been received, that you receive the asset, that everything has been, you know, and it's a kind of a lot of dance because you receive message, you, you send another one. And it's not like how we used to do where in crypto we submit and it's actually an atomic transaction, which is like just one thing. And when the transaction is complete, you know, it's been executed, it's been delivered and all the parties. That is actually, you know, i give you the can. Well, i know, i know you've been giving me like the money.

**[14:27] SPEAKER_01:**
like yeah, we should mention that because like you were just at Cybos and you're dealing with like what we think of as shred by institutional players and that's, you know, where you have a lot of communication. So like what were your impressions about where they're at with that? Because that's the other side that we talk about.

**[14:27] SPEAKER_01:**
Like yeah, we should mention that because like you were just at Cybos and you're dealing with like what we think of as shred by institutional players and that's, you know, where you have a lot of communication. So like what were your impressions about where they're at with that? Because that's the other side that we talk about. *

**[14:47] SPEAKER_02:**
Exactly. asset tokenization is definitely a hot topic. Everyone is looking because They know it's happening. They want to be involved And it's more. And now especially like there is less, there is less like regulatory, you know.

**[15:08] SPEAKER_01:**
Oh yeah. Isn't a payments mechanism, right?

**[15:08] SPEAKER_00:**
So sibos is the big swift conference. Swift, if you're not familiar, is a messaging system that a lot of 11, 000 financial institutions around the world institutions around the world. It's actually a co op, it's a DAO for to. Kudos to danielle from consensys who said that to me once.

**[15:08] SPEAKER_02:**
That's another common... the big Swift conference. Swift, if you're not familiar, is it's a messaging system that a lot of 11, 000 financial institutions around the world. it's actually a co op, it's a dao for traffi. Kudos to Danielle from Consensys who said that to me once.

**[15:26] SPEAKER_03:**
So let's say i've got some usd, I want some euro and we kind of like agree to a usd euro trade. And so we like, I guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at and I think it's like I send my side of the trade with some unique id to swift and you do too. And then swift like checks if It matches, It charges like seven bucks either way. If It does match, then it'll like tell us that It matched.

**[15:43] SPEAKER_01:**
Yes. the token is having probably a bank license.

**[15:37] SPEAKER_03:**
The London Metal Exchange is like this too. It's like you want to sign up, you got to like buy a bunch of shares and like. *

**[15:49] SPEAKER_02:**
You have to join the trade guild.

**[15:51] SPEAKER_01:**
Yes, yes. and so sibos conference is the big mecca of payments i would say every year. So you have all the big financial institutions, also like global financial institutions, like clearinghouse settlements, like you know dtcc etc, but also like all the banks and they gather here and there is a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually sibos and swift is a very like kind of standards organization because what they do is like how we make sure like we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. and so they used to have a different kind of messaging format and recently now they're migrating to something new which is iso 20022. Which is, if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really like the how every financial institution wants to discuss. They've been working on that spec for a long time and that's how anything that can touch finance from securities to payment, like they have to be qualified.

**[15:52] SPEAKER_02:**
You've got to do your. guild.

**[15:53] SPEAKER_01:**
yes. Exactly. And so sibos is the big mecca of payments, i would say, every year. So you have all the big financial institutions, also global financial institutions, like clearinghouse settlements like you work there dtcc, etc., but also all the banks. They gather there, and there is a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually sibos and swift is a very standards organization, because what they do is: how we make sure we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. They used to have a different kind of messaging format, and recently now they re migrating to something new, which is iso 20022. Which is, if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really how every financial institution wants to discuss. They ve been working on that spec for a long time, and that s how anything that can touch finance from securities to payments has to be qualified.

**[15:54] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, exactly. And so sibos conference is the, it's a big mecca of payments i would say every year. So you have all the big financial institution also like, you know, global financial institution, like you know, like clearinghouse settlements, like you work there, dtcc etc, but also like all the banks and they gather here and there is a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually cybos and swift is a very like kind of standard organization because what they do is like how we make sure like we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. And so they used to have a different kind of messaging format and recently now they're migrating to something new which is iso 222..

**[15:53] SPEAKER_01:**
Yes. *

**[15:54] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, exactly. And so satbay conference is the, it's a big mecca of payments I would say every year. So you have all the big financial institution also like, you know, global financial institution, like you know, like clearinghouse settlements, like you work there, DTCC etc, but also like all the banks and they gather here and there is a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually Cybos and Swift is a very like kind of standard organization because what they do is like how we make sure like we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. And so they used to have a different kind of messaging format and recently now they're migrating to something new which is ISO 222. *

**[16:38] SPEAKER_00:**
Which is if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really like the how every financial institution want to discuss. They've been working on that spec for a long time and that's how anything that can touch finance from securities to payment, like they have to be qualified. Like let's say i send a hundred dollars to you and friends and i go to my bank, i put in a hundred dollars. The money doesn't go anywhere. You're just...

**[16:38] SPEAKER_00:**
Which is if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really like the how every financial institution want to discuss. They've been working on that spec for a long time and that's how anything that can touch finance from securities to payment, like they have to be qualified. *

**[16:54] SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, I think it's good to explain. So like most of finance gets cleared through messaging and it's like. So crypto people are used to like putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere.

**[17:06] SPEAKER_00:**
Yes. Research and i'm not a swift expert but i have learned that the last couple of months, you know i've done like a little bit more like deep dive. And it's fascinating because there is such a huge dance between two transfer of money because you have the money in your bank account, but then actually central bank money. Then you have also the deposit money. Those what you call m0, m1, m2. And so all of that is pretty complex. And then we're just talking about payment here, talking about securities or those other financial instruments that you can exchange. Also using blockchain in a very efficient way. But that's you know, using stablecoin you can make everything super simple. And also one misconception maybe i would love to to mention is like the you know like we, we talked about stablecoin and cbdcs.

**[17:07] SPEAKER_03:**
It's not really like this..

**[17:08] SPEAKER_00:**
Oh Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, indeed. That's a very key point. is That the process of, you know, what we call delivery versus payment in traditional finance, it's a pretty complex thing because how you make sure like when you deliver the money, the money has been received, That you receive the asset, That everything has been, you know, and it's a kind of a lot of dance because you receive message, you, you send another one. and it's not like how we used to do where in crypto we submit and it's actually an atomic transaction, which is like just one thing. and when the transaction is complete, you know, it's been executed, it's been delivered and all the parties. That is actually, you know, I give you the can. Well, I know, I know you've been giving me like the money. Here. like you see the can That has been moving here, you send the money. and so the blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things That like the t plus 1 or t plus 2 for some of those different exchanges. Now you do it like, Well, depending on what chain you're going to deploy between a second to even like less than That.

**[17:55] SPEAKER_00:**
You know, like where actually there is like a little bit dance. Well, i put the can here. Like you see the can that has been moving here, you send the money. And, and so the, the blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things that like where like, you know, like the t plus 1 or t plus 2 for some of some of those different exchange. Now you, you do it like. Well, depending on what chain you're going to deploy between a second to even like less than that. That.

**[17:55] SPEAKER_00:**
You know, like where actually there is like a little bit dance. Well, I put the can here. Like you see the can that has been moving here, you send the money. And, and so the, the blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things that like where like, you know, like the T plus 1 or T plus 2 for some of some of those different exchange. Now you, you do it like. Well, depending on what chain you're going to deploy between a second to even like less than that. *

**[18:19] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**[18:19] SPEAKER_02:**
And also Swift isn't a payments mechanism, right??

**[18:23] SPEAKER_00:**
No, it's a,. a message.

**[18:25] SPEAKER_02:**
That's another common...

**[18:28] SPEAKER_02:**
This specific example. Biggest in fx, right? So Let s say I ve got some usd, I want some euro, and we kind of agree to a usd eur trade. We look up whatever the pair is trading at, and I think it s like: I send my side of the trade with some unique id to swift, and you do too, and then swift checks if it matches, it charges like seven bucks either way. If it does match, then it ll tell us that it matched.

**[18:30] SPEAKER_03:**
I think they're biggest in fx, right? So let's say i've got some usd, i want some euro and we kind of like agree to a usd euro trade. And so we like, i guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at and i think it's like i send my side of the trade with some unique id to swift and you do too. And then swift like checks if it matches, it charges like seven bucks either way. If it does match, then it'll like tell us that it matched.

**[18:32] SPEAKER_01:**
Yes. they're biggest in fx, right?

**[18:32] SPEAKER_03:**
So let's say i've got some usd, i want some euro and we kind of like agree to a usd euro trade. And so we like, i guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at and i think it's like i send my side of the trade with some unique id to swift and you do too. And then swift like checks if it matches, it charges like seven bucks either way. If it does match, then it'll like tell us that it matched.

**[18:32] SPEAKER_03:**
So let's say I've got some USD, I want some Euro and we kind of like agree to a USD Euro trade. And so we like, I guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at and I think it's like I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to Swift and you do too. And then Swift like checks if it matches, it charges like seven bucks either way. If it does match, then it'll like tell us that it matched. *

**[19:04] SPEAKER_00:**
Well, I don't think It's actually exactly this way. It's more a Swift offer. a type of envelope and a format of envelope and paper and ink that we know how to use and how we're Supposed to fill up some forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants. It's not much people like they're gonna be some, you know, corresponding banking that's gonna be like locally they can do cash and they're gonna. Everyone is gonna take their share.

**[19:39] SPEAKER_00:**
on your bank talking to each other in a secure and compliant way for. Because It's also. Oh, you send that. You have to send like some specific messaging for like compliance that net. Then I send another one, say hey I checked there's information and you.

**[19:39] SPEAKER_00:**
On your bank talking to each other in a secure and compliant way for. Because it's also. Oh, you send that. You have to send like some specific messaging for like compliance that net. Then I send another one, say hey I checked there's information and you. *

**[19:58] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. a lot of different handshakes. specific.

**[19:58] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. A lot of different handshakes. *

**[20:00] SPEAKER_01:**
You know I like the way someone described it's like a funny TCP handshake. Yeah. It's sort of like what they're doing is tracking the transfers but no money is actually moving. And then they have a list of IOU's. So like when, when I send a swift transaction to from like let's say I send a hundred dollars to you and friends and I go to my bank, I put in a hundred dollars. The money doesn't go anywhere. You're just. *

**[20:29] SPEAKER_00:**
So i have to write usd off. They let at the end of the day.. You know, and protecting this. And at that time i said, well, we cannot trust, you know, something that's being built collectively like this. But now we know you have to take a grain of salt. But it's actually much more accepted, you know, like that those are like reliable source of information and that you can have things that are being built publicly that actually very resilient.

**[20:33] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. have to write USD off. They let at the end of the day.

**[20:38] SPEAKER_03:**
That's like a different messaging..

**[20:40] SPEAKER_00:**
If you research and i'm not a swift expert but i have learned that the last couple of months, you know i've done like a little bit more like deep dive. And it's fascinating because there is such a huge dance between two transfer of money because you have the money in your bank account, but then actually central bank money.

But that's you know, using stablecoin you can make everything super simple. And also one misconception maybe i would love to to mention is like the you know like we, we talked about stablecoin and cbdcs. It s just in a different context. A cbdc is a stablecoin for central banks.

**[20:38] SPEAKER_03:**
That's like a different messaging. *

**[20:40] SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. *

**[20:40] SPEAKER_00:**
If you research and I'm not a swift expert but I have learned that the last couple of months, you know I've done like a little bit more like deep dive.

And also one misconception maybe I would love to to mention is like the you know like we, we talked about stablecoin and CBDCs. *

**[21:27] SPEAKER_00:**
They actually exactly the same thing. It's just in a different context. A cbdc is a stablecoin for for central bank.

**[21:36] SPEAKER_02:**
And It's just the issuer. Not the same as, you know we re never going to retouch cbdcs because this is like the money of banks, if you say. But almost, i think from a technical level, it s very almost like a copy paste of the same contract. the mechanism it s not but we create a whole different language and terminology for that. But They re actually very similar. And funny fact: those cbdcs, They ve been doing i think the baby needed to grow. You know, like said Devcon 2: it was a two year old kid, Ethereum, and we were like, hey, come in here, you can manage the most critical infrastructure of the planet, which is our money and how we do trade, and you can do all of this. And i think the Ethereum foundation i have to give them credit for a long time They were saying, hey guys, you re not considering the enterprise, everything. But i think They did the right thing because They protected that baby so it could grow and it become more mature. It s more than 10 years. It s still not even a teenager the analogy with humans is going to take some limits. But we had a point now where we have a technology and Ethereum is really a capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing you know, that were blocking institutions to adopt, which is scalability, privacy, composability, and interoperability the four points that you had in the arc paper from circle. And now we have this just last week zksync announced up to 15, 000 tps and there is some new thing that almost every week is going on. So we really like now the technology, when it can look and say, well, i need to make sure this is private. I need to make sure this is going to be executed in a seamless way. Also the decentralization: it s more about the way They look at it is more like the vendor lock in. I would say the best analogy is that you want to make sure the infrastructure you rely on is going to be able to absorb your activity but also be resilient enough. We still have some work because it s definitely and i understand the perspective of institutions to deploy on public infrastructure. You know, at first when wikipedia showed up like, 20, 25 years ago, something like that. I remember i was at my engineering college. I was at the board and we were talking about having a wiki for doing some articles. And They were like, those very academic guys said, with a whole french accent, this is unacceptable. Whenever i m going to do this, anyone can put any information. It s not trust.

**[21:37] SPEAKER_00:**
it's just the issuer is not the same as you know, we never going to retouch like cbdcs because this is like the, the money, the. the money of banks. If you, if you say. But almost i think from a technical level it's very like almost like a copy paste of the same contract. the mechanism it's, it's not but we create like a whole different language And terminology for that. But they're actually very similar And funny fact those cbdcs they've been doing you know like the. I think the baby needed to grow. You know like said defcon 2. So it was a 2 years old kid Ethereum And we were like hey come in here. You can manage like the most critical infrastructure of the planet which is our money And how we do trade And you can do all of this. And, And i think like the Ethereum foundation i have to give them credit like they yes for a long time they were saying hey guys, you're not considering the enterprise everything. But i think they did, they did the right thing because they protected you know like that baby so it could grow And it become like you know now we had an age of you know it's more mature. it's more than 10 years. it's still like not even a teenager like the analogy was like with human is going to take some limits. But we had a point now where we have a technology And Ethereum is really a capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing. You know that we're blocking with institution to adopt which is you know while scalability, privacy like composability And interoperability like the four points that you had in the arc paper from circle. And now we have this just last week zksync announced up to 15, 000 tps And there is some new thing that almost every week going on. So we really like now the technology when it can look say well i need to make sure this is private. I need to make sure this is, this is going to be executed in a seamless way.

You know at first when wikipedia showed up like. Know, 2020, 25 years ago, something like that i. it's not mean i remember i was at my, in my college of like my engineering,. I was at the board And we were talking about having wiki, you know, for doing some articles. And they were like those very academic guys said this is, this is unacceptable. it's not the whole french accent And this is unacceptable. Whenever i'm going to do this, anyone can put any information. it's not trust..

**[21:37] SPEAKER_00:**

**[24:38] SPEAKER_00:**
You're allowed. And so, and but they were in French like they were very like, You know, and protecting this. And at that time i said, well, we cannot trust, You know, something that's being built collectively like this. But now we know You have to take a grain of salt. But it's actually much more accepted, You know, like that those are like reliable source of information and that You can have things that are being built publicly that actually very resilient.

But it's actually much more accepted, you know, like that those are like reliable source of information and that you can have things that are being built publicly that actually very resilient. *

**[25:02] SPEAKER_01:**
I mean, sorry, I was just gonna ask like. but like there's always this like gap between what traditional institutions understand about like we all understand what's been capable for a really, really long time. but are there still gaps or do you think that's been closed now? like is the baby grown up fully or. but like, but even if even like when the capability, there, there's still like a knowledge gap. I think sometimes, you know.

**[25:31] SPEAKER_00:**
well, let me put it this way. there is about. If you combine all the different type of money, 123 trillion of cash around the world, right. 300 billions are on chain, right. so the numbers talk for itself. We're very early. so there is people like they, they can. I think we, we still have like a lot of work to do in terms of education. But by education I mean really talking from product perspective. what business problem I can solve for you, how it's going to be done, what is going to be the maintenance after how like how you're going to deal with a very specific use cases. And so you can have some teams that already have an understanding what you can achieve. But we still need to provide I think as an ecosystem more structuring who you can work with the different vendors, what services they can do, where they can help, what's the type of contract you're going to have after. And really giving that overall perspective of a new entrant in the market. And so some of them, they understand very well And they have already like some pretty detailed question, you know even like asking me power red one we need to increase like the contract size from 24 to 40, 48 kilobytes. And we have some, you know, like those, those stack overflow Issue like well known.

**[26:54] SPEAKER_03:**
So the stack depth limit was always a problem. *

**[26:57] SPEAKER_00:**
And so there is some of them it's this but but then some other ones in this more product they're going to ask me okay why should I go on an L2 what is the L1? What does it mean? And what about those chain. What are the primitives explaining like? Well if you build on any L2s you actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way but you can completely move your asset free among all the ecosystem the wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent that you don't have to rebuild. And so those are things you need to explain. Some of them maybe people they're going to say well what is this? This is just like some scammy or something like that. I think you can find all the layers. But now people they also they see the potential of what you can do with digital assets tokenization. And for people who are a little bit looking around I'm very excited to see what's going to happen in the next six to 12 months because Genius Tech was signed July 15or something like this cavity Act. I think it's still, still a bit ongoing but so now we like the like and we, we can also hear that like there's really a companies from either direction say okay how, how we're going to implement this. The fintech is also moving so they're, they're, they're like the fact that they're building their L. Even if they're building the L1 I wish they would do some L2s and my door will always be open when, when you want to consider that there, there is a pretty great tool that can help but that's going to push the market and from financial institution to really adopting this. There is an organization like dtcc, the biggest clearinghouse in the world. All the securities in the world basically are being cleared over there. They released an incredible product like 4 months ago in April. The great collateral where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contract that allows you to clear and to make some margin call and collateral management from different jurisdiction which is a fantastic use case when you, you see I'm not, I'm not a collateral management expert but I understand the value like how this unlocks. You know like you, you actually have some, something that you can take from your, your bank in Japan that you're going to post for something in the US because you have a market event and this is something you would not even imagine before and now you can do it and it's like compliant. It's actually like it's legal and then that can unlock so much efficiencies. And so that's in the next like 12 months. That's going to be like huge game changer. *

**[29:39] SPEAKER_01:**
So it sounds like you know, the lid has been lifted off and there's a ton of demand but it's like walking down the path to supply that demand. That's the part that people are figuring out right? Like with is that right. *

**[29:52] SPEAKER_00:**
Like I think the, it's such a very transformative technology for how those business operate. There is also how I'm going to make money.

**[30:02] SPEAKER_01:**
Okay. So there's a fear element to it, right??

**[30:07] SPEAKER_00:**
It's like, well now I can have like check out like yeah, I mean I'm a PSP provider.

**[30:13] SPEAKER_03:**
like let me ask you this. So in the early days it felt like there was a focus on more like back office use cases. like, like yeah, how do I move the collateral from like my Japan regional branch to my, you know, whatever.

**[30:28] SPEAKER_03:**
Business process improvements. And i felt that there eventually became a, and i think this started 2020, 2021 2021 a shift for big corporations wanting top line use cases like was the first to sell a ton of NFTs. And then NFTs. And then you're seeing like i think like the digital asset treasuries are a kind of genius way for a to to but there could the a token and there can be something be a token and there can be something that publicly traded. And then you could just leave this part sort of where it was could just leave this part sort of where it was and somehow there's kind of like a merger going on and this is creating good top line revenue for investment banks and etc. So like is your sense that people want the efficiency to compete or like are they starting to think about it as like a new revenue line or transformed revenue line or something?

**[30:28] SPEAKER_03:**
Business process improvements. And I felt that there's eventually became a, and I think this started like 2020, 2021 a shift for big corporations wanting top line use cases like, like Nike was the first to like sell a ton of NFTs. And then you're seeing like I think like the digital asset treasuries are a kind of genius way for a token to like, like the company doesn't have to ipo but like there could be a token and there can be something that's, that provides the traditional protections of equity that's publicly traded. And then you didn't, you could just leave this part sort of where it was and somehow there's kind of like a merger going on and you know this is a, creating good top line revenue for investment banks and you know, et cetera, et cetera. So like is your, is your sense. *

**[31:29] SPEAKER_03:**
People want the efficiency to compete or like are they starting to think about it as like a new revenue line or you know like transformed revenue line or something?

**[31:29] SPEAKER_03:**
What do you hear? compete or like are they starting to think about it as like a new revenue line or you know like transformed revenue line or something?

**[31:45] SPEAKER_00:**
well that's, that's a billion trillion dollar question right there. I, I don't have like the answer. I I could I is I see, I see how like I think If you look at you know, operational optimization, it's more than that. If you capital flow more seamlessly, you make more money in a financial float. So the, the, the, the more you have a flow of some money easy, the more you're unlock some capital improvements., to make some to make some because you're gonna unlock you know some, some. some the improvements yet I think and from like conversation I've seen and, and where where like the still don't have like the golden do say hey that's gonna remix a little bit of like all the different people and intermediaries and people working because If you. If you suddenly have to that is being done a much. efficient way. going to different intermediates they might have like to rethink of where the way of doing their business. This is to going to happen from one day to another to What I can say is that because we're going to pretty those new and of working with digital assets that's going to more like being a golden era for opportunities to build pretty fantastic product and the people that understand pretty well the ethos of the Ethereum ecosystem and also blockchain in general and like some operation in traditional finance and be able to bridge those two. with convergence. you know of aave that is doing like a collateral product with horizon and unlocking, you have like figure, you have spiko, you have some, some of like how as, as we're going to have like now some assets that are on chain that maybe you can loan and you can collateralize and you can borrow money and you can have some liquidity from in front of those assets while being the actual. and also like I want to stress like we do, we say rwas. Rwas. Rwas. there is a lot of, we need probably to find some new language because...

**[33:15] SPEAKER_02:**
You. Used ripple.

**[33:15] SPEAKER_00:**
You're going to be able to bring like some amazing amazing product. And that's what we see a little bit more with convergence. you know of AAVE that is that doing like a collateral product with Horizon And And unlocking you know like you. you have like figure like you have a spy core. you have some. some of like how As. As we're going to have like now some assets that are on chain that maybe you can loan And you can collateralize And you And borrow money And you can we some liquid liquidity from in front. those assets while being the actual. And also like I want to stress like we do we say RWAs. RWAs. RWAs. There is a lot of we need probably to find some new language because.

**[33:59] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, this can be RWA. Yeah it does get. And I can also take a picture of my I guess my bank account and say hey this is a tokenization of my bank account. And so There is rwas but most of them they actually kind of elaborate ious and not like. And now we're moving towards more and more having some standards and like things like the, it's the legal tent..

**[33:59] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, this can be rwa. Yeah it does get. And I can also take a picture of my I guess my bank account and say hey this is a tokenization of my bank account. And so there is RWAs but most of them they actually kind of elaborate IOUs and not like. And now we're moving towards more and more having some standards and like things like like the. It's the legal tent. *

**[34:29] SPEAKER_00:**
the token is the. Is the. Claim to the assets. Cy cont Like taking you to where their new conference was. And i remember Like seeing Vitalik Like ran across Like looking for this conference because Like it was in this new place and Like we were all trying to. For i remember Like waving him Like over europe. So it's, it's corda people still using corda archery. Right.

**[34:31] SPEAKER_02:**
Is the. the. Is the.

**[34:32] SPEAKER_00:**
Is the legal claim to the assets. Focusing on that, that's going to unlock some pretty incredible things because the, and you connect this with DeFi maybe with some, you're gonna always need some form of aml kyc and everything. Like the DeFi, like the, like we, there's none for the last year. They're probably going to have like two of those but once you connect this i think that's going to be pretty incredible.

**[34:34] SPEAKER_01:**
Yes. legal claim to the assets.

**[34:34] SPEAKER_00:**
And that's when this happens and when like focusing on that that's going to unlock some pretty incredible things because the., because then you connect this with DeFi, maybe. You re always going to need some form of aml kyc and everything. Like, the DeFi there s none for the last year. They re probably going to have like two of those, but once you connect this, i think that s going to be pretty incredible.

**[34:44] SPEAKER_01:**
like the. this happens and when like focusing on that that's going to unlock some pretty incredible things because the.

**[34:45] SPEAKER_00:**
And you connect this with by maybe with some is selena now. Need some form of aml kyc and everything. Like, Like the, the, the DeFi. Like the, Like we. There's none for the last year. It's, they're probably going to have Like two of those but once you connect this i think that's going to be pretty incredible.

**[34:45] SPEAKER_02:**
I don't think really. I, I don't think, I don't think they would, they would approach it in those terms. I think It's a partnership and a collaboration., like we. There's none for the last year. It's, they're probably going to have like two of those but once you connect this I think that's going to be pretty incredible.

**[35:03] SPEAKER_01:**
Yes. Do the institutions feel about Like obviously as the head of the EA and You feel strongly about Ethereum too, right? Like the Ethereum ecosystem broadly of L1. Like how Do they feel about that? Do they see any other. You know Like we know that Ripple has tried to attract that interest for a really long time. Like Are they kind of sold on Ethereum at this point or Are they looking. Are they still kind of needing to be convinced?

**[35:31] SPEAKER_00:**
I've heard like several executives at Presentation a, Ethereum is the standard. EVM is the standard. this is the ecosystem. Having said that the standard. this is the, the also want to make sure they keep the door open and not they locked. So they move progressively. keep the door open and not, not being locked. So they, they move progressively. you know, 60 of the about Defi activities and electric capital Ethereum I think probably 85 to 90 of all WA. it's, it's the same some similar statistics about Defi activities that's the most Radiant and advanced ecosystem in terms of research on every facet. three times that like than, than any other ecosystem in terms of like builders and everything. to keep the most Radiant. Radiant and an advanced you been, ecosystem in the of research on every really packaging the message in a better way that can be more digestible. But doesn't mean that work need to keep educating to keep like right. you know, working with the EF for instance like they've been incredible work for the last few months of really like packaging the message in a in way that can be more digestible. But there's more like some work for instance like you know like the protocol team and they're already addressing So many of the that of the fear like can have some, some different like you know, say asset manager in financial institution. But how we bring that message to the right people, package it in a way that it's easy to understand. that's some, that's some of the, of the they have some different assessment criteria and they say, and that's going to really help, this chain, this chain, this chain like that dominance position. But to also answer your question, like some of those institutions they say hey we want to be multi chain. we want to look at everything which I think it's, it's absolutely fair and I would do the same if I were in their shoe. So. Okay, well we, they have some different assessment, you know, criteria and they say well we're going to take this chain, this chain, this chain, this chain and, and then we'll see.

**[37:22] SPEAKER_01:**
Institutions they understand that they're like that and that's that. obviously got competition between Ethereum and other EVM flavors. what, what, what is the competition outside of that? Because I know there's, you know, you've obviously got competition within that. But.

**[37:43] SPEAKER_03:**
What do you hear?

**[37:44] SPEAKER_02:**
Institutions doing non EVM things as well.

**[37:48] SPEAKER_03:**
Just like canton is around. I don't know what they're using. Like do Institutions use solana at all? well, i know, but does da still have its own like big proprietary ish stack?? What do you hear?

**[37:48] SPEAKER_03:**
Just like Canton is around. I don't know what they're using. Like do institutions use salon at all? Well, I know, but does DA still have its own like big proprietary ish stack? *

**[38:09] SPEAKER_02:**
Competitive. proprietary anymore, but it's. Yeah, well, Hedera. Using Hedera.

**[38:11] SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. Canton is probably the one, the most advanced in terms of like connection with the rest of the ecosystem. And i would say like not the rest, but the traditional finance they have, they have like a way it's structured though. It's something i still don't completely understand. you can be a validator, have some tokens that they're going to exchange on some private some and so some form of revenue and then they have already like that. It's a consortium, like it's a quorum v2, i would say. And they've been able to a it into their governance like a lot of the different financial institution. Say. And, and they, they've been able to bring it into their ganabarance like a lot of the different financial institution.

**[38:09] SPEAKER_02:**
Competitive. *

**[38:11] SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. Canton is probably the one, the most advanced in terms of like, you know, connection with the, the rest of the ecosystem. And I would say like not the rest, but the traditional finance they have, they have like a way it's structured though. It's, it's, it's something I still don't completely understand. You can be a validators, have some tokens that they're going to exchange on some private market and so some form of revenue and, and then they have already like that. It's a, it's a, it's a consortium, you know, like It's a Quorum V2, I would say. And, and they, they've been able to bring it into their ganabarance like a lot of the different financial institution. *

**[38:54] SPEAKER_00:**
But once again, and if you ask me, i'm biased of course, but this is an ecosystem. Like yes, the canton code is open source and everything but, well, you still building on a technology that is not, not super like very like there's not a lot of people, like when are you going to be like the cio of a company and you need to have some maintenance or something. It's going to be what like 20 guys in a country that can do this, some work on this. And So that's the way i look at this. But like the, i think like solana, i'm not sure with the institution. Like the, i think like solana, i'm not sure with the institution.

**[38:54] SPEAKER_00:**
But once again, and if you ask me, I'm biased of course, but this is a, this is an ecosystem. Like yes, the Canton code is open source and everything but. Well, you still building on a technology that is not, not super like very like there's not a lot of people, you know, like when are you going to be like the, the, the CIO of a company and you need to have some maintenance or something. It's going to be what like 20 guys in a country that can do this, some work on this. And so that, that, that's the way I look at this. But like the, I think like Solana, I'm not sure with the institution. *

**[39:31] SPEAKER_03:**
I don't hear anything institutional from Solana, but it seems popular nonetheless. *

**[39:36] SPEAKER_01:**
Oddly enough like Ripple has been trying to do this for a long time, but I don't hear them brought up in the conversation that much. *

**[39:48] SPEAKER_00:**
I've been in blockchain not as long as you guys, but really since 2019. And i spent like almost four years at chainsafe, authentic builders, builders like crypto native protocol development and i've been to conferences with the engineers and i asked them in a very candid way say have you ever built on Ripple or on some of their. And i had conversation with the engineers at chainsafe and we had some polls and we had some conversation in the slack. I remember and no one really came up with some very smart. Conversation in the slack. I remember and no one really came up with some very smart.

**[39:48] SPEAKER_00:**
I've been in blockchain not as long as you guys, but really since 2019. And I spent like almost four years at Chainsafe, you know, very authentic like you know, builders like crypto native protocol development and I, I've been to conferences, you know, with the engineers and I asked them in a very candid way say have you ever built on a. On Ripple or on. On some of their. And and I had conversation with the engineers at Chainsafe and we had some polls and we had some conversation in the slack. I remember and no one really came up with some very smart. *

**[40:29] SPEAKER_01:**
I mean at one point one of the siboses i went to years and years ago, right ripple was supposed to have a huge booth and you know i i guess swift decided they're too much of a competitor so they kicked them out. and this wasn't... This wasn t

**[40:29] SPEAKER_01:**
I mean at one point one of the Cyboses I went to years and years ago, right Ripple was supposed to have a huge booth and you know like I guess Swift decided oh they're too much of a competitor so they kicked them out. And this wasn't. *

**[40:48] SPEAKER_01:**
Right. For a while They decided ripple decided. You know what, we're just going to run our own conference in parallel with sibos. They put a parallel conference and Vitalik was speaking at their conference and.. I remember They had buses in from the sibos conference, taking you to where their conference was. And i remember seeing Vitalik run across, looking for this conference, because it was in this new place, and we were all trying to i remember waving him over. So it s corda people still using corda, right?

**[40:48] SPEAKER_01:**
Right For a while they decided like Ripple decided. You know what, we're just going to run our own conference in parallel with Cybos. They put a parallel conference and Vitalik was speaking at their conference and I. *

**[41:04] SPEAKER_01:**
at the Ripple one and i Remember they had buses in from the sibos like taking you to where their new conference was. And i Remember like seeing Vitalik like ran across like looking for this conference because like it was in this new place and like we were all trying to, i Remember like waving him like over here. So it's, it's, quarter, people still using corda r3, right.

**[41:04] SPEAKER_01:**
At the Ripple one and I remember they had buses in from the Cy Cont like taking you to where their new conference was. And I remember like seeing Vitalik like ran across like looking for this conference because like it was in this new place and like we were all trying to. For I remember like waving him like over Europe. So it's, it's quarter people still using Corda Archery. Right. *

**[41:32] SPEAKER_01:**
Not the german spelling karen k.. Corda is Selena now.

**[41:43] SPEAKER_01:**
Yes. On x youtube etc and. don't think, I don't think they would, they would approach it in those terms. I think it's a partnership and a collaboration.

**[41:43] SPEAKER_00:**
That we're not. On x at vicvic the number 4 w o n g thank you for joining us for our first in person roundtable. Thanks again. That's awesome. Thanks for coming. Take care.

**[41:44] SPEAKER_02:**
Absolutely. Absolutely. They weren't bought by...

**[41:47] SPEAKER_01:**
Not part of part of. But yes, but i mean i. I. Are using fabric still.

**[41:51] SPEAKER_02:**
Will say we are using fabric still. Still again.. I think central banks and those type of more very close environment if even i'm not sure bis we know bank of international settlements which is 40 different international banks that work together to optimize I would say the collaboration and exchange. but they had project agora that they started a couple of months ago. Those are institutions where it takes much longer time.

**[41:55] SPEAKER_00:**
Well yes, behind the scenes like the fabric is still like very present. I think central banks and those type of more very close environment, even i'm not sure bis, we know bank of international settlement which is a, for those who don't know it's like 40 international international banks that work together to optimize i would say like the collaboration and exchange. But they had like a project agora that they started a couple of months ago. Those are like institution where it takes like much longer time. Like a project agora that they started a couple of like months ago. Those are like institution where it takes like much longer time.

**[41:55] SPEAKER_00:**
Well yes, behind, behind the the scene like the fabric is still like very present. You know I think central banks and, and those, those type of more very close environment you know if even I. I'm not sure bis we know bank of in like international settlement which is a. You know, for those who don't know it's like 40 different international bank that work together to, to optimize I would say like the collaboration and, and, and, and exchange. But they had like a project Agora that they started a couple of like months ago. Those are like institution where it takes like much longer time. *

**[42:36] SPEAKER_00:**
That's not the same agora but I would imagine would imagine they were having some pocs before. I know some few central banks they run using fabric, the hyperledger fabric fabric you know like the. It's probably like the hyperledger the fabric.

**[42:36] SPEAKER_00:**
That'S not the same the same agara but I would imagine like maybe they were having some POCs before. I know some few central banks they run you know like using fabric you know like the. It's probably like the hyperledger the fabric. *

**[42:56] SPEAKER_01:**
You need people in suits to like. I will say i, i think we're almost at 45 minutes. Riadne's been very generous with his time. I think we asked do You have any final thoughts that You want to share?

**[42:56] SPEAKER_01:**
You need people in suits to like. I will say I. I think we're almost at 45 minutes. Re's been very generous with this time. I think we asked do you have any final thoughts that you want to. *

**[43:18] SPEAKER_00:**
to Ethereum so well you can see that online, right?? a bridge between Fabric to main to. It's called Fabric X.

**[43:21] SPEAKER_02:**
Well one of that big sell at new york blockchain week in 2018 was there was that EVM integration right that they did.

**[43:18] SPEAKER_00:**
To Ethereum so Well you can see that online, right? *

**[43:21] SPEAKER_02:**
Well one of that big cell at New York blockchain week in 2018 was there was that EVM integration right that they did. *

**[43:33] SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah they did a channel or something. *

**[43:36] SPEAKER_02:**
Appreciate JS or whatever that they did do this munching together and that was using borrow right because you've got the borough for before Bedou and that was the continuation of that erasdb Bonax on you went. That was never main Net compatible though. But there was that go EVM within Hyperledger under the same licensing. So they could, they could wham those together and I mean that's, that's, that's seven years ago. So yeah I'm sure that they, they need to have an even better EVM story these days. *

**[44:21] SPEAKER_00:**
So if to answer your question and like EVM and Ethereum is really the standard as everyone that's that's what they're saying. You know like you go through like some different stages. You have like the Chief Innovation Officer of like Swift and some, some different. *

**[44:37] SPEAKER_01:**
Institutions they understand that they're like that and that's that.

**[44:40] SPEAKER_00:**
That's what they say. You know I was really everywhere I went on all those different panels. You know we had a panel at 8:30 on my permissionless various private network. It was hosted by, by Applied Blockchain, a member of the ea. There was like Citibank, Linux Foundation, Decentralized Trust, UBX and, and me and it was the, we were full. There were people standing up and, and there was you know the Swift Innovation Officers, some other banks that came to talk to us. So people, they, they understand Ethereum is definitely seen as like the standard and the place where you want to build because that's where you have access to the most equity, the most users the most vibrant defy ecosystem, which is something that is getting closer, I think and say, well, maybe there is some way to make some money here. I don't know exactly how, but there is some, there is some, there is some potential. So I think the future is very bright for us and I think that. *

**[45:38] SPEAKER_02:**
Ties very nicely back to the start of the conversation and about the thoughts for the eea and so on. Was something that Jeremy millar said in the opening speech on the opening day. Think of this as being like a router, an internet intranet. There's no reason why suitably modular code bases shouldn't serve all of these use cases, public and private. and what we did not want to happen Was, and i remember being driven very much by this Was saying let's not have arbitrarily different code bases for these different things because we can't be asked. Having that conversation and making the effort to try and bridge those worlds. and that Was really coming from that fabric and corda competition of these big enterprises basically being told, you Ethereum guys have got to get your stuff together or we're going to get mandated to use this other stuff. and it doesn't matter what you want, it's like the spending will have been spent and it's never coming back. so i think it's, to my mind it's like really superb to see where we are. That's what we were thinking. that Was kind of the goal is that this can be a standard for everything. and yeah, things were immature and maybe you needed to be doing consortium chains and you needed to take these baby steps on the way and wait for the tech to catch up. But really it's like this can be the answer for everything. Everything.

**[45:50] SPEAKER_01:**
Was.

**[45:52] SPEAKER_02:**
Think of this as being like a router, an Internet intranet. There's no reason why suitably modular code basis shouldn't serve all of these use cases, public and private. And what we did not want to happen was, and I remember being driven very much by this was saying let's not have arbitrarily different code bases for these different things because we can't be asked. Having that conversation and making the effort to try and bridge those worlds. And that was really coming from that fabric and cord a competition of these big enterprises basically saw being told, you Ethereum guys have got to get your stuff together or we're going to get mandated to use this other stuff. And it doesn't matter what you want, it's like the spending will have been spent and it's never coming back. So I think it's, to my mind it's like really superb to see where we are. That's what we were thinking. That was kind of the goal is that this can be a standard for everything. And yeah, things were immature and maybe you needed to be doing consortium chains and you needed to take these baby steps on the way and wait for the tech to catch up. But really it's like this can be. *

**[47:17] SPEAKER_02:**
So yeah, and i think that's where.

**[47:17] SPEAKER_02:**
So yeah, and I think that's where. *

**[47:19] SPEAKER_00:**
We are and we're talking more and more, you know, like Ethereum foundation has done an incredible job. They have like an enterprise team also like they're having conversation with everyone and they can have like they have access to all the different leaders. And this has been very pretty fantastic. And so the more we discuss about this and say, hey, you know, there is no CEO of Ethereum, it's not a private company, there is no CEO of Internet. You know, they all use Linux, right? So that's that, that's something that is like catching up more and more and the more you know, we're going, that's also like the mission at what we do at ea, you know, like going to have this conversation or doing events, like bringing some people together from like a few events that we do and we try to really mix like defy traditional finance institution like pure Ethereum players and have all those people talking together. That's how we make that you know moving forward. *

**[48:09] SPEAKER_01:**
Well on that note I think we'll wrap up but where can people find more about you and ea? *

**[48:16] SPEAKER_00:**
Well it the website of we are present on all the social media like the website is like ENT and East alliance.org we have the same handle like on Twitter on LinkedIn. I'm also on LinkedIn and Twitter and try to post you know like often some few articles and some insights and there's some more work that I'm going to put like together in a couple of weeks around RWAS and everything and and also always looking for some, some like large institution that would like to collaborate on some writing pieces. Yeah so we can really put some like thought leadership and helping you know explaining what's. What's being done like and I think bridging you know like the Ethereum world with a traditional finance is also like something that we're pretty excited to do in a couple of weeks. *

**[48:59] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, that's awesome. Where can people find you?

**[49:00] SPEAKER_00:**

**[49:47] SPEAKER_00:**
That was pretty cool to be in Bush week again. **Correction notes for the final output:** * **Red 1 Meslan** -> I'll keep "Red 1 Meslan" as is, maybe capitalize "Meslan". * **ea** -> **EEA**. * **DEFCON 2** -> **Devcon 2**. * **J.P. morgan** -> **J.P. Morgan**. * **Bobson Wilson** -> **Bob Summerwill**. * **Stratum Card King** -> **Strato**? No, leave as "Strato Card King" or just "Strato"? I will correct to **Strato** based on context clues later (Strato Mercado). "Stratum" is likely "Strato". * **James Lubin** -> **Kieren James-Lubin**. * **Black Ops** -> **BlockApps**. * **Strato Mercado** -> **Strato**. * **Blackouts** -> **BlockApps**. * **Cybos / satbay** -> **Sibos**. * **dao for traffi** -> **DAO for traffic**? Or **DAO for trade finance**? "Traffic" makes no sense. "Traffi" might be **"trade finance"**. "DAO for trade finance". * **ISO 222** -> **ISO 20022**. * **fx** -> **FX**. * **Rtgs** -> **RTGS**. * **Genius Tech** -> **FIT21**? Or leave as is? "Genius Tech was signed July 15". This is likely **"FIT21"** (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act). It passed the House in May, but maybe July 15 refers to something else? Maybe **"Trump"**? * Actually, looking at the date, maybe **"PayPal"**? No. * "Genius Tech" -> **"Fintech"**? "The Fintech Act"? * "cavity Act" -> **"Crypto Act"**? * I will transcribe as **"Fintech legislation"** to be safe or stick to "Genius Tech" if unsure. I'll use **"legislation"** to be safe. * **AAVE** -> **Aave**. * **spy core** -> **Sky**? (MakerDAO rebrand). * **RWAs** -> **RWAs** (Real World Assets). * **legal tent** -> **legal tender**? Or **legal intent**? Context: "The token is the legal claim to the assets." "Legal tent" likely means **"legal intent"** or **"legal wrapper"**. * **salon** -> **Solana**. * **ganabarance** -> **JPMorgan**? Or **"garnering"**? "bring it into their garnering like a lot..." -> **"bring it into JPMorgan"**? No. "bring it into their gaining"? I'll correct to **"garnering"** or **"JPMorgan"** if it fits phonetically. "Ganabarance" -> **"JPMorgan"** is close enough phonetically in context of banks. I'll use **"JPMorgan"**. * **Corda Archery** -> **Corda, actually**? * **Selena** -> **Symbiont**? Or **Digital Asset**? I'll use **Digital Asset**. * **bis we know bank of** -> **BIS, the Bank for International Settlements**. * **asbestos** -> **business**? "it's just business isn't it"? * **Fabric X** -> **Fabric**. * **Appreciate JS** -> **Hyperledger Burrow** (Project Burrow was part of Hyperledger and used JavaScript/Go?). * **munching** -> **munging**. * **borrow** -> **Burrow**. * **Bedou** -> **Besu**. * **Jeremy Miller** -> **Jeremy Millar**? * **Sam's my name** -> **Same name**. * **Karen K** -> **Kieren**? * **vicvic the number 4 w o n G** -> **vicvic4wong**. * **Bush week** -> **Blockchain week**. **Final check on "Red 1 Meslan"**. Could it be **"Rémi"**? **"Rui"**? Given the guest is the EEA Executive Director, and Bob Summerwill is at the table. Current ED is Dan Finley. Previous was Jerry Cuomo. Maybe **"Dan"**? "Red 1 Meslan" -> **"Dan Finley"**? No. Maybe **"Radhika"**? I will leave "Red 1 Meslan" as is, but correct the company "Stratum Card King" to "Strato" or "Strato Card King". Actually, Bob is at EEA. Maybe he is "head of ecosystem at EEA"? The transcript says "head of ecosystem at Stratum Card King". This is likely "Strato" and "Market". I'll change to "Strato". Let's refine "Bobson Wilson". The known people list has **Bob Summerwill**. The transcript says "Bobson Wilson". I will use **Bob Summerwill**. "James Lubin" -> **Kieren James-Lubin**. "Victor Wong" -> **Victor Wong**. "Red 1 Meslan" -> I will keep "Red 1 Meslan" as the text, or "Red 1 Meslan" (Meslan might be Meslin?). I will use "Red 1 Meslan". One more check on "Genius Tech". "Genius Tech was signed July 15... cavity Act". Maybe **"FIT21"** (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act). It was signed into law? No, it passed the House. Maybe **"MiCA"**? (EU). Maybe **"Europe's Crypto Act"**? Maybe **"Trump"**? I'll assume it is **"FIT21"** and correct it to "FIT21" or "the Fintech Act". "Genius Tech" is very close to "Fintech". "cavity Act" is "Crypto Act". "The Fintech and Crypto Act". I'll use **"FIT21"**. One more check on "dao for traffi". "DAO for trade finance". "Traffi" -> "Trade Finance". One more check on "Bush week". "Blockchain week". One more check on "ganabarance". "JPMorgan". One more check on "Stratum Card King". Bob is from EEA. The text says "Stratum Card King". Maybe "Stratosphere"? "Strato"? I'll use "Strato". Okay, ready to format. Note on "Genius Tech" - Actually, on July 15, 2024, Trump spoke at Bitcoin Conference. "Genius Tech" -> **"Jerome Powell"**? No. **"Trump"**? "Genius Tech" -> **"Trump"**? No. I will leave "Genius Tech" but correct to "The Fintech Act" if I'm sure. "Genius" -> "Genius". "Tech". Maybe "President Trump"? I'll use **"legislation"** to be safe. "Legislation was signed July 15...". Actually, FIT21 passed May 21. Maybe **"PayPal"**? I'll use **"legislation"**. Wait, "Red 1 Meslan". Could it be **"Rémy"**? I'll use **"Red 1 Meslan"**. Final check on length. The input is long. My output must be long. I will not summarize. Word count check: Input ~3300 words. Output should be ~3000-3600 words. I will ensure I don't cut corners. One last thing: "Bobson Wilson" -> **Bob Summerwill**. "James Lubin" -> **Kieren James-Lubin**. "Strato Mercado" -> **Strato**. "Black Ops" -> **BlockApps**. "Blackouts" -> **BlockApps**. Okay.

**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:**
What are you using? I use Restream. We try to use something and stream on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

**[00:10] SPEAKER_01:**
So we're using Streamyard too. We're using Streamyard and I'm just double checking.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_02:**
We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit...

**[00:24] SPEAKER_03:**
None of them are perfect.

**[00:25] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, yeah, that. I'll share the one. I don't know if you should try this one, but this one looks pretty. Pretty cool, pretty great.

**[00:30] SPEAKER_02:**
Because you're thinking there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Like isn't there just an answer that just works.

**[00:39] SPEAKER_02:**
Why would you want to download it? they're not built with interoperability in mind.

**[00:43] SPEAKER_03:**
They don't like it.

**[00:44] SPEAKER_02:**
They want to tap you in.

**[00:45] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, exactly. That's against our vision, you know.

**[00:50] SPEAKER_02:**
X there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio.

**[00:54] SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, it's.

**[00:56] SPEAKER_02:**
Why would you want to download it?

**[00:57] SPEAKER_00:**
You know, like that's something, you know, I guess the next step in maybe.

**[01:00] SPEAKER_02:**
Like you want to use it somewhere else.

**[01:03] SPEAKER_00:**
Are you seeing somebody else be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms, even own a query or just access, you know. Something I love about Google is like I can go. I can activate, you know, like the tracking, you know, but at least I can go and say, what. What did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store, it was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the thing they have like thousands of data, but like they don't even share it with you.

**[01:31] SPEAKER_01:**
We are live. So we're live. No, no, i'm ready. No, but that was a good cold intro. Right, so we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for diff... For a change, are live in real life, in the same room. In the same room.

**[01:33] SPEAKER_00:**
I find it quite, quite well.

**[01:38] SPEAKER_03:**

**[01:40] SPEAKER_01:**
We are live. So we're live. No, no, I'm ready. No, but that was a good cold intro. Right, so we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for diff. For change. Our life in real life, in the same room. In the same room.

**[01:58] SPEAKER_02:**
