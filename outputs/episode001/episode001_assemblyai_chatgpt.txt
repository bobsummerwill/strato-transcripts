SPEAKER_00: Alright, so we’re on. Thanks. My name is Kieren James-Lubin. I’m joined by Jim, or James, from OzDR, and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called BlockApps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that’s not what we’re here to talk about today. We’re taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we’ve all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that it has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened, and so we wanted to kind of get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity, and here we are. With that said, I’ll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we’re not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is the first of a Kieren-produced podcast of sorts. I’ve been on a bunch of them. I don’t think I’ve ever led one. So we’re going to find out how it goes. Alright, so let’s start out with the question: when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I’ll give my answer to start, and there’s still a kicking-myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I’m going to say 2010, possibly 2011. This would have been my senior year in undergrad, of Bitcoin. I distinctly remember it being $3, down from a recent peak of $14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn’t really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then, I probably couldn’t have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal-type provider, that sort of thing. And I might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. With that said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

SPEAKER_01: “Aware” is different than “interested.” I came from an academic background, so I’d been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But I was a little bit too above all that, like, “Oh, that’s a money thing. I’m not interested in that money world.” So really, no. The interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who is an old friend of mine, and that Kieren had been following his blog. Steve called me up and he’s like, “This guy Kieren just called me up and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing.” At first I was like, “Yeah, I’m not interested in all this fake money thing.” And I went and I read the white paper, and by the end of the white paper, I was hooked. I was like, “This isn’t just about banking or something. This is about incentivization on the internet.” And that drew me in. At that point there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that’s when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how that—at the time it was a testnet—and that’s when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled in there. So, I don’t know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, let’s—Jim, we’ll pick that up. I’m trying to stay a little bit chronological. So I was 2010, 2011; sounds like same time frame for you. I think we’ll pull back in a question or two right to that era and we’ll talk in more detail, but let’s hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you want to take it?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I felt really disconnected from North America. So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. One of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWiT that was all technical podcasts. And one of the podcasts I really loved was Security Now, which went really deep into these security technical kinds of things, and did a couple episodes on Bitcoin. I was really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle. Even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it. Didn’t get any Bitcoin—or if I did, I didn’t notice it. I wish. I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this. But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups there’d be groups of computers in part of their office. I was like, “What are those for?” They’re like, “Oh, we’re mining Bitcoin.” And I was like, “Oh, why are you mining Bitcoin?” And they’re like, “Oh, well, we can transfer money and it’s basically free internet magic money.” And I honestly was kind of repelled by that. That seemed too nutty even for me at the time.

SPEAKER_01: Did we all hate it before we liked it?

SPEAKER_00: I never hated it. I was sort of just not that interested, I guess. I think from the East Coast the attitude toward stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think Jimmy had long since been out in California doing—yeah—after your physics days.

SPEAKER_01: You’re not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of—like—I guess I didn’t hate it. I just felt I was too good for it.

SPEAKER_00: I see.

SPEAKER_02: I didn’t hate it, but I think I found the technical aspect fascinating, like I said. It got me to read the white paper and even download the software. But the part that kind of turned me off was when you talk to some of the early people I would ask—who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs—they were kind of fanatical. There was that crypto-anarchist flavor to the early days that turned me off, I would say.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it. But yeah, it was too fringe to attract the classically most successful, in some sense, people at that time. Whereas you’re sort of fighting for jobs in math or physics or something, it’s like the most horsepower wins from an intellectual perspective, and I guess the hardest-working horsepower. Very few of those people got interested in crypto/blockchain. A few cryptographers certainly did, and probably actually more established ones compared to younger ones, like folks like Dan Boneh, etc. But yeah, I don’t know that it was that I was too good for it, but I didn’t grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn’t see anyone near me leaning into it for a while.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I would describe my view of it in the early days as sketchy because most of the use cases—like, I thought the technology was fascinating. But whenever I would ask about—I'm a product guy, so I would always ask—“What’s the use case? Why would you use it?” People would describe things to circumvent existing laws. Like the big one in China I remember is, “Oh, I can transfer money and bypass foreign exchange rules,” and I was like, “Is that legal?” And no one would mention anything afterwards, basically.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Jim, I would say the people in academia—yeah. Well, I want to say good—

SPEAKER_01: I got over feeling too good for it, I’ll tell you that.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we all did. I want to touch on the other big thing that sticks out of my memory from the early blockchain era. We’ve kind of gone through this cycle a couple times: Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox was that first big price run-up. I believe Bitcoin went from like $30 to $1,200 in a pretty short time frame. And as we’ve seen in the last couple crypto—you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person to some extent—consumer interest tracks with the price and people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top. Whether it’s outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone’s hurt on the other side. Crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound, but I guess the question is: do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone—lots of people I knew who were not quite crypto-savvy in the industry, etc.—were suddenly paying attention when Mt. Gox was happening.

SPEAKER_01: I was just getting into things. What year was it? Was it 2015? 2014? 2014, probably, right?

SPEAKER_00: I think Gox was 2013. Let me check.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.

SPEAKER_01: 2013.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Okay, so that was a little before, but that was still the topic everybody was talking about at the time. I was new enough to it that I was observing it as a third party. It was interesting to me. But yeah, I spent a little time to understand what—because the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it. They didn’t explain what was going on. So I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with blockchain. It was—

SPEAKER_00: I think you’re right. So the run-up was actually end of 2013 into the beginning of 2014, it looks like. Okay. So it officially shuttered February 2014 though. And the $1,200 that I remember was November 2013, it looks like.

SPEAKER_02: When did the hack happen?

SPEAKER_00: December. Oh, I think right here.

SPEAKER_02: Okay. Okay. Yeah, right there. Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: So yeah, interesting times for sure.

SPEAKER_02: I think Mt. Gox and—oh, I’m blanking right now—what was the name of that dark web marketplace that used—Silk Road? Silk Road. I think those were kind of intertwined in those early days, right? So I remember even going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about. And I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there. Lots of illicit stuff was listed there.

SPEAKER_00: You know, that’s—

SPEAKER_02: Wow.

SPEAKER_00: I never actually navigated to Silk Road. Just heard about it. I did have to make a Mt. Gox account and some others. There was a period where Dwolla was doing crypto stuff and then I think they stopped, and I believe they’re still around as a payment API company. But yeah, because I definitely used them and some others.

SPEAKER_02: I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt. Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other. And that was the first kind of iteration of “Oh, all crypto and blockchain is dead now,” and then it just keeps coming back, right?

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it sure does. Okay.

SPEAKER_01: There’s a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. If there’s fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. And if there’s fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that we need a little more regulation or something, but that that was a bad person. So it’s always much more tied into—you know, the price of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens. But you don’t see the crashing because somebody commits fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess if the fraud’s big enough. But.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I agree. Segueing quickly: can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first. And then we can do the whole “how we all—”.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Jim—do I want to start or do you want to start?

SPEAKER_01: I’ll start. Back in the 90s, I was in academia, and in the aughts I was in the startup world. I’d done a couple startups, and I was ending one of my startups. I had two sons who were in our local school in California, which was a Mandarin immersion school. At this time, there was just a coincidence: both my wife and I had ended jobs and we said, “Hey, let’s do something crazy right now and let’s take this to its extension. Let’s go to China and actually put them in a school there.” So I called around various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor’s in Beijing. And he says, “I’m going to get you in touch with these guys.” So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now and you can explain.

SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah. The VC—who we’re still friends with—he came up to me and he explicitly said, “I have this brilliant CTO and he says he wants to come to China. I’m not sure how serious he is, so don’t put all your eggs in this basket.” But then we started talking that summer, and you weren’t traveling the country, so you were in a different place every time.

SPEAKER_01: Another advantage of us both being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving.

SPEAKER_02: Around the country. I remember we were kind of talking over the summer and I was seeing how serious you were about coming. And at one point you said, “Okay, look: if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing.” And I went to the school that my kids went to and said, “Can you make space for two foreign kids in this international program?” They said yes, but the kids have to be here the first day of school. And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation. So I called Jim up and said, “Look, I can do it. I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day.” And to my shock, he actually said yes. And he packed up his house.

SPEAKER_01: And everything in the house in, like, I think we had 12 days to be in school, and we probably had to have the house packed within less than a week. That was a crazy week. But Victor was a great help. We were going to a country we’d never been to before, didn’t know much about. Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had scoped out everything. He knew where the good schools were, he knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously. So yeah, it was a great experience.

SPEAKER_02: It was an exciting time to be in China. It was right around the first Olympics, the Beijing Olympics. So it was a really exciting time. You wound up staying for about 18 months, right? In total. A little less.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was over a year.

SPEAKER_02: And then we just kept in touch from there. We loved working together.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it was a great year. What was this, roughly? Times, your period?

SPEAKER_01: Who are you asking? Because it was different.

SPEAKER_00: You, Jim.

SPEAKER_01: Oh, 2011. Summer, we’re driving all over the country. 2011, September, August—I can’t remember. We were in Beijing.

SPEAKER_00: Gotcha. Very cool. And so then you’re back end of 2012 or early 2013, something like that.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we were back in the country in 2013.

SPEAKER_00: Gotcha.

SPEAKER_01: But like January.

SPEAKER_00: Let me segue. I’m trying to keep it slightly chronological to keep everything in my mind consistent. I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but basically—

SPEAKER_02: The—

SPEAKER_00: I had passed my qualifying exam, I’m going to say spring 2014—maybe April or May 2014. For those who are not aware of how a PhD program works: a qualifying exam is like one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis. Sometimes it’s a coursework requirement. Sometimes you need to translate an academic work from one language to another to show proficiency. I think most have dropped those requirements at this point. So it’s a whole bunch of study, tense prep. At Berkeley it’s a three-hour oral exam with a couple people from your department and one from an external department. And then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass, thankfully. Everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good, right? And while I passed it, I didn’t feel great, at least the rest of that day.

SPEAKER_02: When did you find out the result? Immediately?

SPEAKER_00: They put you in the hall and they tell you. Yeah, okay. So you’re just very nervous.

SPEAKER_01: I don’t know what it was like for you, but for me it was like three guys I knew and I was nervous too, but it wasn’t like they had to go calculate numbers or something. They just kind of come out and they’re like, “Yeah, yeah.”

SPEAKER_00: No, it was like that. It’s oral, it’s subjective in a sense, but you’ve got several of the world’s foremost experts in some subjects, so they’re able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research. So anyway, the qualifying exam led to—I needed a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics, and I had almost taken a job working for a data science company that was taking—having to do with Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks. I can’t quite remember at this time, but it seemed like an okay thing. I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I’m from New York, and as with many New Yorkers it took some time to adapt to the California culture and I didn’t fully do it. I’m still prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kind of like it there. By the way, yes, Jim’s there. I’m in the state of New York at the moment.

SPEAKER_02: But—

SPEAKER_00: But yeah, I needed a little break. And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project. Somehow my dad, Joe Lubin, got attached to the project because he was always tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time. He had a CS background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years. So he was always watching technological innovations in financial services, and I guess always had a little bit of the blockchain philosophical character: pro-freedom, a little bit of a libertarian streak, that kind of thing. I believe he happened to be visiting our family—he’s from Toronto; there are a lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. And he went, I believe, to—it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup. This would have been January or February 2014, I believe. Vitalik was speaking there. And like everyone around that time where you see Vitalik speak about something, you get really excited, right? He got ready to start helping out the project right away. He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project. It didn’t turn out that way—we can go into it later—but he started working on it again, let’s say February/March 2014. So he sent me the white paper right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam. I got a chance to read it and it was pretty cool and interesting and new. That was the first time I grasped the potential of the technology, and it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etc. It was exciting enough to work on for that summer. So that’s how I got into it. Subsequently Jim alluded to this earlier: I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Hsu, a great friend of ours—definitely brilliant, somewhat famous, super cool guy. I’d been a long-time reader of Steve’s blog. He’s one of the few really excellent general communicators who’s a super technical guy. Most people who are really technical have a hard time distilling it for a mass-market audience, but Steve is good at that, with nuanced coverage of technical topics. So anyway, I caught up with Steve, and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim. I believe the first time I spoke to Steve I was in New York but was just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe June/July 2014, and maybe I came back in August. It turned out Jim was there in Hayward and we got to meet up. What do you think—August 2014, September, something like that?

SPEAKER_01: Oh, it was around then because, ironically, I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back.

SPEAKER_02: That’s all your big life changes are related to some cross-country trip.

SPEAKER_00: Soul searching. You do a literal search around the country.

SPEAKER_01: Well, I was in Montana and then I was back in the Bay Area and then we talked.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Okay. How was Montana, by the way?

SPEAKER_01: Wow.

SPEAKER_00: Maybe we shouldn’t go there. Montana—oddly crypto-friendly.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, makes sense. Big Sky Country, right?

SPEAKER_00: Okay. I have a couple other 2014 anecdotes that you guys may not even know that much about, but maybe we should jump ahead to 2015 and go back.

SPEAKER_02: Just before we go past 2014: I moved back from China in 2014. And me and Jim were talking about, now that I was back, what kind of project could we do together? So while you had started that conversation, me and Jim were thinking about, okay, maybe we could work on a startup together. At some point you forwarded me the paper as well. So that’s kind of how I got into it as well.

SPEAKER_00: I want to give—yeah, I don’t want to speak the whole time—but I have some info here that I forget if I told you guys at length. In 2014, I did work on the Ethereum project through a bunch of 2014. As far as tech projects go, it was much more global, a little more European, but you had Canada, a bunch of people in Zug, Switzerland, a little bit in Israel. In the early days we worked out of an office—my dad and I and a guy named Stephen Nureyev, who is now kind of famous actually if you Google the name; it’s definitely an interesting and colorful story that I’ll go into a little bit—and a guy named Jonathan, whose last name I couldn’t find when I was writing this down, but Jonathan’s a good guy. I don’t know if they parted ways at some point or how that all happened. So we’re working in this office in Times Square and really trying to find different ways to advance the project, meeting with lots of people. That’s when I met Steve Hsu, who introduced me to Jim, basically just calling up whoever might be interested. But part of the plans that the Ethereum folks had was they acknowledged that there would be a need for ongoing pure research, and then in addition to more focused R&D to build the network out. Vitalik at some point penned an article about “ten hard problems in cryptocurrency” or something of that nature. If we went back now, it would look both very insightful and a little bit dated. I’m sure some have been solved and some may not need to be solved because something else emerged. But basically he foresaw the need for privacy above and beyond pseudonymity; many things with the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, or just energy-efficient blockchains which people were talking about at that time. My position in academia at that time seemed to be helpful as the blockchain people were just so different from the academia people. Despite both groups being really smart, blockchain people were not worried about doing things through the proper channels and approval and writing it up the right way. Whereas something about academia makes you fearful of being wrong because if you’re wrong enough in public there are consequences. And the tech attitude in general is getting something out there—get it to work, but get it out—and then iterate. Blockchain people had that in an extreme. And Ethereum was much more like that than the Bitcoin culture. The Bitcoin culture was like a bunch of practicing-but-academic cryptographers who never wanted to change anything. The Ethereum people were more like the software/computer science/engineering attitude of “Let’s get it out there, let’s tinker with it, let’s see what happens.” There are good arguments for both, especially when you’re talking about a system that records a lot of high-value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred. But all that is to say: it was useful for the Ethereum Foundation to have someone actively in academia to coordinate. So we agreed to work on a body called the Cryptocurrency Research Group, composed of myself, Vitalik, and our friend Aaron Wright. He’s since gone on to a number of Web3 projects, but at the time was a practicing attorney, but also a professor at Cardozo Law School. He came to that Times Square office—which was not the greatest office, I would say—and really leaned in on Ethereum and helped structure everything so that it would be robust, not just technologically, but also how things were set up. They did a quite good job in figuring out how to set things up that other projects since did not do as good a job, I’ll say. Funny times. In 2014, I also got to go to Zug. For those who don’t know, the Ethereum Foundation was one of the first to be headquartered in Switzerland, and it’s become a popular choice for crypto foundations because the Ethereum Foundation blazed a path. Funny thing about Switzerland is that the local authorities also just seem like business people. They want to land the future tax revenue and employment. Switzerland is split into cantons, like states, a little smaller than US states. You can go from canton to canton and try to get the best offer. “Offer” means tax treatment, any grants, or helping get fast answers around legal questions. One of the tough things about the US is that sometimes you don’t know what’s allowed. In Switzerland, they were fairly clear about what they wanted for special tax treatment, etc. So we went out and visited Zug, mid/late summer 2014. I got to meet all of the founders of Ethereum at that time. I believe there were eight in total.

SPEAKER_02: So—

SPEAKER_00: So those numbers changed over time.

SPEAKER_01: Numbers changed over time, though.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, those numbers changed, yes. Vitalik would go around the world and evangelize, get people excited, and they’d want to work with the project. A bunch of folks got attached to it. It worked, but if he were to do it again, I bet he’d be more careful about adding folks, because eight is too many. If you went to a US venture capitalist with a slide that says eight co-founders and they’re not all currently running billion-dollar companies, you’d be laughed out of the room. Yet it worked. The way it broke apart was there were technical folks and business folks. It didn’t really have a nominal CEO at any time, but it was closest to being Charles Hoskinson. At the time I went to Zug, the leadership looked like: on the business side, Charles as CEO; Amir Chetrit doing business development; Joe, my dad; and Anthony Di Iorio as other business guys who probably had the most operating experience. The tech side was Vitalik, Jeff Wilcke, Gavin Wood, and then Mihai Alisie had done corporate setup. I believe Mihai worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin Magazine. Vitalik was a very interesting character: most technical geniuses are not good communicators, and he was a journalist running Bitcoin Magazine, writing many of the articles. I think he crowdfunded the articles a little bit: “If I can get a pledge of one Bitcoin, I’ll write an article about X.” At the time Bitcoin was inexpensive, but those values went up, and I think it ended up being a good funding mechanism. It led him to a thought-leader position in addition to his strong technical ability and the ideas he was generating. He had joined a bunch of projects early on and helped work with them. Like Mastercoin was maybe the first “colored coin” project; he did some work on that. Anyway, those were the eight at the time, and there was a meeting to get everyone on the same page. It was remote, there was Slack, people were working a little bit at cross purposes, lots of infighting. People were stressed. They were trying to deliver on this awesome concept Vitalik put out there. And everyone tried to grab ownership. Like: is there a reason to have all these different clients? In the end, empirically, it worked, but a little bit of it was an “I want Ethereum to be mine” kind of thing. I saw this in the room in Zug. On this trip, everyone went outside at some point, and people were a little bit sick of each other. The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing to some extent. There’s tension early in a company where tech people are like, “What do I need you business guy for? We’re going to make this thing.” And the business people have to raise the money, find sales, partnerships, etc. It’s subjective stuff that the tech people don’t always like or understand. People were uncomfortable with promises Charles was making and accusations—I don’t really know what was going on at that time. But there was a general sense of frustration with him. He also seemed to be executing a smart business strategy but maybe overpromising what’s possible. And Amir was a target because I think people thought he wasn’t doing enough. So they were both jettisoned from the project in Zug. They were out on the terrace; it was like they rented a nice loft as the Ethereum dev house. I’m watching this happen and it was crazy. Then they instated two more co-founders right then who jumped on board and helped out. Otherwise it was a fun and crazy trip. We went out in Zürich, some people got in trouble with the cops—I won’t add more detail—but Zürich’s funny: in the US we’re not used to people drinking on the street; in Zürich everyone drinks on the street and fewer people are in the bars. Strange experience. We went on hikes. Switzerland’s a very nice part of the world, but plenty of drama. I remember having a funny conversation with Mihai about swarm behavior. He learned I had a mathematical background, and we talked about the mathematics of swarms. But it felt nascent, intense, and disorganized. They were grappling with the decision: initially they wanted a nonprofit protocol and a for-profit—they called it a “crypto Google” at the time—to monetize the nonprofit protocol. Plenty of blockchain companies have done that subsequently. But it was decided at that meeting they would be all not-for-profit. People didn’t like it. Folks started talking about brain drain. Some liked it, some didn’t. Sort of the threat being, “If you don’t do this for-profit, I’m going to leave.” I think everyone went off and started their own businesses. It is what it is. Anyway, let me pause. Did I tell this whole story to you guys at any point?

SPEAKER_02: I think you told parts of it and not the entire thing. I didn’t realize the Game of Thrones aspect happened in that short period of time. I knew it had happened behind the scenes.

SPEAKER_00: I think it was going on continually, but it came to a head in that meeting. Funny memory: we met with Bitcoin Suisse—getting off the ground at the time—and we met with a guy named Nicholas, who maybe was CEO or a founder. If you Google it, it says founder and there’s a different CEO now. He made a funny comment. We were in an elevator, one of the hand-operated ones where you do it yourself and the door could easily close on you. I was like, “Wow, we’d never have this in the US because we’re so litigious.” And he said, “Well, Swiss attitude: natural selection.”

SPEAKER_01: I think things get grandfathered in. Some of those subway platforms in New York are pretty terrifying too.

SPEAKER_00: They are. It could be that it’s older there.

SPEAKER_01: Right.

SPEAKER_00: That makes sense. Other than Zug, what we saw was growing momentum around the project. Lots of people all over the world working on it. Stuff probably wasn’t tightly papered. There were no employment agreements. But there was intense excitement and belief everyone would be mega successful one way or another. Jim, do you want to talk about getting into it? I alluded to all the different Ethereum clients and the reason there was more than one. Do you want to tell your report of that part now?

SPEAKER_01: When you were doing all that stuff, I was too busy driving around the country. But I came back at the end of the summer. I got fascinated with the technology. When I read the white paper, that’s when I realized this was something big. I wanted to immerse myself into the world a little bit, but it was a foreign culture to me. Natasha, my wife, and I decided to see what this world was like. We’d try buying a little Bitcoin. We looked at various ways to do it. The way we decided on was to meet someone in a coffee shop in the middle of Berkeley. We got there and he was totally the stereotype. The dude was walking around with the five-toed shoes. It all felt very salacious. We walked in with this packet of money in our hands and we had to meet this guy, and he spent most of the time railing against the government and how much he hated the US government and all the terrible things they were doing. And we kind of transferred the envelope over to him and then we pulled up a computer or our phones and we were watching for six blocks to come by. Finally it went through and we were finally Bitcoin owners.

SPEAKER_00: Do you remember—did you use LocalBitcoins? That was popular. I don’t know if it’s still in existence. LocalBitcoins? Okay, gotcha.

SPEAKER_01: I think we did wait for the six. Maybe after three, he said, “You’re welcome to stay here if you want, but I find that after three it probably won’t revert,” or something. I remember what it was: we went out and sat in the car for another 30 minutes just in case we had to run back in again.

SPEAKER_02: So—

SPEAKER_00: That’s really funny.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. That was our introduction into Bitcoin. And around this time, you and I started hanging out a lot. We were meeting regularly and I had started working on the Haskell client and I brought you in on that. We’d have these coding sessions at your place.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Okay, so that’s fall 2014, right, when we started coding.

SPEAKER_01: I was sort of laughing when you were talking about the overpromising. I was immediately fascinated by Ethereum, but I also remember trying to understand what it was at the beginning. Some of the material out there was great, but some of it was vague and overbroad. I’d go to these YouTube videos and people would be like, “Ethereum is a new way of life. It’s going to take over as a second internet. We’re going to rebuild the internet from beginning to end.” I was like, “What are they talking about?” So the only way I was going to really understand this stuff was to literally start writing code. You can’t hide what’s happening once you have code. I talked about the white paper, but Gavin Wood had put out a Yellow Paper at the same time which talked about the technical details of the innards. So I started looking through that and implementing that in my favorite language, Haskell, and bit by bit putting the whole EVM in Haskell code. That’s what most of the end of the year was like. Until I think in December I was—from the East Coast myself—and we flew out to New York and I met—you introduced me. You were there too. You introduced me to Joe Lubin. And actually, I think before that too, you had set up phone calls where I talked to Vitalik and Joe directly too. So more and more, with the fact that we had a working client and we were following closely all the changes in the testnet era before things were solidified, we got pulled more and more into that world.

SPEAKER_00: Sorry, we’ve been assuming an expert audience. Can you define the term “client” for everybody?

SPEAKER_01: Oh. It’s the software that a blockchain runs on. Usual software: if I run a video game, I just get a computer and put the software on it. That’s my running project. In a blockchain, it’s a distributed thing. So you have to create a piece of software that can be run from anywhere in the world on multiple computers simultaneously. So you’re building sort of a world computer of chained nodes, they call them. We were building one of these nodes that could connect to the existing testnet at the time.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, gotcha. Perfect. I want to talk quickly about some other things from that summer. You guys participated in the crowdsale, did you not? That’s why you bought the Bitcoin the first time?

SPEAKER_02: From our—

SPEAKER_00: Side, we ended up—mostly my dad, but with help from the Ethereum people—coding up a site to do the crowdsale. Ethereum was one of the first to pioneer a pre-funding event where they sold the token Ether in exchange for Bitcoin to users. Essentially an ICO; there was no name for it then. The price varied a little bit over the course of the sale, but it was like one Bitcoin to 2,000 Ether, which meant you made pretty good returns if you participated and sold at the right time—or still holding. The way it worked was complicated. Bitcoin made ICOs hard; Ethereum made them easy later. The Ethereum Foundation had to set up an address for you to send the Bitcoin to so they could mint the Ether in the genesis block for you. But the Foundation did not want to hold everybody’s keys, right? So you had to generate your own keys and the website did this and you’d download them. There were huge warnings: you must download this file; if you lose it, you lose access to your funds. They generated addresses—I can’t quite remember if it was unique per purchase or just the Exodus address. But we were basically the help desk. People would try to purchase Ether and it wouldn’t work. There were interesting goings-on: a fake Twitter account emerged with the E and the U in “Ethereum” transposed. It looked just like Ethereum. They assembled 25,000 followers—no doubt bots—and were offering special deals on Ether. That’s been going on for 10 years now. I’ve heard new crypto projects: when they get popular, people start selling their tokens over Twitter even before those tokens are issued now. So it’s gotten more sophisticated. I remember reaching out to a friend of mine working at Twitter at the time and escalating the ticket because big theft could occur. I believe Jonathan configured one of the block explorers—maybe blockchain.info, I can’t remember—so that every time money hit a certain address, a noise would play. We were in this room all day because we were in help desk mode, and we’d just hear the notifications come in. There was a schedule: over 14 days you could fund with no price change, and then the price started to go up over the course of, I believe, a 42-day sale. All in all, I think 7,000 unique purchasers, something like that. It was quite an affair. It’s more streamlined now. To clear the way, they got a legal opinion from a reputable law firm that they were selling software in essence. Some of that made it to the terms and conditions. Big rush to get it all done. They raised—I don’t even remember—$22 million at the time.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I thought it was in Bitcoin, so I remember it being around $20 million. I remember vaguely it was the biggest crowdfunding event ever or something.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I believe that’s right. It’s either one or two ever at that time and it’s since been surpassed by tons, many of which were done poorly. Interestingly, in the course of the sale, the price of Bitcoin started to go down. I believe it was 600 or so at the start, and we noticed it dropping continually. Maybe by the end it was high fours, low fives. It foreshadowed: it would go on to drop from there. Did you guys remember the experience of the funding site and all that?

SPEAKER_01: I remember the site. I remember a clock on it, but I don’t remember too much else.

SPEAKER_00: Okay. The crowdsale isn’t a huge part of your memory. It’s huge for me because we were dealing with the issues. Vic, you were just getting interested at this time, right?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Jim was going to buy this Bitcoin to participate in the crowdsale and he said, “Do you want to participate?” And I was like, “I’m going to feel like a real idiot if I don’t do anything.” So I did some nominal amount. Of course it’s probably turned into the best investment I ever made. But it was mind-bogglingly complicated. We pooled our resources because it was so hard.

SPEAKER_00: It wasn’t easy. You’re generating keys and all that.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: And I think the biggest problem was getting actual Bitcoin.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Jim was in the Bay Area, so all that stuff. I was in Vancouver and Vancouver was an early Bitcoin adopter, but it was still really hard to find anyone willing to sell you Bitcoin.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that’s interesting. So the sale happens and now the project is funded—really funded. Big VC investments existed at that time, but the bubble years 2020/2021 were unheard of. Series A investments were still between $3 and $10 million. Salaries lower. Back then this was a lot of money. The Ethereum folks kicked in all of their technical dreams. Not just the proliferation of clients. They were going to make a browser: the Mist browser. They were going to make a peer-to-peer messaging system called Whisper. They were going to make a decentralized file storage system. They chose to make a virtual machine like Java. We thought JavaScript was the better analogy because it won on the internet. Has anyone seen an applet in the last 15 years? But they made multiple languages that would compile to the EVM. There’s some benefit to that. It evolved. Do you have a more specific memory of them making a lot of stuff? Can you get into trying to make something compatible with what they were doing at that time?

SPEAKER_01: Once I found the Yellow Paper, it wasn’t as difficult because that centered me around the blockchain part of it. But earlier marketing material was very confusing because they would talk about a browser, a messaging system, and I think even some talk about replacing TCP/IP or something. I can’t remember. Some of these things came into being, some didn’t. My learning process was first realizing what blockchain was, then digging deeper and being confused because I thought this was going to be a blockchain project, and then they were talking about writing browsers. Then realizing when I saw the Yellow Paper that, yeah, this is the core of what Ethereum is. That other stuff is pipe-dream stuff that may or may not come into being. Once I got into concrete testnet work, I understood what was going on.

SPEAKER_00: Gotcha. It was wild. So now we’re going into January 2015. Vitalik visits the Bay Area a bunch. Do you remember we went to a couple meetups with Vitalik?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: He was super casual. It’s funny because now he’s famous, but in those days we’d hang out with him after meetings and he’d find a couch to sleep on. One time we drove him to somebody that he found a couch to sleep on. Fun, casual times.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I think he won the Thiel Fellowship, so there were beds there. I have a memory of—there was a meetup in the South Bay and you drove him into the city or something. There was a Crypto Castle in SF at that time that we occasionally visited. Vitalik could hang out there. He still seems like he has little need for creature comforts. It was funny times.

SPEAKER_02: Really nice couches nowadays.

SPEAKER_00: Really nice couches. But I can’t remember how he got the idea, but we were talking: a bunch of people would be in the Bay Area late January 2015. I had also, through Steve, through Ben Lorica—great guy, at the time head of data science content for O’Reilly conferences—we booked a conference at Fort Mason. I had a co-host named Lauren Lantz, also running a crypto startup these days, a great guy. Given that conference was on the calendar and we knew a bunch of people would be in the Bay Area, we decided to run a parallel technical conference that week which we named the “Verbose CryptoEconomicon.” I think the term “cryptoeconomics” either was invented or popularized by Vitalik. There’s also Vlad Zamfir—don’t know how to pronounce his last name—who was working a lot with Vitalik on proof-of-stake and other things. He went on to start his own fairly successful crypto project; the name escapes me. Vlad was like, “Cryptoeconomics? Is it crypto or is it economics?” It never really stuck, but that was the theme. We had two academic track days and a business track day, I believe. We had speakers—one of whom spoke at the O’Reilly meeting and also at CryptoEconomicon. The building: we co-hosted with a company called Coinify, which I don’t believe exists anymore. A nice guy named Tom Ding. Tom Ding had good plugins for capital and access with the Chinese government. Vic, do you remember who owned that building?

SPEAKER_02: I think it was some construction conglomerate. I remember walking in going, “What does this have to do with construction?” It didn’t have anything to do with tech at all. That’s the thing I remember most.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So—

SPEAKER_01: I should point out that you guys met each other at this conference too.

SPEAKER_02: We had been having conversations online because you guys would get together and we’d chat sometimes, but we’d never actually met in person until that conference.

SPEAKER_00: It was like a month or two or three in at that time. It was a cast of characters. The O’Reilly conference was a little more shiny, corporate. 300–400 attendees, successful. The CryptoEconomicon was great but kind of crazy. There was a guy whose name is escaping me—smart guy, very tight bike shorts—and he kept raising his hand. I think he had a defense background. IBM had a big speaking slot at the time; they were promoting Ethereum plus some other technologies as key to their IoT stack. I’m trying to remember.

SPEAKER_02: I actually looked this up. The participants—small group, like 20–25. Among that group: Vlad Zamfir was there, Vitalik was there, Gavin Wood was there, Dominic Williams—who went to do Internet Computer—was there, Jae Kwon—who went off to do Cosmos—was there. A bunch of Bitcoin Core devs were there. It was a crazy group. If you looked at the amount of talent, people talk about the PayPal mafia; that was the crypto mafia. Almost everyone in that room went off to do a pretty successful project. I remember being in that room and I was really starting on my journey of learning Ethereum and I was completely baffled. I spent probably 90% of my time on Wikipedia trying to figure out: what does the Byzantine Generals Problem have to do with technology? Why are they talking about this? Or SNARKs: what are STARKs? I remember madly trying to keep up. But being in that room was exciting. It was the first time it totally clicked that what they were trying to do was a new kind of computing platform. It always got overshadowed by the money aspect, but in that room it was different. Everyone was focused on how to build this world computer. The talent level was off the chart.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Vic, you should tell the Robin Hanson story. For context: Robin Hanson is a really smart guy, kind of famous technical economist—George Mason, I think.

SPEAKER_01: Good Twitter follow too. You should follow him.

SPEAKER_02: He invented prediction markets, basically. He’s the father of prediction markets. To be clear, Robin Hanson is way smarter than I’ll ever be. But I was in that conference madly on Wikipedia for three days ahead of O’Reilly.

SPEAKER_01: We ourselves were all pretty new to blockchain, so.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that’s true. People were going really deep into these conceptual things. After those three days was the O’Reilly conference, and at one point they had a lunch where everyone sat around big tables and networked. I remember Robin was one of the panelists on some panel about blockchain. He was asking me what I did and why I was here. We had a conversation and I summarized a few things I learned over the past three days. He basically got on stage and reiterated a bunch of things I told him during lunch. Everyone was like, “How did Robin become a blockchain expert? He’s really on the cutting edge.” But it was just amazing.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it was quite a room. We had another futurist, Steve Omohundro—super smart guy as well. I haven’t spoken to him in a long time. The energy in the air was palpable. It convinced us to start our company, I would say.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. It was like being in two rooms. CryptoEconomicon: new computing platform. O’Reilly: big bankers, Reid Hoffman was there, people talking about money. It was clear they didn’t know what was going on in the other room, that something much bigger was happening. That convinced us we could build a bridge between these two worlds.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I remember that. The big headliners at O’Reilly: Reid Hoffman, Balaji Srinivasan spoke, Bill Janeway, and some others. Okay, I want to shift gears to the client race. At this point I got really into it. I never learned in school enough to be a professional-quality software developer, but I learned enough on the job with Jim. As Jim said, we’d meet up at my Berkeley apartment. First on Telegraph, just north of Ashby, right by the Oakland border. Later at a different one, close to campus, like Bancroft and Telegraph. It was open source. Because lots of people were making their own versions, there was a fight for the definition of it, which was in the end settled by the Yellow Paper. Can you talk about that time where we’re coding really hard and trying to keep pace?

SPEAKER_01: It was fun and frustrating. The Ethereum Foundation was trying pretty hard to put the specs out there, but things were changing faster than the Yellow Paper could keep up. I’d have something connecting and communicating and running the virtual machine, and the next day it completely wouldn’t work. Maybe a few weeks later the Yellow Paper would be updated to explain why. But in the meantime, the only way I could figure stuff out was to get one of the other clients and read how they were getting it to work. There was one point when they added encryption to the connection that essentially changed the protocol completely. I connected—nothing was working anymore. Had to dig in and—

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that repressed memory.

SPEAKER_01: —the—

SPEAKER_00: Mostly Jim figured it out. For the technical audience: they put the equivalent of something like SSL/TLS into the product. They put end-to-end encryption in. There’s a complex handshake, a session gets created between peers, etc. It’s really hard to implement because all the messages you’re getting back are encrypted. You have to get it perfect and then it makes sense. If you don’t, nothing makes sense and you don’t know why.

SPEAKER_01: I was irrationally angry about it. I didn’t care whether it was good or bad for the product, but I was genuinely confused too because you have this open network that anyone can connect to, but you want to encrypt everything. It took me a while to figure out why that happened. I was asking around in various DM services—I don’t remember where—and I—

SPEAKER_02: Found giant Skype threads. I remember at the time there were huge threads. I think we weren’t even using Slack yet. There was tons of—

SPEAKER_00: Slack was just getting popular. Ethereum had a Slack. ConsenSys had a Slack. We can get into the ConsenSys story later. But yeah, we had a Skype thread for some reason because it was the thing people used for a threaded discussion group.

SPEAKER_01: I dug around a while to figure out why encryption had been added. I kept getting answers like, “We want to make sure this information is private.” I was like, “It doesn’t make sense. I can connect anywhere and see this stuff.” Finally found one of the people who implemented it. The idea wasn’t crazy. It had nothing to do with privacy per se. Their thought process was more about identity. Once you join, you want essentially a cert that verified that you are who you say you are. They wanted that there for various extensions they were putting in. Okay, that wasn’t crazy. It was very annoying to spend a week implementing. The other funny thing: there was a distrust in standards. A usual software engineer would get TLS and implement it, or take hash algorithms with a corporate stamp of approval. But they wanted to put things a little bit outside of that because they feared—maybe truthfully—backdoors and all these things. So I had to get a lot of nonstandard glue and paste it together into a TLS-like thing.

SPEAKER_00: I can add: the building blocks were semi-standard. They used the same elliptic curve as Bitcoin for signatures. They didn’t invent hashing algorithms or signing algorithms. But the composition—you have to be careful.

SPEAKER_01: They weren’t inventing encryption. They were taking things that were approved of, but they weren’t taking things that were the standards.

SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Backdoor fear, plus there was also a comment like, “TCP has never been proven to be the backbone of a peer-to-peer network.” BitTorrent uses UDP plus something. There was belief existing protocols were insufficient. Might be right, might also be “we have a lot of money, let’s rebuild everything.”

SPEAKER_01: For instance, the hashing algorithm they chose in the early days: they were calling it SHA-3, but SHA-3 hadn’t been finalized at that point. I went and got the code in the Haskell codebase that did the proposed SHA-3 at that point. One day I went into the C++ client and they started calling it Keccak, and I was like, “What’s going on? Why did they change the algorithm?” But it was still connecting to what I had. I found out later what happened: there had been a last-minute change in SHA-3, and the Ethereum team felt that this was a government backdoor being put in there and they refused to put that change in, so they stuck with the original proposal, which was Keccak. That’s what I had already implemented. But they aren’t technically SHA-3 anymore.

SPEAKER_00: Gotcha. I have a vague memory. Can you talk a little bit about Roman? You were talking to Roman some at this time. Who’s Roman, what was going on? I also remember sync.

SPEAKER_01: I remember sync speed. There were kind of two tiers of software developers in the original testnet. Those who were around from the beginning—that wasn’t me, again driving around the country. That included Python, which was Vitalik’s; C++, and Geth were first-tier. Was there another? I’m trying to remember.

SPEAKER_00: I think those were the three Foundation ones.

SPEAKER_02: Besu was in the original group but then it got pulled out—

SPEAKER_00: Besu came much later. Roman might have worked for the Foundation for a bit.

SPEAKER_01: Roman was a little mysterious to me because I first thought he was part of the Foundation, but then I found out later he came in later. Maybe there was arguing and they weren’t communicating with him. I don’t know. Roman was the Java client. What was Roman’s last name?

SPEAKER_00: Mandeleil? I don’t know how to pronounce it. Something like that.

SPEAKER_01: We can look it up. But Roman and I were the later guys. I did the Haskell client and Roman may or may not have been in the Ethereum Foundation. I was not in the Foundation, but I met with those guys a number of times. Everybody would compete around sync speed. I remember going to meetups and Roman would run up to me: “How long does it take you to sync up to a million blocks in the testnet now?” There was competitiveness around sync speed. It’s important, but there are other things too. Everybody was rushing to get sync speed faster and faster.

SPEAKER_00: The point I wanted to capture: it seemed juvenile but also genius. It focused a lot of technical energy. It made for a better product. They also flooded the testnets with giant blocks of data. People treated it like a spacecraft launch. You had to stress test it because it’s the new world computer. Development was more incremental than Bitcoin, but there was stringent scenario testing. I want to hone in on the shifting launch date. We started working on a company related to this. We got worried because they kept adding more stuff. Do you remember that?

SPEAKER_01: It would have continued except for a bit of unluck that was lucky: Bitcoin crashed at that time and it put the fire under everybody’s feet that they had to get this thing out immediately because their holdings were in Bitcoin. If that hadn’t happened, there wouldn’t have been pressure and they might have kept adding and modifying indefinitely.

SPEAKER_00: I believe the Foundation was paying people denominated in fiat but with Bitcoin—so X thousand euros or USD per month, Bitcoin amount varies. There was discussion in Zug: what if Bitcoin goes to $10,000? We shouldn’t convert it. They were right, but prudent would’ve been diversification. I believe they kept it in Bitcoin and paid out. Bills had to be in euros, Swiss francs, USD. Runway shrank from the ~$22 million. Dev teams ramping up. Redundancy. Three full dev teams for clients, maybe half a team for Python because it was mainly Vitalik. JS clients later, Mist, libraries, tooling. Many technical projects, not much business development. Then price drops and suddenly the launch timeline moved up. I believe they forecasted 2016 and it got moved up to July 2015. We’re sitting there in March like, “You’re telling us 2016—should we be doing this?” and then it moved up. It was good it moved up. Jim, do you remember how you predicted when it would launch?

SPEAKER_01: No, I’m not sure what you’re referring to.

SPEAKER_00: I think you plotted a commit graph—commits by day in the Ethereum repo.

SPEAKER_02: Yes, I remember this.

SPEAKER_01: I don’t remember this, but I don’t doubt I did it.

SPEAKER_00: They slowed down, getting ready. There were many eras: Serenity, Metropolis—epochs where there’d be testing. They intended to stay in testnet for a long time. They credited some testnet-mined Ether at a discount into genesis, like 10% or something. They made it progressively more real. It was fortuitous Bitcoin crashed or we might not have seen it launch.

SPEAKER_02: And you didn’t even mention all the projects. There was a Raspberry Pi client.

SPEAKER_00: I forgot about the Raspberry Pi.

SPEAKER_02: There were so many projects. We were like, “What is going on here?”

SPEAKER_00: There were many languages: Serpent (Python-like), Solidity won, LLL (a Lisp-like one). It let developers do what they always want: build P2P messaging, write compilers. It was like that. Okay, let’s go to right before launch. We started working as part of ConsenSys. It functioned as an incubator for us and other projects.

SPEAKER_01: Brooklyn was awesome too. I’d never been to Williamsburg, Bushwick. ConsenSys was moving locations. I loved coming and hanging out.

SPEAKER_00: ConsenSys got the famous office on Bogart. But first was by the water in Williamsburg.

SPEAKER_02: It was in Greenpoint. I remember getting completely lost and finding it. Williamsburg is great.

SPEAKER_01: I remember sitting there one day and all of a sudden everybody came screaming in. They were filming an episode of Girls outside, so I ran outside and watched them film part of an episode.

SPEAKER_00: Wow. That was—okay, so that’s early March/April?

SPEAKER_02: Around April/May. We moved into the Bogart office just before the launch of Ethereum. One reason was to have enough space for a bigger hackathon.

SPEAKER_00: Right. I remember that. We were frantically building software. Starting to work with people from within ConsenSys. Folks joined the project, some went on to big success. Should we tell the Tim story?

SPEAKER_02: Tim, the founder of Truffle, helped us build our first blockchain explorer. He was a brilliant developer then and still is. Aaron—who went on to build MetaMask—helped us think about the REST API and how it would work.

SPEAKER_00: I met a couple times at my place in Berkeley with Aaron too. Folks would just come by, and now they’re big deals.

SPEAKER_02: Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: I feel like you should tell the hard-hitting version of the Tim story just a little, because it was funny in retrospect.

SPEAKER_02: We were really focused on creating a REST API. I come from a lean startup background. We wanted to push deadlines. At the time people were more exploring. I was ratcheting up pressure to present at some conference or meetup on a particular night. As pressure went up, people were like, “I want to pursue my other interests instead of working in this high-pressure environment.” Early ConsenSys was like that: different working styles. It was amazing the people who did stuff.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Lots of smart people and flow between projects. It was amorphous. Exciting, but hard to get someone “assigned” to your team to do the thing you expected.

SPEAKER_02: There weren’t really team assignments. They were suggested.

SPEAKER_02: People flowed in and out, great for creativity, hard for deadlines because deadlines require long hours and not-fun work.

SPEAKER_00: We looked at precedent like chain.com. “Let’s have an API and make Ethereum easy.” We found resistance. Vic, talk more?

SPEAKER_02: While you guys worked on the client, I was trying to build smart contract applications. Tooling like Mist and front ends and the languages were constantly changing. It was impossible to build an app and share it and get something running quickly. My background was web and mobile startups and the first thing you look for is a REST API. If we’re ever going to get this ecosystem to work, we need that. We got a lot of resistance.

SPEAKER_01: It was like we were speaking Martian. People had no interest in anything that sounded corporate.

SPEAKER_02: It wasn’t even corporate. It was more like—

SPEAKER_00: There was suspicion of servers. I remember the
