Below is **Part 1** of the cleaned transcript (from **[00:00]** through **[25:27]**). I’m keeping **all content**, fixing **names/terms/punctuation**, removing only **excessive** fillers/false starts, and preserving **timestamps exactly**. If you want, I’ll continue with **Part 2** immediately after.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** All right, so we’re on. Thanks. My name is **Kieren James-Lubin**. I’m joined by Jim (or James) Hermosdiar and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called BlockApps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that’s not what we’re here to talk about today. We’re actually taking up the topic of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we’ve all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened. So we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity. And here we are. With that said, I’ll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we’re not trying to be formal here—trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, currently produced podcast of sorts. I’ve been on a bunch of them. I don’t think I’ve ever led one. So we’re going to find out how it goes.

All right. So let’s start out with the question: when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I’ll give my answer to start, and there’s still a kicking-myself aspect to it. I became aware, I’m going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad. I distinctly remember it being three dollars, down from a recent peak of 14 or 15 dollars. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn’t really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then, I probably couldn’t have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal-type provider, that sort of thing. And I might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.

**[02:24] SPEAKER_01:** That said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin? “Aware” is different than, like, interested. I came from an academic background, so I’d been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it, but I was a little bit too above all that—like, “Oh, that’s like a money thing. I’m not interested in that money world.” So really, no. The interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who was an old friend of mine, and Kieren had been following his blog. Steve called me up and he’s like, “This guy Kieren just called me up, and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing.”

At first I was like, “Yeah, I’m not interested in all this fake money thing.” Then I went and I read the white paper. By the end of the white paper, I was hooked. I was like, “This isn’t just about banking or something. This is about incentivization on the internet.” And that drew me in. At that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed that I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that’s when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how they—at the time it was a testnet.

**[03:45] SPEAKER_04:** And that’s when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled in. So, I don’t know—let me pass it on to Victor. Jim will pick that up. I’m trying to stay a little bit chronological. So I was 2010/2011, sounds like the same time frame for you. I think we’ll pull back in a question or two right to that era and we’ll talk in more detail, but let’s hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you want to take it?

**[04:14] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I felt really disconnected from North America. So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. One of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWiT that was like all technical podcasts. And one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast *Security Now*, which went really deep into security technical things. He did a couple episodes on Bitcoin and I was really fascinated by it, mostly from a technical angle. Even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it. Didn’t get any Bitcoin—or if I did, I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this.

But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups there’d be groups of computers in part of their office. And I was like, “What are those for?” And they’re like, “Oh, we’re mining Bitcoin.” And I was like, “Oh—why are you mining Bitcoin?” And they’re like, “Oh, well, we can transfer money, and it’s basically free internet magic money.” And I honestly was kind of repelled by that. That kind of seemed too nutty even for me at the time. Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**[05:44] SPEAKER_04:** I never hated it. I was sort of just not that interested, I guess. From the East Coast, the attitude towards stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think Jimmy had long since been out in California doing—

**[06:04] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. You know, after your physics days, you’re not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of—like, I guess I didn’t hate it. I just felt I was too good for it. But I think I found the—

**[06:21] SPEAKER_00:** Everyone talked about—so I was fascinated by the technical aspect, like I said. It got me to read the white paper and even download the software. But I think the part that kind of turned me off was: when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask—who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs—they were kind of fanatical. There was that crypto-anarchist flavor to the early days that turned me off, I would say.

**[06:52] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it. But yeah, it was too fringe to attract the classically most successful, in some sense, at that time. Whereas, you know, when you’re fighting for jobs in math or physics or something, it’s just like the most horsepower wins from an intellectual perspective—plus the hardest-working horsepower. Very few of those people got interested in crypto/blockchain. A few cryptographers certainly did, and probably actually more established ones, compared to younger ones—folks like Dan Boneh, etc.

But yeah, I don’t know that I was “too good for it,” but: one, I didn’t grasp right away that it was revolutionary; and two, I didn’t see anyone near me leaning into it for a while.

**[08:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I would describe my view of it in the early days as sketchy. Most of the use cases—I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask, you know, I’m a product guy, so I’d ask: “What’s the use case? Why would you use it?” People would describe things to circumvent existing laws. The big one in China that I remember is: “Oh, I can transfer money and bypass foreign exchange rules,” and stuff. And I was like, “Is that legal?” Like—no one would mention anything afterwards, basically.

**[08:42] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I got over feeling too good for it, I’ll tell you that.

**[08:55] SPEAKER_04:** And we all did, yeah. I want to touch on the other big thing that sticks out in my memory from the early blockchain era—and we’ve kind of gone through this cycle a couple of times—was Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox was that first big price run-up. I believe Bitcoin went from like 30 bucks to 1,200 bucks in a pretty short timeframe.

And as we’ve seen in the last couple, you know—crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person—to some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price. People get excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top.

And whether it’s outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone is hurt on the other side. And crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound.

But I guess the question is: do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone—lots of people I knew who were not quite crypto-savvy—were suddenly paying attention when Mt. Gox was happening.

**[10:24] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I was just getting into things. What year was it? Was it 2015? 2014? Probably 2014, right? I think Gox was ’13—let me check. Yeah, okay: ’13. So that was a little before. But that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time.

I was new enough to it that I was observing it as a third party. It was interesting to me, but I spent a little time to understand what—because the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it. They didn’t explain what was going on. So I spent a little time to understand that yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with blockchain. It was—

**[11:12] SPEAKER_04:** I think you’re right. The run-up was actually end of ’13 into the beginning of ’14, it looks like. Okay. So it officially shuttered February 2014. And the 1,200 that I remember was like November 2013, it looks like. When did the hack happen—December? Oh, I think right here—okay, okay, yeah. Right there.

**[11:38] SPEAKER_03:** So, yeah—interesting times for sure.

**[11:41] SPEAKER_00:** Because I think about Mt. Gox and—oh, what was the name of that dark web marketplace that used—

**[11:50] SPEAKER_03:** Silk Road.

**[11:51] SPEAKER_00:** Silk Road, yeah. I think those were kind of intertwined in those early days, right? I remember even going on Silk Road just to check what it was about, and I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there—lots of illicit stuff was listed there.

**[12:12] SPEAKER_04:** Wow. You know, I think I never did that. I never actually navigated to Silk Road—just heard about it. I had a Mt. Gox account, and some others. There was a period where Dwolla was doing crypto stuff, and then I think they stopped. I believe they’re still around as a payment API company. But yeah—because I really used them and some others.

**[12:38] SPEAKER_00:** I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt. Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other. That was sort of the first iteration of: “Oh, you know—all crypto and blockchain is dead now,” and then it just keeps coming back, right?

**[12:59] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, it sure does. There’s a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. Like: if there’s fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means the blockchain is a corrupt place. If there’s fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means we need a little more regulation or something—but that was a bad person. So it’s always much more tied in.

The price of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens, but you don’t see, like, “the dollar crashing” because somebody commits fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess fraud’s big enough—but yeah. I agree. Just a segue.

**[13:50] SPEAKER_04:** John Coleman—segue quickly. Can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole “how we all do.”

**[13:57] SPEAKER_00:** Do I want to start, or do you want to start?

**[14:00] SPEAKER_01:** I’ll start, and I’ll pass it over. Back in the ’90s I was in academia, and in the aughts I was in the startup world. I’d done a couple startups and I was ending one of my startups. I had two sons who were in our local school in California, which was a Mandarin immersion school.

At this time, there was a coincidence: both my wife and I had ended jobs. And we said, “Hey, let’s just be crazy right now. Let’s take this to its extension. Let’s go to China and actually put them in a school there.” So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor’s in Beijing. He says, “I’m going to get you in touch with these guys.” So let me pass it over to you right now and you can—

**[14:58] SPEAKER_00:** Well, yeah. The VC—who we’re still friends with—he kind of came up to me and explicitly said, “I have this brilliant CTO and he says he wants to come to China. I’m not sure how serious he is, so don’t put all your eggs in this basket.”

Then we started talking that summer. You were traveling in the country, so you were in a different place every—another advantage of us both being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country.

I remember we were talking over the summer and I was trying to see how serious you were about coming. And at one point you said, “OK, look—if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing.” I went to the school that my kids went to and said, “Can you make space for two foreign kids?” This international program—they said yes, but the kids have to be here the first day of school. And the first day of school was two weeks from that conversation. So I called him up and said, “Look, I can do it.”

**[16:14] SPEAKER_01:** You know, “I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day.” And to my shock, he actually said yes. He talked to his house and—like everything in the house—in, I think we had 12 days to be in school. We probably had to have the house back within less than a week. So that was a crazy week.

But Victor was a great help. We were going to a country we’d never been to before and didn’t know much about. Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier, so he had scoped out everything. He knew where the good schools were. He knew where the good apartment buildings were. He helped us out tremendously.

It was a great experience and an exciting time to be in China—right around the first Olympics.

**[17:02] SPEAKER_00:** It was right around the Beijing Olympics, so it was a really exciting time. You wound up staying for about 18 months, right? In total?

**[17:26] SPEAKER_01:** A little less, but yeah—it was over a year. What year did you arrive? Rough time?

**[17:56] SPEAKER_04:** Who are you asking?

**[17:26] SPEAKER_01:** Oh—2011. Summer 2011 we’re driving all over the country. 2011 September—August, I can’t remember. We were in Beijing.

**[17:56] SPEAKER_04:** Gotcha. Very cool. So then you’re back end of 2012 or early 2013, something like that?

**[17:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, we were back—when did we come back? I guess we were back in the country in 2013, like January.

**[17:56] SPEAKER_04:** Let me segue. I’ll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep everything in my mind here consistent. So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but basically: I had passed my qualifying exam, I’m going to say spring 2014—maybe April or May 2014.

For those who are not aware of how a PhD program works: the qualifying exam is one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis. Sometimes it’s a coursework requirement. Sometimes you need to translate an academic work from one language to another to show proficiency. I think most programs have dropped those requirements at this point.

At Berkeley it’s a whole bunch of study and tense prep. It’s a three-hour oral exam with a couple of people from your department and one from an external department, and then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass, thankfully. It was—everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good, right? So while I passed it, I didn’t feel great at least the rest of that day.

**[19:38] SPEAKER_01:** When do you find out the result—immediately?

**[19:58] SPEAKER_04:** You do. They put you in the hall and they tell you.

**[19:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, okay, that’s good. So you’re just very nervous. It wasn’t like they had to go and calculate numbers or something. They just kind of come out and they’re like, “Yeah.”

**[19:58] SPEAKER_04:** Exactly. It’s oral. It’s subjective in a sense, but you’ve got several of the world’s foremost experts in some subjects, so they can assess whether you understand it enough to proceed with research.

So anyway: the qualifying exam led to me needing a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics. I had almost taken a job working for a data science company that was taking—something having to do with Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks. I can’t quite remember. But it seemed okay. I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I’m from New York. And as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture, and I didn’t fully do it. I’m prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kind of like it there. Yes—Jim’s there. I’m in the state of New York at the moment.

But yeah: I needed a break. And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project. So somehow—my dad Joe Lubin got attached to the project, basically, because he was tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time. He had a CS background plus a financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years, so he was always watching technological innovations in financial services. He also always had a bit of a blockchain philosophical character in that—pro-freedom, a little bit of a libertarian streak kind of thing.

I believe he happened to be visiting our family—he’s from Toronto. A lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. He went, I believe, to—maybe it was a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup. But this would have been January/February 2014, I believe. Vitalik was speaking there. And like everyone around that time: when you saw Vitalik speak about something, you got really excited. So he got ready to start helping out the project right away. He thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project. It didn’t turn out that way—we can go into it later. But he started working on it again, let’s say February/March 2014.

He sent me the white paper—either right after, maybe right before my qualifying exam. I got a chance to read it. It was pretty cool and interesting and new. That was the first time I grasped the potential of the technology. It caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etc. It was exciting enough to work on for that summer. So that’s how I got into it.

Subsequently—Jim alluded to this earlier—I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Hsu, a great friend of ours. I don’t know—he’s not quite famously brilliant, definitely brilliant, somewhat famous. Super cool guy. I’d been a long-time reader of Steve’s blog. He’s one of the few excellent general communicators who’s super technical but still able to distill things for a mass-market audience—while keeping nuance.

Anyway, I caught up with Steve, and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim. The first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York but just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe June/July 2014. I came back in August or something like that. And it turned out Jim was there in Hayward and we got to meet up.

**[24:58] SPEAKER_01:** What do you really think—August 2014? September? Something like that.

**[25:27] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, around then. Because ironically I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back.

**[24:58] SPEAKER_01:** That’s all your big life changes are related to some cross-country drive. You do a soul-searching—you do a literal search.

**[25:27] SPEAKER_04:** Well, see, I was in Montana, then I was back in the Bay Area, and then we talked.

**[25:27] SPEAKER_04:** How was Montana, by the way?

**[25:27] SPEAKER_01:** Wow—maybe we shouldn’t go—

**[25:27] SPEAKER_04:** Montana, oddly crypto-friendly.

**[25:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Makes sense. Big sky country—that’s my country.

If you confirm, I’ll continue with **Part 2** (starting at **[25:56]**) and keep going until the next natural breakpoint.
