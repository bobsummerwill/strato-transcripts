> Alrighty, so we're on. Thanks. So my name is Kieran James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James from OzDR and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Blockapps which has been in operation for quite some time. But that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened and so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for, for posterity and here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion. But we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, Kieran produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes. Alrighty, so let's, let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad of bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of 14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a paypl type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. So that said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

**Intermediate:**

> Serenity. You know, they were like epochs where like there would be testing of the software and they intended to stay in testnet for quite a long time. That's the upshot. And I think they ended up like crediting some of the testnet mind ether like 1 to 10 again or 10 to 1 against real ether. So 10% of the value for the people who mined on the test. Net. So they made it kind of progressively more real. But really was fortuitous that there was that price crash because we might never have seen it. Might have never seen the light of day. So many of these.

**Intermediate:**

> yeah okay that's good so you're just like very nervous I don't know what it was like for you but for me it was just like three guys I knew and I I was nervous too but it wasn't like they had to go and like uh you know like calculate numbers or something they just kind of come out and they're like yeah yeah yeah exactly it was no it was like that right yeah it's it's a oral it's

**Intermediate:**

> I'm trying to even remember okay I actually looked this up so the the participants like it was a very small group of people like I think 20 25 but in the among that group of people was so yeah Vlad who did proof of stake was there Vitalik was there you know Gavin was there who was working on a theorem but later went on to do polka dot Dominic who went to do you know internet computer was there yeah um i think jay jay kwan jay kwan was there who you know went off to do cosmos like a bunch of bitcoin core devs were there um you know it was it was just a crazy group of people to be like like if you looked at the amount of talent like i know people talk about the paypal mafia that was like the crypto mafia right like it was like everyone who went off you know almost everyone in that room went off to do a pretty successful project and but there was like i remember being in that room and kind of like we'd started talking and i was really starting on my journey about learning about ethereum and i was just completely baffled like i spent probably 90 of the right time on wikipedia like trying to figure out like what does the byzantine generals problem have to do with technology why are they talking about this you know like or or you know like snarks what are starts like you know I remember like look at like trying to madly keep up with these things but it was just being in that room was exciting like you could it was the first time that I ever totally clicked in that what they were trying to do was a new kind of computing platform and that like you know because it always got overshadowed by the financial money crypto aspect of it right but you could in that room it was very different it was just like everyone was really focused on like okay how do we build this world computer right so like um and yeah like I mean the talent level was off the chart in that room like it's just amazing yeah um Vicky should tell the Robin Hanson story

**Intermediate:**

> wow yeah that was so okay so that's earlier it wasn't that March April yeah I think it was April May kind of thing well we moved into the Bogart office um just before the launch of ethereum in fact we we one of the reasons we moved into that office a little bit earlier was so we'd have enough space to do a bigger hackathon right right okay yeah I do remember that um

> so you know uh it is what it is but anyways um let me pause and see if you got did I tell this whole story you know to you guys at any point I I think you told parts of it not the entire thing but yes I I didn't realize the sort of Game of Thrones aspect happened in all of that period short period of time

**Intermediate:**

> well yeah I mean the it was fun and frustrating at the same time because um I think that the Ethereum Foundation was trying pretty hard to put the specs out there but still things were changing faster than like the yellow paper could could keep up to things so I would just uh like have something to the point where it was connecting and communicating and running running the virtual machine And then like next day I'd come in and completely wouldn't work. And maybe, maybe a few weeks later, like the yellow paper would be updated to explain why. But in the meantime, the only way that I could sort of figure stuff out was to just go and get one of the other clients and read how in the world are they getting this thing to work? And there was one point when they added encryption to the connect to the connection that essentially changed the protocol completely. I connected, nothing was working anymore. I had to like just dig in and,
