SPEAKER_04: All righty, so we're on. Thanks. So my name is Karen James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James Hermosdiar and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Block Apps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.

Sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened, and so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity. And here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, current produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes.

All righty. So let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad of Bitcoin, and I distinctly remember it being three dollars down from a recent peak of 14 or 15 dollars.

I thought it was interesting and you know, looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.

SPEAKER_01: That said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin? Aware is different than like interested in fact. I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But I was like a little bit too above all that, like oh that's like a money thing I'm not interested in that money world. So really no, like the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who was an old friend of mine.

And Kiernan had been following his blog. And Steve called me up, and he's like, this guy Kiernan just called me up, and you you have to go look at this Ethereum thing. And so at first I was like uh yeah you know I'm not interested in all this this fake money thing. And I went and I read the white paper. And by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about like a banking or something. This is about incentivization on the internet. And that drew me in.

And at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how they, and at the time it was a test net.

SPEAKER_04: And that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there. So well, I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor. Yeah, let's uh, Jim will pick that up. I'm trying a little bit stay chronological. So I you know, I was 2010, 2011 sounds like same time frame for you. I think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era, and we'll talk in more detail, but let's hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you want to take it?

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I felt really disconnected from North America. So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. One of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWIT that was like all technical podcasts. One of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast Security Now which went really deep into these kind of like security technical kind of things. And he did like a couple episodes of Bitcoin, and I was like really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle.

I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it, didn't get any Bitcoin or if I did, I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this. But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups, there'd be groups of computers in part of their office. And I was like, what are those for? And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin. And I was like, oh, why are you mining Bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, we can transfer money and like it's basically free internet magic money. And I was honestly kind of repelled by that. That kind of seemed like too nutty even for me at the time. Did we all hate it before we liked it?

SPEAKER_04: I never hated it. I was sort of just like not that interested I guess. From the East Coast, the attitude towards stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think Jimmy would long since been out in California doing like...

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you know after your physics days, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like, I guess I didn't hate it, I just felt I was too good for it. But I think I found the like...

SPEAKER_00: Like everyone talked about. So I was fascinated with the technical aspect, as I said. It got me to read the white paper and even download the software. But I think the part that kind of turned me off was when you talk to some of the early people that would ask like who are saying Bitcoin mining rigs. They were kind of fanatical. There was that crypto-anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off I would say.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing, mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it. But yeah, I think it's sort of it was too fringe to attract like the classically most successful in some sense people at that time. Whereas, you know, fighting against not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs like in math or physics or something. It's just like the most horsepower wins from a you know intellectual perspective and I guess the hardest working horsepower very few of those people got interested in crypto blockchain. A few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones as far as you know compared to younger ones like folks like Dan Boneh etc.

But yeah, I think I don't know that I was too good for it, but that one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I would describe my view of it in the early days as sketchy because most of the use cases that I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask about, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask like what's the use case, why would you use it, and people would describe things to circumvent existing laws. The big one in China that I remember is like oh I can transfer money and bypass foreign exchange rules and stuff, and I was like is that legal? Like no one would know...

SPEAKER_01: Mention anything afterwards basically. Yeah, well, I got over feeling too good for it. I'll tell you that yeah, and we all did yeah.

SPEAKER_04: I want to touch on the other, the big thing that sticks out in my memory from the early blockchain era is Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox was that first big price run up. I believe Bitcoin went from like 30 bucks to 1200 bucks in a pretty short timeframe. And as we've seen in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person.

To some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price. And people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top. And whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side. And sort of crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound.

But I guess the question is, do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone, lots of people I knew who were not quite crypto savvy in the industry etc were suddenly paying attention when Mt.

SPEAKER_01: Gox was happening just getting into things. What year was it? Was it 2015, 2014? 2014 probably right? I think Mt. Gox was 13. Let me check yeah, okay, 13. Yeah, okay, so that was a little before but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time. I was new enough to it that it was still I was observing it as a third party. It was interesting to me.

But yeah, I think I spent a little time to understand what because the newspaper coverage like usual was terrible about it. They didn't explain what was going on. So I spent a little time to understand that yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with blockchain. It was oh there's...

SPEAKER_04: I think you're right. So the run up was actually end of 13 into the beginning of 14. It looks like okay, so it officially shuttered February 2014. Though, and the big the 1200 that I remember was like November 2013. It looks like when did the hack happen? December Oh, I think right here. Okay, okay, yeah, right there yeah.

SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, interesting times for sure.

SPEAKER_00: Because I think about Mt. Gox and, oh, what was... I'm blanking right now. What was the name of that dark web marketplace that used...

SPEAKER_03: Silk Road.

SPEAKER_00: Silk Road, yeah. I think those were kind of intertwined in those early days right? So I remember even going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about, and I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there. Lots of illicit stuff was listed there.

SPEAKER_04: That's wow. You know, I think I never did that. I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road. Just heard about it at like I had a Mt. Gox account and some others. There was a period where like Dwala was doing crypto stuff, and then I think they stopped, and I believe they're still around as like a payment API company. But, yeah, because I really use them and some others.

SPEAKER_00: I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt. Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other, and that was like the sort of like, as you mentioned, like the first kind of iteration of like oh you know all crypto and blockchain is dead now, and then it just keeps coming back right?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it sure does. Okay, there's a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. If there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. But if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that it might mean that we need a little more regulation or something, but that was a bad person. So it's always much more tied into the price of Bitcoin that can drop quite a bit when something like this happens, but you don't see like E crashing because somebody commits fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess fraud's big enough, but yeah, I agreed. Just a segue yeah.

SPEAKER_04: John Coleman, SIG way and quickly. Can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole how we all do.

SPEAKER_00: Do I want to start, or do you want to start?
