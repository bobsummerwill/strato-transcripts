**[00:00] SPEAKER_05:** My name is Karen James-Lubin. I’m joined by Jim, or James Hermosdiar, and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Block Apps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that’s not what we’re here to talk about today. We’re actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we’ve all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum, and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened. And so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity. And here we are. So with that said, I’ll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we’re not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, currently produced podcast of sorts. I’ve been on a bunch of them. I don’t think I’ve ever led one. So we’re going to find out how it goes.

All righty. So let’s start out with the question: when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I’ll give my answer to start. And there’s still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I’m going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad, of Bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of $14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn’t really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you ask me then, I probably couldn’t have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And I might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.

**[02:24] SPEAKER_02:** That said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin? “Aware” is different than “interested.” I came from an academic background, so I’d been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it, but I was a little bit too above all that, like, “Oh, that’s like a money thing. I’m not interested in that money world.” So really, no.

The interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who was an old friend of mine, and Kieren had been following his blog. And Steve called me up and he’s like, “This guy Kieren just called me up and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing.” And so at first I was like, “Yeah, I’m not interested in all this fake money thing.” And I went and I read the white paper. And by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in. I was like, this isn’t just about a banking or something. This is about incentivization on the internet. And that drew me in.

And at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed, I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that’s when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how they—at the time it was a testnet—and that’s when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there. So, I don’t know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

**[03:45] SPEAKER_05:** Jim will pick that up. I’m trying to stay a little chronological, so I was 2010, 2011. Sounds like same time frame for you. I think we’ll pull back in a question or two right to that era, and we’ll talk in more detail, but let’s hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you want to take it?

**[04:14] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I felt really disconnected from North America. So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts, and one of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWiT that was like all technical podcasts. And one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast Security Now, which went really deep into these kind of security technical kind of things. And he did a couple episodes of Bitcoin, and I was really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle.

Even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it. Didn’t get any Bitcoin—or if I did, I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this. But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups there’d be groups of computers in part of their office. And I was like, “What are those for?” And they’re like, “Oh, we’re mining Bitcoin.” And I was like, “Oh, why are you mining Bitcoin?” And they’re like, “Oh, well, we can transfer money and it’s basically free internet magic money.” And I was like—I honestly was kind of repelled by that. That kind of seemed like too nutty even for me at the time. Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**[05:44] SPEAKER_05:** I never hated it. I was sort of just not that interested, I guess. You know, I think from the East Coast, the attitude towards stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think Jimmy would long since been out in California doing—

**[06:04] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, you know, after your physics days. You’re not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of—like, I guess I didn’t hate it. I just felt I was too good for it. But I think I found the—

**[06:21] SPEAKER_00:** Everyone talked about it. So I was fascinated by the technical aspect, like I said. It got me to read the white paper and even download the software. But I think the part that kind of turned me off about it was, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, who are seeing Bitcoin mining rigs, they were kind of fanatical. There was that crypto-anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say.

**[06:52] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it. But yeah, I think it was too fringe to attract, in some sense, the classically most successful people at that time.

Whereas, you know, you’re sort of fighting for jobs in math or physics or something. It’s just like the most horsepower wins from an intellectual perspective, and I guess the hardest-working horsepower. Very few of those people got interested in crypto, blockchain. A few cryptographers certainly did, and probably actually more established ones, as far as compared to younger ones—folks like Dan Boneh, etc.

But yeah, I think, I don’t know that I was too good for it. But one, I didn’t grasp right away that it was revolutionary. And I didn’t see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

**[08:13] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I would describe my view of it in the early days as sketchy. Because most of the use cases that—I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask about, you know, I’m a product guy, so I would always ask, like, “What’s the use case? Why would you use it?” And people would describe things to circumvent existing laws.

The big one in China that I remember is like, “Oh, I can transfer money and bypass foreign exchange rules,” and stuff. And I was like, “Is that legal?” And they were like, “No,” and then no one would mention anything afterwards, basically.

**[08:42] SPEAKER_02:** Well, I got over feeling too good for it. I’ll tell you that.

**[08:55] SPEAKER_05:** And we all did, yeah.

I want to touch on the other big thing that sticks out in my memory from the early blockchain era. And we’ve kind of gone through this kind of cycle a couple of times, was Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox was that first big price run-up. I believe Bitcoin went from like 30 bucks to 1200 bucks in a pretty short timeframe. And as we’ve seen in the last couple crypto—you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person. Somebody said consumer interest tracks with the price. And people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top.

And whether it’s outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone’s hurt on the other side. And crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound. But I guess the question is: do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone, lots of people I knew who were not—

**[10:19] SPEAKER_02:** Quite crypto-savvy in the industry, etc., were suddenly paying attention when Mt. Gox was happening, just getting into things. What year was it? Was it 2015? 2014? 2014 probably, right? I think Gox was ’13. Let me check—yeah. Okay, ’13. Yeah. Okay. So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time.

I was new enough to it that it was still—I was observing it as a third party. It was interesting to me. But yeah, I spent a little time to understand what—because the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it. They didn’t explain what was going on. So I spent a little time to understand that yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with blockchain. It was—

**[11:12] SPEAKER_05:** I think you’re right. So the run-up was actually end of ’13 into the beginning of ’14, it looks like. So it officially shuttered February 2014. Though, the big 1200 that I remember was like November 2013, it looks like. When did the hack happen? December. Oh, I think right here—okay, okay, yeah, right there.

**[11:38] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, interesting times for sure. Because I think about Mt. Gox and—oh, what was—I’m blanking right now. What was the name of that dark web marketplace that used—Silk Road. Silk Road, yeah.

I think those were kind of intertwined in those early days, right? So I remember even going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about. And I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there, like lots of illicit stuff was listed there.

**[12:12] SPEAKER_05:** Wow. You know, I think I never did that. I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road. I had a Mt. Gox account, and some others. There was a period where Dwolla was doing crypto stuff, and then I think they stopped. And I believe they’re still around as a payment API company. But yeah, because I definitely used them and some others.

**[12:38] SPEAKER_00:** I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt. Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other. And that was like the first iteration of, “Oh, all crypto and blockchain is dead now,” and then it just keeps coming back, right?

**[12:59] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, it sure does. There’s a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. If there’s fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. And if there’s fraud and it happens in traditional banking, it might mean that we need a little more regulation or something, but that was a bad person. So it’s always much more tied into, you know, that the price of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens. But you don’t see, like, equities crashing because somebody commits fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess fraud’s big enough, but yeah, I agreed.

Just a segue, yeah.

**[13:50] SPEAKER_05:** Segueing quickly: can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole how we all—yeah.

Jim, do I want to start, or do you want to start?

**[14:00] SPEAKER_02:** I’ll start and I’ll pass it over.

Actually, back in the ’90s I was in academia, and in the aughts I was in the startup world. And I’d done a couple startups, and I was ending one of my startups. And I had two sons who were in—our local school in California was a Mandarin immersion school. And at this time, there was just a coincidence: both my wife and I had ended jobs. And we said, “Hey, let’s just be crazy right now. And let’s take this to its extension. Let’s go to China, and actually put them in a school there.”

So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor’s in Beijing. And he says, “I’m gonna get you in touch with these guys.” So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now and you can—

**[14:58] SPEAKER_00:** Well, yeah. And so the VC, who we’re still friends with, he kind of came up to me and he explicitly said, like, “Oh, I have this brilliant CTO and he says he wants to come to China. I’m not sure how serious he is, so don’t put all your eggs in this basket.”

But then we started talking that summer. And you weren’t like traveling in the country, so you were in a different place every—another advantage of us both being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country.

And I remember we were kind of talking over the summer, and I was seeing how serious you were about coming. And at one point you said, “Okay, look, if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing.”

And I went to the school that my kids went to, which had this international program, and said, “Can you make space for two foreign kids?” And they said yes, but the kids have to be here the first day of school. And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation.

So I called Jim up and said, “Look, I can do it. I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day.” And to my shock, he actually said yes. And he like packed up his house and everything in the house in—I think we had 12 days to be in school. And we probably had to have the house back within less than a week. So that was a crazy week.

But Victor was a great help. We were going to a country we’d never been to before, didn’t know much about. Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything. He knew where the good schools were, he knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously. So yeah, it was a great experience.

It was an exciting time to be in China. It was right around the first Olympics, you know.

**[17:02] SPEAKER_00:** It was right around the Beijing Olympics, and so it’s a really exciting time. But yeah, you wound up staying for about 18 months, right, in total?

**[17:26] SPEAKER_02:** A little less, but yeah, it was over a year. And then we just kept in touch from there. Like, we loved working together.

What year did you arrive? What was this rough time? Who are you asking? Because it was different.

Oh, 2011. 2011 summer we’re driving all over the country. 2011 September—August, I can’t remember. We were in Beijing.

And then you’re back end of 2012 or early 2013, something like that. Yeah, we were back in the country in 2013. But like January.

**[17:56] SPEAKER_05:** Let me segue. I’ll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep everything in my mind here consistent. So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but basically, I had passed my qualifying exam. I’m going to say spring 2014, or maybe April or May 2014.

So for those who are not aware of how a PhD program works: qualifying exam is like one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis. So sometimes it’s a coursework requirement. Sometimes you need to translate an academic work from one language to another to show proficiency. I think most of them have dropped those requirements at this point. And so it’s a whole bunch of study, intense prep. At Berkeley it’s a three-hour oral exam with a couple of people from your department and one from an external department. And then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass, thankfully.

It was a—I don’t know that it was—everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good, right? While I passed it, I didn’t feel great at least the rest of that day.

When did you find out the result? Like immediately? Oh, you do? Okay, you put you in the hall and they tell you.

**[19:38] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Okay, that’s good. So you’re just like very nervous. I don’t know what it was like for you, but for me it was just like three guys I knew. I was nervous too, but it wasn’t like they had to go and calculate numbers or something. They just kind of come out and they’re like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.”

**[19:58] SPEAKER_05:** Exactly. It’s oral. It’s subjective in a sense, but you’ve got several of the world’s foremost experts in some subjects, so they’re able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research.

The qualifying exam led to I needed a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics. And I had almost taken a job working for a data science company that was taking—I can’t quite remember—something having to do with Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks. I can’t remember at this time. But it seemed like an okay thing.

I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I’m from New York. And, you know, as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture. And I didn’t fully do it. I’m prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kind of like it there. I’m sitting there right now, by the way. Yes, yes, Jim’s there. I’m in the state of New York at the moment.

But I needed a little break basically. And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project.

So somehow, my dad, Joe Lubin, got attached to the project basically because he was always tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time. He had a CS background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years. So he was always watching technological innovations in financial services, and always had a little bit of the blockchain philosophical character, in that, you know, pro-freedom, a little bit of a libertarian streak kind of thing.

And I believe he happened to just be visiting our families. He’s from Toronto. A lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. And he went, I believe, to—it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup. But this would have been January, February 2014, I believe. And Vitalik was speaking there. And like everyone around that time, where you see Vitalik speak about something, you get really excited, right?

And so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away. He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project. It didn’t turn out that way; we can go into it a little bit later. But he started working on it, again, let’s take February, March 2014.

So he just sent me the white paper right after—maybe right before—my qualifying exam. I got a chance to read it. It was pretty cool and interesting and new. And that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of the technology. And it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etc. And it was exciting enough to work on for that summer basically. So that’s how I got into it.

And subsequently, Jim alluded to this earlier: I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Shu, a great, great friend of ours. Kind of, I don’t know—not quite famously brilliant, definitely brilliant, somewhat famous. Super cool guy. I’d been a long-time reader of Steve’s blog. He’s one of the few really excellent general communicators who’s a super technical guy. Most people who are really technical have a hard time distilling it for at least a mass market audience. But Steve is actually good at that, with nuanced coverage of technical topics.

So anyway, caught up with Steve, and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim.

And I believe the first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York but was just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe June, July 2014. And maybe I came back in August or something like that. And it turned out that Jim was there in Hayward and we got to meet up.

**[24:58] SPEAKER_02:** What, do you really think August 2014? September something like that? Oh, it was around then, because ironically I was driving across the country that summer too. It was right after I came back, that’s all.

**[25:27] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, okay, that’s cool. How was Montana, by the way? Well, maybe we shouldn’t go—Montana oddly crypto-friendly.

**[25:56] SPEAKER_00:** Makes sense, big sky country, right? Okay, so let me see here. I have a couple other 2014 anecdotes that you guys may not even know that much about, but maybe we should jump ahead to 2015 and go back.

Just before we go past 2014: I moved back from China in 2014. And so me and Jim were talking about, like, “Oh, now that I was back, what kind of project could we do together?” So while you had started that conversation, me and Jim were thinking about, okay, maybe we could work on a startup together. And at some point you forwarded me the paper as well. So that’s kind of how I got into it as well.

**[26:31] SPEAKER_05:** I want to give—yeah, I don’t want to speak the whole time, but I have some info here that I forget if I told you guys at length.

Okay, go for it. In 2014, basically, I did work on the Ethereum project through a bunch of 2014 projects.

As far as tech projects go, it was much more global, a little more European. But you had Canada, you had a bunch of people in Zug, Switzerland, a little bit in Israel in the early days.

We worked out of an office, my dad and I, and a guy named Stephen Narayoff, who is now kind of famous. Actually, if you Google the name, it’s definitely an interesting and colorful story that I’ll go into a little bit. And a guy named Jonathan, whose last name I couldn’t find when I was writing this down. But Jonathan’s a good guy.

So we’re working in this office in Times Square and really trying to find different ways to advance the project, meeting with lots of people. That’s when I met Steve Shu, who introduced me to Jim basically. Just kind of calling up whoever might be interested.

But part of the plans that the Ethereum folks had was: they acknowledged that there would be a need for ongoing pure research, in addition to more focused R&D to build the network out. Vitalik at some point penned an article about “10 hard problems in cryptocurrency,” or something of that nature. If we went back now, it would look both very insightful and a little bit dated. I’m sure some of them have been solved and some of them may not need to be solved because something else emerged. But basically foresaw the need for privacy above and beyond pseudonymity, for instance, and many things with that: the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, energy-efficient blockchains, which people were talking about at that time.

My position in academia at that time seemed to be helpful, as the blockchain people were so different from the academia people, despite both of them being really smart groups of people. Blockchain people were not worried about doing things through the proper channels and approval and writing it up the right way and all that sort of thing. Whereas something about academia makes you fearful of being wrong, because you’re wrong enough in public, there are kind of consequences for it. And the tech attitude in general is: get something out there, get it to work, get it out, and then iterate. And blockchain people had that in an extreme.

And I would say also Ethereum was much more like that than the Bitcoin culture. The Bitcoin culture was like a bunch of practicing-but-academic cryptographers who never wanted to change anything. And the Ethereum people were more like: have the software and computer science engineering attitude of like, “Well, let’s get out there. Let’s tinker with it. Let’s kind of see what happens.”

There are good arguments for both, especially when you’re talking about a system that records a lot of high-value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred.

But all that is to say, it was useful for the Ethereum Foundation to have someone who was actively in academia to kind of work with and coordinate everything. So we agreed to work on a body called the Cryptocurrency Research Group. And that was composed of myself, Vitalik, and our friend Aaron Wright. He’s since gone on to a number of Web3 projects, but at the time was a practicing attorney, but also a professor at Cardozo Law School. And he came to that Times Square office, which was not the greatest of offices, and just really leaned in on Ethereum and kind of helped structure everything so that it would be the most robust, not just technology, but they actually did a quite good job in figuring out how to set things up that other projects since did certainly not do as good a job. So it was funny times.

In 2014, I also got to go to Zug. For those who don’t know, the Ethereum Foundation was one of the first to be headquartered in Switzerland. And it’s become a very popular choice for crypto foundations because I guess the Ethereum Foundation sort of blazed a path.

Funny thing about Switzerland is that the local authorities also just seem like business people. They want to land the future tax revenue and employment. Switzerland is split into some number of cantons, which are like states, a little smaller than US states. And so you can kind of go from canton to canton and try to get the best offer. And offer really means tax treatment, any kind of grants, or helping get fast answers around legal questions.

One of the tough things about the United States is that sometimes you don’t know what’s allowed. And the Swiss environment, they were fairly clear about what they wanted for the special tax treatment, etc.

So we went out and visited Zug mid-late summer 2014, and I got to meet all of the founders of Ethereum at that time. I believe they’re kind of eight in total. And those numbers changed over time, though. Yeah, those numbers change.

Vitalik—there’s always a global project, right? So Vitalik would kind of go around the world and evangelize, get people excited, and they would want to work with the project. And so a bunch of folks got attached to it. And it obviously worked, right? But if he were to do it again, I bet he would be a little bit more careful about adding folks to it because it is just too many. Like, if you went to a US venture capitalist with a slide that says “eight co-founders,” and they’re not all currently running billion dollar companies, you’d be laughed out of the room. And yet it worked. It actually functioned.

So kind of the way it broke apart was that there were the technical folks and the business folks, like any tech project. It didn’t really have a nominal CEO at any time. It was closest to being Charles Hoskinson. So I think at the time I went to Zug, the leadership looked like: on the business side, Charles is the CEO; Amir Chetrit, who is in Israel, kind of did business development; Joe, my dad, and Anthony Di Iorio as the other business guys who probably had the most operating experience. And then the tech side was Vitalik, Jeff Wilcke, Gavin Wood, and then Mihai had sort of done corporate setup. I believe Mihai worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin Magazine. So Vitalik is a very interesting character where most of the time your technical geniuses are not good communicators, and he was sort of a journalist, running Bitcoin Magazine, writing a lot of the articles. I don’t know if he started it or kind of joined it. And he would—he kind of crowdfunded the articles a little bit, like, “If I can get a pledge of one Bitcoin, I’ll write an article about X.” At the time, Bitcoin was inexpensive, but those values went up, and I think it actually ended up being a good funding mechanism, and it led him to kind of have a sort of impartial thought leader position, in addition to his really strong technical ability and the ideas he was generating.

I know he had joined a bunch of projects early on and helped work with them. Like I think Mastercoin was maybe the first colored coin project; he did some work on that.

Anyway, those were the eight at the time. There was a meeting for everyone to kind of get on the same page. Remote project, there was a Slack—people were maybe working a little bit at cross purposes, lots of infighting. People are stressed. They’re trying to deliver on this awesome concept that Vitalik put out there. And then everyone kind of tried to grab ownership of, like, was there a reason to have all these different clients? In the end, empirically, it worked, but a little bit of it was an “I want Ethereum to be mine” sort of thing. And I saw this in the room when we were visiting there.

So basically, it was quite dramatic, the trip. Everyone went outside at some point and people were kind of sick. The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing to some extent. There’s always this tension, especially early in a company, where the tech people are like, “What do I need you business guy for? We’re going to make this thing and it’s going to get out there.” And the business people have to go raise the money, find sales, find partnerships, etc. It’s subjective stuff that the tech people don’t like or sometimes understand.

More or less this happened. People were uncomfortable with kind of promises that Charles was making, and just the accusations—I don’t really even know. I know Charles some, but I don’t even really know what was going on at that time.

But there was this general sense of frustration with him. He also seems to be, in some ways, executing well on an effective smart business strategy, but maybe overpromising what’s possible to the point of bringing people out. And then we’ve kind of seen later, I think some of the stuff with Cardano was probably at least aggressive, I would say. But the jury was not out at that time in my eyes.

Amir also was a target because I think people just thought he wasn’t doing enough, it sounded like. And so they were both jettisoned from the project in Zug. They were out on the terrace. It’s like—they had a nice sort of loft that they rented, that was like the Ethereum dev house in Zug. And so I’m watching this happen, and it was quite crazy.

And then actually they instated two more co-founders, so to speak, right then, who kind of jumped on board the project and helped out. It was a fun and kind of crazy trip.

Otherwise, we went out in Zurich. Some people got in trouble with the cops. I won’t add more detail to that. But Zurich’s a funny place where, in the US, we’re not used to people drinking on the street. And in Zurich, everyone drinks on the street and few people are in the bar. It was a strange experience. We went on some hikes. It’s a very nice part of the world, Switzerland. But plenty of drama in the early days.

I remember having a funny conversation with Mihai about—he had this book about swarm behavior. And he learned I had a mathematical background. We were talking about the mathematics of swarms and all that sort of thing.

But yeah: it felt nascent, intense, but disorganized. They were also grappling with the decision on: initially they wanted to have a nonprofit protocol and a for-profit they called it “crypto Google” at the time, to sort of monetize the nonprofit protocol. And plenty of blockchain companies have gone and done that sort of thing subsequently. But that was also decided at that meeting, that they would be all not-for-profit. And people didn’t like it. Some folks started talking about brain drain. It was a mix: some people liked it, some didn’t. Sort of the threat being like, “If you don’t do this for-profit, I’m gonna leave this project” kind of thing.

And I think everyone sort of went off and did start their own businesses.

**[42:30] SPEAKER_00:** So, you know, it is what it is. But anyway—let me pause and see if you got—did I tell this whole story to you guys at any point?

I think you told parts of it, not the entire thing. But yes, I didn’t realize the sort of Game of Thrones aspect happened in all of that period, short period of time.

**[42:53] SPEAKER_05:** I knew that all that had happened behind the scenes. I think it was going on continually, but it came to a head all in this one meeting.

A funny memory: we—Bitcoin Suisse was getting off the ground at that time. And we met with a guy named Nicholas, I believe, who maybe was the CEO or one of the founders. I just Googled it; it says founder, and there’s a different CEO now. But he made this funny comment—he’s a nice guy.

I think something happened there. I’m not quite sure. He made this funny comment: we were in an elevator, and it was like one of the ones where it’s kind of hand-operated and you do it yourself. And it’s just like the door could easily close on you. And I was like, “Wow, we’d never have this in the US because we’re so litigious.” And they said, “Well, yeah. Swiss attitude: natural selection.”

So anyway, I don’t know. Sometimes I think things get grandfathered in, like some of those subway platforms in New York are pretty terrifying too. It could just mean that it’s older there, right? That makes sense.

But yes, I think the big other than Zug—we saw, or let me see, there was growing momentum around the project. Lots of people all over the world kind of working on it. Stuff was probably not tightly papered. There’s no employment agreements probably at that time. But there was really intense excitement and I think the belief that everyone was going to be mega successful out of it, one way or another. It’s been kind of interesting to watch.

Jim, do you want to talk about getting into it? And I alluded to all the different clients of Ethereum and the reason why there was more than one. Do you want to tell your report of that part now?

**[44:52] SPEAKER_02:** Well, this part of the story—when you were doing all that stuff, I was too busy driving around the country. But I came back. It comes in a little later, like two, three months later, right? Or the rest of that—right at the end of the summer, right when you were coming back, I think. So that’s when I got really interested in it.

I remember the whole culture. I got fascinated with the technology when I read the white paper. That’s when I realized this was something big. And I wanted to immerse myself into the world a little bit, but it was a foreign culture to me.

Natasha, my wife, and I decided just to see what this world was like. We’d try buying a little Bitcoin. And I remember we looked a little bit at the various ways to do it, and the way we decided on was to meet someone in a coffee shop in the middle of Berkeley. And we got there and he was totally the stereotype. The dude was walking around with like the five-toed shoes. And it all felt very salacious. We walked in with this packet of money in our hands, and we had to meet this guy. He spent most of the time there railing against the government, how much he hated the US government and all the terrible things they were doing. And we kind of transferred the envelope over to him. And then we pulled up a computer or our phones or something, and we were watching for six blocks to come by. And finally it went through, and we were finally Bitcoin owners.

Did you use LocalBitcoins? That was popular. I don’t know if it’s still in existence.

Yeah, LocalBitcoins.

I remember: did you hang out with him for an hour? Or did he—because I think we did wait for this.

We were good. We made it. But maybe after three he said to us, like, “You’re welcome to stay here if you want, but I find that after three it probably won’t revert,” or something. Oh, I remember what it was: we went out and sat in the car for another 30 minutes just in case we had to run back in again. So that’s really funny.

So that was our introduction into Bitcoin.

And then around this time, you and I started hanging out a lot. We were meeting regularly. And I had started working on the Haskell client, and I brought you in on that. And we’d have these coding sessions at your place.

**[47:29] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah. So that’s fall 2014, right? When we started coding?

**[47:43] SPEAKER_02:** I was laughing when you were talking about the overpromising. I was immediately fascinated by Ethereum, but I also remember trying to understand what it was at the beginning. Some of the material out there was great, but some of it was just very vague and overbroad. I would go to these YouTube videos and people would be like, “Ethereum is a new way of life. It’s going to take over as a second internet. We are going to rebuild the internet from beginning to end.” I was like, what are they talking about?

And so the only way I was going to really understand this stuff, I thought, was to literally just start writing code. You can’t hide what is happening once you have—so I talked about the white paper, but Gavin Wood had put up a yellow paper at the same time, which talked about the technical details of the innards. And so I started looking through that and implementing that in my favorite language, Haskell. And bit by bit, putting the whole EVM in Haskell code.

So that’s what most of the end of the year was like. Until I think in December, I was—so I’m from the East Coast myself, and we flew out to New York. And I met you—you introduced me; you were there at the time too—you introduced me to Joe Lubin. And actually, I think before that too, you had set up phone calls where I talked to Vitalik and Joe directly too. So more and more, with the fact that we had a working client, that we were following very closely all the changes in the testnet era before things were solidified, we just got pulled more and more into that world.

**[49:38] SPEAKER_05:** We’ve been sort of assuming an expert audience. Can you define the term “client” for everybody?

**[49:45] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, so it’s the software that blockchain runs on. The thing about usual software is that if I just run a video game or something, I just get a computer and I put the software on it. And that’s my running project. In a blockchain, it’s a distributed thing. So you have to create a piece of software that can be run from anywhere in the world on multiple computers simultaneously. So you’re building sort of a world computer of nodes, they call them. And so we were building one of these nodes that could connect to the existing testnet at the time.

**[50:26] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, gotcha. Perfect. Putting us in the client’s arms race, if you will. That was the one I was trying to make.

I want to talk real quickly about some other things from that summer. You guys participated in the crowdsale, did you not? That’s why you bought the Bitcoin the first time? Or did you buy it sort of first?

**[50:55] SPEAKER_02:** Got a token amount.

**[50:58] SPEAKER_05:** Gotcha. So from our side, we ended up—mostly my dad, but obviously with help from the Ethereum people.

So they coded up a site to do the crowdsale. Ethereum was one of the first, maybe the first, to pioneer basically a pre-funding event, if you will, where they sold the token Ether in exchange for Bitcoin to the users. Basically an ICO, right? It was essentially an ICO. There was no name for it then.

But I remember the price varied a little bit over the course of the sale, but it was like one Bitcoin to 2,000 Ether, which meant you made pretty good returns if you participated in the crowdsale and sold at the right time—or still holding.

But the way it worked, it was complicated. So Ethereum itself made ICOs pretty easy. For Bitcoin, it was basically: I think the Ethereum Foundation had to set up an address for you to send the Bitcoin to so that they could mint the Ether in the genesis block for you.

But the Foundation, rightfully in decentralization terms, did not want to just hold everybody’s keys. So you had to generate your own keys, and the website did this, and download them. And there’s these huge warnings like, “You must download this file. If you lose this file, you will lose access to your funds.”

Some of the Ethereum folks coded it up. There was some— I think they generated unique addresses for each funding event for traceability’s sake. I’m not quite sure if they did that. Maybe there was just one Exodus address, all that sort of thing. Actually, no, there must have been just one.

So we were a little bit the help desk. Sometimes people would try and it wouldn’t work, try to purchase Ether. And there were interesting goings-on. There was like a fake Twitter account that emerged with the “e” and the “u” in “Ethereum” transposed, so it looked just like Ethereum. And they had assembled 25,000 followers or something—no doubt bots that whatever hacker controlled, or maybe you pay for those. And they were offering special deals on Ether.

So it went live. This is something that’s been going on for 10 years now. Even new crypto projects, when they start to get popular, people start selling their tokens over Twitter even before those tokens are issued now. They’ve gotten more sophisticated.

But yeah, I remember reaching out to a friend of mine who was working at Twitter at the time and helping escalate the ticket, because a big theft could occur.

And I believe Jonathan configured one of the block explorers—maybe it was blockchain.info, I can’t remember—so that every time money hit a certain address, a noise would play. So we were in this room. We were in the room all day because it’s help desk mode. And we just hear the things come in.

There was a schedule over like 14 days you could fund at no monetary consequence. And then the price started to go up over the course of, I believe, a 42-day sale. All in all, I think 7,000 unique purchasers, something like that. It was quite an affair. It’s definitely more streamlined now.

And to clear the way to do all of this, they got a legal opinion that they’re selling software, in essence, to people, from a reputable law firm. And all that made it to the terms and conditions. It was a big rush to get it all done.

And then I think that raised—I don’t even remember—it’s like 22 million bucks at the time?

**[55:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I thought it was—well, it was in Bitcoin, so I think it was like 20 million. I remember vaguely that it was, at the time of the sale, 22 million. I think it was the biggest crowdfunding event ever or something.

**[55:51] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, I believe that’s right. It’s either one or two ever at that time. And it’s since been surpassed by tons, many of which—yeah, exactly.

Interestingly, in the course of the sale—and maybe a little bit having to do with the sale—the price of Bitcoin starts to go down. So I believe it’s 600 or so at the start of the sale. And we notice it dropping kind of continually, I guess. And maybe at the end of it, it’s like high fours, low fives, and it’ll kind of go on to drop from there.

But yeah—okay. So did you guys remember the experience of the funding site and all that sort of thing? I think we were not speaking about that specific detail at that time.

I remember the site. I remember the clock on it, but I don’t remember too much else about it.

Yeah. Okay. So the crowdsale is not a huge part of your memory. It’s a huge part of mine, I guess, because we were dealing with all of the issues.

But Vic, you were just getting kind of interested at this time, right?

**[57:00] SPEAKER_00:** Well, yeah, exactly. Jim—when he was going to buy this Bitcoin, he was like, “Oh, I’m going to buy this Bitcoin to participate in the crowdsale. Do you want to participate?” And I was like, “I’m going to feel like a real idiot if I don’t do anything.” So it was just some nominal amount that we did. And of course it’s probably turned into the best investment I ever made.

But yeah, we had to pull our resources together because it was so hard. It wasn’t easy, right? You’re generating these seed phrases, this, that, and the other. It just was mind-bogglingly complicated.

But I think the biggest problem with the step was getting actual Bitcoin. Jim was in the Bay Area, right, the heart of all tech things. I was in Vancouver. Vancouver was an early Bitcoin adopter, but it was still really, really hard to find anyone who would be willing to sell you Bitcoin.

**[58:04] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, yeah. That’s very interesting.

Okay, so the sale happens, and now the project is funded. And it’s really funded. I suppose there are plenty of mega VC investments at that time, but the bubble years in 2020, 2021 were not heard of at this time. Series A investments were still between like three and 10 million bucks. Salaries probably a little lower than they are now. This was a lot of money.

And so the Ethereum folks then kind of—It was very technically driven. They kicked in all of their technical dreams, so to speak. So Jim’s point about the really big claims: they really were, in a sense, trying to create a whole new internet.

A couple examples: not just the proliferation of clients, they’re going to make a browser, the Mist browser. They’re going to make a peer-to-peer messaging system called Whisper. They’re going to make a decentralized file storage system. They chose to make a virtual machine like Java. And we always thought that JavaScript was the better analogy because it kind of won on the internet. Has anyone ever seen an applet in the last 15, 20 years?

But they made multiple languages that would compile to the EVM. There’s some benefits to that. It’s definitely evolved over time.

I don’t know, do you have a more specific memory of: they were making a lot of stuff. It was—can you get into the experience of trying to make something compatible with what they were doing at that time?

**[1:00:13] SPEAKER_02:** Well, once I found the yellow paper, it wasn’t as difficult because that centered me around the blockchain part of it. But it was that earlier marketing material that was very confusing to me because they would talk about—you would have these videos like “What is Ethereum?” and then it would just go off into all these things like you mentioned: a browser, a messaging system. And I think there was even some talk in there about replacing TCP/IP or something. I can’t remember. Some of these things actually came into being. Some of these didn’t.

I think my learning process was first realizing what blockchain was, but then digging a little deeper and being confused that I didn’t really know what was happening because I thought this was going to be a blockchain project and then they were talking about writing browsers. And then realizing, when I saw the yellow paper, that yeah, this is the core of what Ethereum is. That other stuff is sort of like pipe dream stuff that may or may not come to being. But yeah, so that’s how it went.

And then once I got the concrete testnet work, then I understood what was going on.

**[1:01:29] SPEAKER_05:** Gotcha. Yeah, yeah. It was wild.

I can’t even remember quite how we got the idea, but we were talking about—for whatever reason, a bunch of people were going to be in the Bay Area late January 2015. And we decided to—I had also, through Steve, through Ben Lorica, who’s a great guy, who was at the time head of data science, but also really the head of content for O’Reilly’s conferences—we booked a conference at Fort Mason. I had a co-host named Lauren Lance, also running a crypto startup these days, I believe. Also a great guy.

So given that the conference was on the calendar and we knew a bunch of people in part for the conference—but I think something else was going on too—we decided to run kind of a parallel technical conference that week, which we named the Crypto Economicon.

I think the term “crypto economics” either was invented or popularized by Vitalik. There’s also this guy named Vlad Zamfir, I don’t know quite how to pronounce his last name, who’s worked a lot with Vitalik on proof-of-stake and other things, and went on to start his own fairly successful crypto project (the name of which is currently escaping me). Funny guy. He would say, like, “Crypto economics: is it crypto or is it economics?” And it certainly never really stuck, but that was the theme of the conference.

So we had like two academic-track days and a business-track day, I believe. We had a bunch of speakers, one of whom spoke at the O’Reilly meeting and then would also speak at Crypto Economicon.

The building we did it in—so we were co-hosted with a company called Coinify, which I don’t believe exists anymore. A nice guy named Tom Ding. But I guess Tom Ding had some good capital and access with the Chinese government. Like—

**[1:05:37] SPEAKER_00:** Do you remember the details around who owned that building? I think it was some construction conglomerate. I remember going like, “What does this have to do with construction?” It didn’t have anything to do with tech at all. It was just—

That’s the thing I remember most about it. So yes, in this— I just want to say I should point out that you guys met each other at this conference too.

We met each other—we’d already been having conversations online, I think, because you guys would get together and we’d chat sometimes, but we’d never actually met each other in person until that conference.

It was like a month or two or three in, I think, at that time.

**[1:06:32] SPEAKER_05:** And it was a cast of characters. The O’Reilly conference is a little more shiny corporate—pretty successful. The Crypto Economicon conference was great but kind of crazy. There was a guy whose name is escaping me—smart guy, very tight bike shorts—and he kept raising his hand. I think he had like a defense background. I’m trying to remember.

IBM had a big speaking slot at the time. They were promoting Ethereum plus some other technologies as like the key to their IoT stack.

**[1:07:18] SPEAKER_00:** I’m trying to even remember—okay, I actually looked this up. So the participants: it was a very small group of people, like I think 20, 25. But among that group of people was—yeah, Vlad who did proof-of-stake was there. Vitalik was there. Gavin was there, who was working on Ethereum but later went on to do Polkadot. Dominic, who went to do Internet Computer, was there. I think Jae Kwon was there, who went off to do Cosmos. A bunch of Bitcoin Core devs were there.

It was just a crazy group of people to be—if you looked at the amount of talent, like I know people talk about the PayPal mafia. That was like the crypto mafia. Almost everyone in that room went off to do a pretty successful project.

But I remember being in that room and kind of—we’d started talking and I was really starting on my journey about learning about Ethereum and I was completely baffled. I spent probably 90% of the time on Wikipedia trying to figure out: what does the Byzantine Generals Problem have to do with technology? Why are they talking about this? Or SNARKs—what are SNARKs?

I remember trying to madly keep up with these things, but being in that room was exciting. It was the first time that I ever totally clicked that what they were trying to do was a new kind of computing platform. And it always got overshadowed by the financial money crypto aspect of it, right? But in that room it was very different. Everyone was really focused on, like, okay, how do we build this world computer?

And yeah, the talent level was off the chart in that room. It’s just amazing.

Vicky should tell the Robin Hanson story.

**[1:09:34] SPEAKER_05:** For the context of the listener, if we forget any: Robin Hanson is a really smart guy, kind of famous, sort of quite technical economist. I think he’s at George Mason or something like that. Good Twitter follow too. You should follow him.

**[1:09:52] SPEAKER_00:** Well, he invented prediction markets basically. Pretty much he’s the father of prediction markets.

So to be clear, Robin Hanson is way smarter than I’ll ever be. But I was in that conference, madly in Wikipedia for the three days ahead of O’Reilly. We ourselves were all pretty new to the blockchain. And it was—people were going really, really deep into these conceptual things.

But after those three days was the O’Reilly conference. And at one point in the O’Reilly conference they had sort of a lunch where everyone sat around these big tables, kind of a networking part of it. And I remember Robin was one of the panelists on some panel about blockchain. And he was asking me like, “Oh, what do I do? And what was I here for?” And we had a conversation, and I just kind of summarized a few things that I learned over the past three days.

So we had this conversation and I said, “You know, it’s not really about money. It’s about building this world computer,” and all these things. And he basically got on stage and reiterated a bunch of things I told him during lunch. And everyone was like, “How did Robin become a blockchain expert? Like he’s really on the cutting edge of where this technology is.” But it was just amazing.

**[1:11:27] SPEAKER_05:** It was quite a room of people. We had some other—Robin’s also a bit of a futurist. We had another kind of futurist guy named Steve Omohundro, I don’t know how to pronounce it, who’s a super smart guy as well, and I’ve not really spoken to in a long time. But I think there was an energy in the air that was quite palpable.

**[1:11:53] SPEAKER_00:** I don’t know—this was a big thing that convinced us to start our company, I would say. I think the thing that kind of convinced us was: it was like being in two rooms, right?

There was Crypto Economicon where it was like everyone was talking about this new kind of computing platform and all the things it could do. And then there was the O’Reilly conference where you had a bunch of big bankers, and Reid Hoffman was there, and people, and they were talking about money like this was about money. And it was clear that they didn’t know what was really going on in the other room, like something much, much bigger was happening.

And I think that convinced us as like, “Oh, we could build a bridge between these two worlds.”

**[1:12:51] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, I remember that distinctly. It was such a funny time. The big headliners at the O’Reilly conference: Reid Hoffman, Balaji spoke, Bill Janeway, I believe, and some others.

Okay. I want to shift gears to the client race, which we’ve hit on. But at this point I got really into it. I was never a professional-quality software developer. I learned in school enough how to program software, but was not. And I kind of learned enough of that quickly on the job with Jim. As Jim alluded to, we would meet up at my Berkeley apartment. I think first we were meeting at—on Telegraph, just north of Ashby, right by the Oakland border, and then later we met at a different—very close to campus.

**[1:14:22] SPEAKER_02:** On Bancroft and Telegraph. And so it was an open source project. And because lots of people were making their own versions of it, there was sort of a fight for the definition of it, which is in the end settled by the yellow paper.

But the Ethereum Foundation was trying pretty hard to put the specs out there, but still things were changing faster than the yellow paper could keep up. So I would just have something to the point where it was connecting and communicating and running the virtual machine. And then next day I’d come in and it completely wouldn’t work. And maybe a few weeks later, the yellow paper would be updated to explain why. But in the meantime, the only way that I could sort of figure stuff out was to go and get one of the other clients and read: how in the world are they getting this thing to work?

And there was one point when they added encryption to the connection that essentially changed the protocol completely. I connected, nothing was working anymore. I had to dig in and—

**[1:15:18] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, I had repressed that memory.

So mostly Jim figured all of this out. But they put, for the technical audience, kind of the equivalent of something like SSL into the product.

**[1:16:07] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. They put end-to-end encryption in. It was a complex handshake and then a session was created between peers.

It’s really hard to implement stuff like that because all of the messages you’re getting back are encrypted. So you have to get it totally perfect and then it makes sense. But if you don’t get it perfect, nothing makes sense and you don’t know why.

I was irrationally angry about it. I didn’t care whether this was good or bad for the product, but I was genuinely confused too. Because you have this open network that anyone can connect to, but you want to encrypt everything that’s going on it. It took me a while to figure out why that actually happened.

I was asking around in various DM services—I don’t remember where I used to go and talk to people. I found the giant Skype threads, I remember at the time.

**[1:16:32] SPEAKER_05:** There were huge Skype threads. Slack was just getting popular at this time. Ethereum had a Slack. ConsenSys had a Slack.

**[1:17:08] SPEAKER_02:** I dug around a while to figure out why in the world encryption had even been added to this. And I kept getting sort of, “Oh, we want to make sure that this information is private.” And I was like, “It doesn’t make sense. I can connect anywhere and see this stuff.”

Finally I found one of the people that had implemented it. And the idea wasn’t crazy. It had nothing to do with—I mean, I guess it had something to do with encryption, but their thought process is that it was more about identity. Once you join, you wanted to have essentially like a cert that verified that you are who you say you are, and they wanted that there for the various extensions that they were putting in. And so, okay, that wasn’t crazy. It was very annoying to me to spend a week of my life trying to implement this.

But the other thing that’s kind of funny is that there were kind of like two tiers of software developers in the original testnet. There were those who were around from the beginning—that I was not in that group, again, driving around the country. And that included Python (which was Vitalik’s), C++ and Geth.

There was sort of a distrust in standards. So the thing a usual software engineer would do would be to get SSL and implement it with that, or to take hash algorithms that had a corporate stamp of approval and put that in. But they always wanted to put things a little bit outside of there because I think they feared, maybe truthfully, backdoors and all of these things.

And so I essentially had to go and get a lot of non-standard encryption algorithms and paste them together into an SSL-like thing.

**[1:18:46] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah. I can add a little bit on that. I would say the building blocks were at least semi-standard. They use the same elliptic curve as Bitcoin for the actual signatures and transfer the money and all that.

They didn’t invent hashing algorithms or signing algorithms. But the composition is something you have to be quite careful about.

**[1:20:12] SPEAKER_02:** For instance, the hashing algorithm that they chose to use in the early days, they were calling it SHA-3. But SHA-3 hadn’t been finalized at that point in time. So they were taking the proposal. I went and got the code in the Haskell code base that did the proposed SHA-3 at that point in time. And then one day I kind of went into the C++ client and looked around and they started calling it Keccak. And I was like, “What’s going on here? Why did they change the algorithm?” But it was still connecting to what I had there.

So I was a little bit confused. And I found out later what had happened was there had been a last-minute change in SHA-3, and the Ethereum team felt that this was a government backdoor that was being put in there, and they refused to put that change in. And so they stuck with the original proposal, which was called Keccak, which is something that I had already implemented there. But they aren’t technically SHA-3 anymore.

**[1:21:25] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, sure. I have a vague memory. I’m not saying it was a government backdoor. I don’t know one way or the other, but that was their belief.

Can you talk a little bit about—you’re talking to Roman some at this time. Who’s Roman, and what was going on? I still remember the issue of sync.

**[1:22:00] SPEAKER_02:** There were kind of like two tiers. Roman was the Java client. Roman’s last name: Mandeleil? I don’t know how to pronounce it. M-A-N-D-E-L—something like that.

So Roman did Java. Gavin was doing C++. Jeff was doing Go, I think. And then Vitalik Python. But Roman and I were the later guys. And I did the Haskell client. And Roman may or may not have been in the Ethereum Foundation. I was not in the Ethereum Foundation, but I met with those guys a number of times.

But the thing that everybody—maybe what you were alluding to—I’m not sure precisely what story you’re looking for, but sync speed was the thing that everybody would compete against.

I remember going to various meetups and Roman would always run up to me and he’s like, “How long does it take you to sync up to a million blocks?” in the testnet now. So there was always this competitiveness around sync speed, which is an important thing, but there are other things too. And so everybody was just rushing to get sync speed faster and faster at that point in time.

**[1:24:31] SPEAKER_05:** The thing I wanted to capture is: in some ways it seemed a little juvenile at the time, but it was also genius. You’ve got a lot of technical energy all focused around this one thing, Ethereum. These people probably could have tried to make their own Ethereum-like blockchain or Bitcoin-like blockchain. It was sort of open source, “may the best get merged” attitude. And it probably made for a better product at the end of the day.

I also remember they flooded the testnets with giant blocks of data at some point. There was a lot of—the people were treating it like this is a spacecraft launch. You had to really stress test it because it was going to be the new world computer. So in some ways, while the development was far more incremental than Bitcoin, there was still very stringent and perhaps unrealistic scenario testing before the launch.

**[1:25:54] SPEAKER_00:** I think one thing that’s kind of interesting about it also is that it was very meritocratic, right? There was all this competition going on. Even though Gavin was technically CTO and Vitalik is obviously Vitalik, but they didn’t win. The one that won was Jeff’s Go client. You could imagine in any other scenario, they could have just put their foot down and said, “No, we’re going to go with Python,” or “No, we’re going to go with C++.” But they went with the one that actually performed the best and was doing the best.

**[1:26:32] SPEAKER_02:** It was a surprise to me. I was always treating C++ as the reference client. And Gavin was sort of more of a spokesman over there at the time. Jeff was sort of quieter.

At the last minute, I think there was some discussion about they needed to go through a security audit. And the story I heard—I don’t know if it’s true or not—is that they chose to do Geth first, thinking that the C++ would be the last thing and they would put that out there. But he kind of quietly went through that.

And honestly—maybe I’ll step on toes saying this—but from using all of these clients, Geth was the most stable at the time. I would always start it and it would run. C++ was changing a lot, and so often I would start it and, “Oh, it’s not working today.”

I think that plus the security pushed it over, and people used that one a lot.

**[1:27:31] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah, I have a similar memory. And of course, Gavin went on later to create Parity, the Rust version, which I think got pretty popular. I’m not quite sure where it stands today.

Talking about security, I want to hone in on the theme of the shifting launch date. Do you remember, Victor, we had started to some extent working as part of a company related to all this, and we’re getting worried because they kept adding more stuff, basically?

**[1:28:09] SPEAKER_02:** I’ll tell you: it would have continued except for a bit of luck that in a way was lucky. What ended up happening is Bitcoin crashed at that time and it really put the fire under everybody’s feet that they had to get this thing out immediately. Because their holdings weren’t in Bitcoin. And so I think if that hadn’t happened, there wouldn’t have been the pressure to push it out right then and there. And they might have just kept adding and modifying indefinitely after that.

**[1:28:46] SPEAKER_05:** So I believe the Foundation was paying people sort of denominated in the fiat currency, but with Bitcoin. So, you know, if it’s X number of thousand euro or USD per month, the Bitcoin amount would vary.

And yes, to that end, everyone—I remember in that room at Zug, there was discussion of like, “Well, what if Bitcoin goes to 10,000?” Because that would be really high at that time. Like, “We shouldn’t convert it.” And they ended up being right. I think the prudent move would have been at least some diversification in the treasury.

I believe they kept it all in Bitcoin and paid it out, I think, in Bitcoin. But again, the amount would vary. And of course some bills just had to be in euro or USD or Swiss francs. So there was no avoiding the fact that runway was shrinking.

They had brought in the roughly 22 million, ramping up big dev teams, a lot of redundancy. I think three full dev teams for the clients. Maybe half a dev team for Python because it was kind of just Vitalik working out how it all works. It was not going to be as fast as the others because it was in Python.

They started paying the JavaScript people later. There’s development of the Mist browser. Libraries and tooling started getting going. They were doing a lot, and almost all of it was technical. Not too much had a business development focus.

And yeah, then the price drops and suddenly what had gone—I believe they had forecast a 2016 launch timeline, and it got moved up to maybe July 2015.

So we’re sitting there in March, we’re like, “Oh, you’re telling us the thing is going to launch in 2016. Should we be doing this?” And then it moves up. It was great that it moved up.

Jim, do you recall—how do you remember how you predicted roughly when it would launch?

**[1:31:45] SPEAKER_05:** No, I’m not sure what you’re referring to. I think you plotted a commit graph where it was like commits by day in the Ethereum repo.

Yes, I remember this.

I don’t remember this, but okay, I don’t doubt I did it.

And so like the July date called a couple—was after the deadline had been moved a couple times. So basically, they’re running out of money. They move the launch date way up, right? And they move it. I remember thinking very heavily about how it had been changing very quickly and then it slowed down and I was happy.

**[1:31:45] SPEAKER_00:** And I will say that 2016 date happened after a series of changing dates, because we were like, “Hey, you know, we want to launch this company, but we need—we were still connected to hopefully the live net at the time.” So we were trying to time our thing. And they were changing dates all the time too.

And so I think the 2016 date was like the last one before they kind of changed their mind and refocused.

**[1:32:13] SPEAKER_05:** There were many eras which everyone has copied since. There’s “Serenity.” After it launched there’s “Metropolis,” “Serenity,” you know. They were like epochs where there would be testing of the software. And they intended to stay in testnet for quite a long time. That’s the upshot.

And I
