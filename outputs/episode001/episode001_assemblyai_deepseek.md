**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Alrighty, so we're on. Thanks. So my name is Kieran James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James from OzDR and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Blockapps which has been in operation for quite some time. But that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened and so we wanted to kind of get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity and here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion. But we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a Kieran produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes.

Alrighty, so let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad of Bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of $14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. So that said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

**[02:31] SPEAKER_01:** Aware is different than interested. In fact, I was coming from an academic background so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But I was a little bit too above all that, like oh, that's like a money thing. I'm not interested in that money world. So really, no. The interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who is an old friend of mine, and Kieran had been following his blog. And Steve called me up and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing. And so at first I was like yeah, you know, I'm not interested in all this fake money thing. And I went and I read the white paper, and by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about banking or something. This is about incentivization on the Internet. And that drew me in.

At that point I wanted to dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how that worked. At the time it was a testnet and that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there. So I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

**[03:53] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, let's pick that up. Jim, I'm trying to stay a little chronological. So I was 2010, 2011, sounds like the same time frame for you. I think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era and talk in more detail. But let's hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you want to take it?

**[04:14] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I felt really disconnected from North America. So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWiT that was all technical podcasts. And one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast Security Now, which went really deep into security technical things and did a couple episodes on Bitcoin and I was really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle. To the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it. Didn't get any Bitcoin, where if I did, I didn't notice it. I wish. I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this.

But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups there'd be like groups of computers in part of their office. And I was like, what are those for? They're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin. And I was like, why are you mining Bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, you know, we can transfer money and it's basically free Internet magic money. And I was honestly kind of repelled by that. That kind of seemed like too nutty even for me at the time.

**[05:41] SPEAKER_01:** Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**[05:44] SPEAKER_00:** I never hated it. I was just not that interested, I guess. From the East Coast, the attitude towards stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. Jim had long since been out in California doing his thing.

**[06:08] SPEAKER_01:** You're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like, I guess I didn't hate it. I just felt I was too good for it.

**[06:14] SPEAKER_00:** I see.

**[06:15] SPEAKER_02:** I think I found the technical aspect fascinating. But the part that kind of turned me off was when you talked to some of the early people that I would ask, like who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs, they were kind of fanatical. Like there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off.

**[06:51] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it. But I think it was too fringe to attract the classically most successful people at that time. Whereas fighting for jobs in math or physics or something, it's just the most horsepower wins from an intellectual perspective and I guess the hardest working horsepower. Very few of those people got interested in crypto blockchain. A few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones compared to younger ones like folks like Dan Boneh, etc. But yeah, I don't know that it was that I was too good for it. But I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

**[08:09] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. I would describe my view of it in the early days as sketchy because most of the use cases that I thought the technology was fascinating. But whenever I would ask about use cases, people would describe things to circumvent existing laws. Like the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass foreign exchange rules and stuff. And I was like, is that legal? And like, no one would mention anything afterwards, basically.

**[08:44] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well, I want to say good.

**[08:48] SPEAKER_01:** I got over feeling too good for it, I'll tell you that.

**[08:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, we all did. I want to touch on Mount Gox. So Mount Gox was that first big price run up. I believe Bitcoin went from like $30 to $1200 in a pretty short time frame. And as we've seen in the last couple crypto asset bubbles, consumer interest tracks with the price and people get excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top. Crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound, but I guess the question is, do you guys remember Mount Gox distinctly? I feel like lots of people I knew who were not quite crypto savvy in the industry, etc, were suddenly paying attention when Mount Gox was happening.

**[10:26] SPEAKER_01:** I was just getting into things. What year was it? Was it 2015? 2014? 2014, probably.

**[10:32] SPEAKER_00:** I think Mount Gox was 2013. Let me check.

**[10:34] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, okay.

**[10:35] SPEAKER_01:** 2013.

**[10:37] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[10:37] SPEAKER_01:** Okay. So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time. I was new enough to it that it was still interesting to me. But yeah, I think I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with blockchain. It was a problem with Mount Gox.

**[11:12] SPEAKER_00:** I think you're right. So the run up was actually end of 2013 into the beginning of 2014, it looks like. Okay. So it officially shuttered February 2014 though. The big $1200 that I remember was like November 2013, it looks like.

**[11:30] SPEAKER_02:** When did the hack happen?

**[11:31] SPEAKER_00:** December. Oh, I think right here.

**[11:33] SPEAKER_02:** Okay. Okay. Yeah, right there. Yeah.

**[11:38] SPEAKER_00:** So, yeah, interesting times for sure, because.

**[11:41] SPEAKER_02:** I think Mount Gox and Silk Road were kind of intertwined in those early days. Right. So I remember even going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about. And I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there. Lots of illicit stuff was listed there.

**[12:11] SPEAKER_00:** You know, that's.

**[12:13] SPEAKER_02:** Wow.

**[12:14] SPEAKER_00:** You know, I think I never did that. I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road. Just heard about it at like, I had to make a Mt. Gox account and some others. There was a period where like Dwolla was doing crypto stuff and then I think they stopped and I believe they're still around as like a payment API company. But yeah, because I definitely used them and some others.

**[12:38] SPEAKER_02:** I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mount Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other. And that was like the first iteration of crypto and blockchain is dead now and then it just keeps coming back.

**[12:59] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it sure does. Okay.

**[13:03] SPEAKER_01:** There's a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. If there's fraud and it happens on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that we might need a little more regulation or something, but that was a bad person. So it's always much more tied into the price of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens. But you don't see crashing because somebody commits fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess if the fraud's big enough. But.

**[13:43] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I agreed. Just segueing quickly. Can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first. And then we can do the whole how we all met.

**[13:56] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, Jim, do you want to start or do you want to start?

**[14:01] SPEAKER_01:** I'll start.

**[14:02] SPEAKER_00:** And.

**[14:02] SPEAKER_01:** And I'll pass it over. Actually, back in the 90s, I was in academia and in the odds I was in the startup world and I'd done a couple startups and I was ending one of my startups and I had two sons who were in our local school in California which was a Mandarin immersion school. At this time, there was just a coincidence. Both my wife and I had ended jobs and we said, hey, let's do something crazy right now and let's take this to its extension. Let's go to China and actually put them in a school there. So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor's in Beijing. And he says, I'm going to get you in touch with these guys. So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now and you can explain.

**[14:58] SPEAKER_02:** Well, yeah, and so the VC, who we're still friends with, came up to me and explicitly said, oh, I have this brilliant CTO and he wants to come to China. I'm not sure how serious he is. So don't put all your eggs in this basket. But then we started talking that summer and you were traveling the country so you were in a different place every time.

**[15:25] SPEAKER_01:** Another advantage of us both being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving.

**[15:30] SPEAKER_02:** Around the country. And I remember we were kind of talking over the summer and I was seeing how serious you were about coming. And at one point you said, okay, look, if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job in Beijing. And I went to the school that my kids went to and said, can you make space for two foreign kids in this international program? They said yes, if you can, but the kids have to be here the first day of school. And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation. So I called Jim up and said, look, I can do it. I can guarantee a place for them but you have to be here on this day. And to my shock, he actually said yes. And he parked up his house.

**[16:22] SPEAKER_01:** Everything in the house. I think we had 12 days to be in school and we probably had to have the house packed within less than a week. So that was a crazy week. But Victor was a great help. We were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about. Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything and he knew where the good schools were, he knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously. So, yeah, it was a great experience.

**[16:58] SPEAKER_02:** It was an exciting time to be in China. It was right around the first Olympics. So it was a really exciting time. But yeah, you wound up staying for about 18 months.

**[17:11] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, it was over a year.

**[17:13] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. And then we just kept in touch from there. We loved working together.

**[17:18] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it was a great year. Did you arrive? What was this? Rough time period? Yeah.

**[17:23] SPEAKER_01:** Who are you asking? Because it was different.

**[17:25] SPEAKER_00:** You, Jim.

**[17:26] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, 2011 summer, we're driving all over the country. 2011 September, August, I can't remember. We were in Beijing.

**[17:36] SPEAKER_00:** Gotcha. Gotcha. Very cool. And so then you're back end of 2012 or early 2013, something like that.

**[17:47] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, we were back at. When did we come back? I guess we were back in the country in 2013.

**[17:53] SPEAKER_00:** Gotcha.

**[17:54] SPEAKER_01:** But like January.

**[17:56] SPEAKER_00:** Let me actually, I'll segue. I'm trying to keep it slightly chronological to keep everything in my mind here consistent. So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. I got to start working on Ethereum, kind of purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but basically.

I had passed my qualifying exam. I'm going to say spring 2014 or maybe May, April or May 2014. So for those who have not aware of how PhD programs work, the qualifying exam is like one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis. So it's a whole bunch of study and intense prep at Berkeley. It's a three hour oral exam with a couple people from your department and one from an external department. And then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass, thankfully. It was a I don't know that it was.

Everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good. Right? Like, and so while I passed it, I didn't feel great at least the rest of that day.

**[19:31] SPEAKER_02:** When did you find out the result? Like immediately?

**[19:36] SPEAKER_00:** They put you in the hall and they tell you, yeah, okay, that's good. So you're just very nervous.

**[19:41] SPEAKER_01:** I don't know what it was like for you, but for me it was just like three guys I knew and I was nervous too, but it wasn't like they had to go and calculate numbers or something. They just kind of come out and they're like, yeah, exactly.

**[19:54] SPEAKER_00:** No, it was like that. Right? Yeah, it's a oral. It's subjective in a sense, but there you've got like several of the world's foremost experts in some subjects, so they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research. So anyway, so the qualifying exam led to I needed a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics and I had almost taken a job working for sort of a data science company that was taking, I can't quite remember, something having to do with Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks. I can't remember at this time, but it seemed like an okay thing. I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I'm from New York and as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture and I didn't fully do it. I still I'm prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kind of like it there. But anyway, by the way, yes, Jim's there. I'm in the state of New York at the moment.

**[21:13] SPEAKER_02:** But.

**[21:13] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, but I needed a little break basically. And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project. So somehow my dad, Joe Lubin, got attached to the project basically because he was always tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time. He had a CS background plus the financial background. And ran a hedge fund for a number of years. And so it's just kind of always watching technological innovations in financial services. And I guess always had a little bit of the blockchain philosophical character in that, let's say pro freedom, little bit of a libertarian streak kind of thing. And I believe he happened to just be visiting our families. He's from Toronto. A lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. And he went, I believe, to it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup. But this would have been January, February 2014, I believe. And Vitalik was speaking there. And like everyone around that time where you see Vitalik speak about something, you got really excited, right? And so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away. He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project. And you know, it didn't turn out that way. We can go into it a little bit later. But he started working on it again, let's say February, March 2014. And so he just sent me the white paper right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam, I got a chance to read it and it was pretty cool and interesting and new and that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of the technology and it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etc. And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer basically. So that's how I got into it. And subsequently Jim alluded to this earlier, I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Hsu, great friend of ours, kind of, I don't know, not quite famously brilliant, definitely brilliant, somewhat famous, super cool guy and had been a long time reader of Steve's blog. He's one of the few really excellent kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy, but most people who are really technical in communication have a hard time distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience. But Steve is actually good at that, but with nuanced coverage of technical topics. So anyway, caught up with Steve and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim. And I believe I was the first time I spoke to Steve I was in New York, but was just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe January, sorry, June, July 2014, and maybe I came back in August or something like that. And it turned out that Jim was there in Hayward and we got to meet up. What do you think? August 2014, September, something like that?

**[25:02] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, it was around then because also ironically, I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back.

**[25:12] SPEAKER_02:** That's all your big life changes are related to some cross country trip.

**[25:18] SPEAKER_00:** Soul searching. You do a literal search around the country.

**[25:22] SPEAKER_01:** Well, see, I was in Montana and then I was back in the Bay Area and then we talked.

**[25:27] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, okay, that's cool. How was Montana, by the way?

**[25:31] SPEAKER_01:** Wow.

**[25:32] SPEAKER_00:** Maybe we shouldn't go. Yeah, Montana. Oddly crypto friendly.

**[25:36] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, yeah, makes sense. Big sky country, right? Big sky country.

**[25:42] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, so let me see here. I want to. I have a couple other 2014 anecdotes that you guys may not even know that much about, but maybe we should jump ahead to 2015 and go back.

**[25:58] SPEAKER_02:** Just before we go past 2014, so I moved back from China in 2014. And so me and Jim were talking about what kind of project could we do together? So while you had started that conversation, me and Jim were thinking about maybe we could work on a startup together. And at some point you forwarded me the paper as well. So like, I think that's kind of how I got into it as well.

**[26:30] SPEAKER_00:** I want to give. Yeah, I don't want to speak the whole time, but I have some info here that I forget if I told you guys at length.

**[26:38] SPEAKER_02:** Okay.

**[26:38] SPEAKER_00:** So in 2014, so basically I did work on the Ethereum project through a bunch of 2014. As far as tech projects go, it was much more global, a little more European, but you know, you had Canada, had a bunch of people in Zug, Switzerland, a little bit in Israel. In the early days, we worked out of an office, my dad and I and a guy named Steven Nerayev, who is now kind of famous actually, if you Google the name, you know, it's definitely an interesting and colorful story that I'll go into a little bit, and a guy named Jonathan whose last name I couldn't find when I was writing this down, but Jonathan's a good guy. And I don't know if they kind of parted ways at some point or how that all happened. So we're working in this office in Times Square and really trying to find different ways to advance the project, meeting with lots of people. So that's when I met Steve Hsu, who introduced me to Jim, basically just kind of calling up whoever might be interested. But part of the plans that the Ethereum folks had was they acknowledged that there would be a need for kind of ongoing pure research and then in addition to more like focused R&D to build the network out. And so Vitalik at some point penned an article about 10 hard problems in cryptocurrency or something of that nature in which, and I think it was, if we went back now, it would look both very insightful and a little bit dated. I'm sure some of them have been solved and some of them may not need to be solved because something else emerged. But basically he foresaw the need for privacy above and beyond pseudonymity. For instance, many things with that transition from proof of work to proof of stake or just energy efficient blockchains which people were talking about at that time. But my position in academia at that time seemed to be helpful as the blockchain people were just so different from the academia people. Despite being like, both of them being really smart groups of people, blockchain people were not worried about doing things through the proper channels and approval and writing it up the right way and all that sort of thing. Whereas something about academia makes you fearful of being wrong because you're wrong enough in public, there are kind of consequences for it. And the kind of I would say the tech attitude in general is like getting something out there, get it to work basically, but get it out. And then iterate and blockchain people had that in an extreme. And I would say also Ethereum was much more like that than the Bitcoin culture. The Bitcoin culture was like a bunch of practicing but academic cryptographers who never wanted to change anything. And the Ethereum people were more like have the software, computer science, engineering attitude of like, well, let's get it out there, let's tinker with it, let's kind of see what happens. And there's good arguments for both, especially when you're talking about like a system that records a lot of high value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred. But all that is to say it was useful for the Ethereum foundation to have sort of someone who was actively in academia to kind of work with and coordinate everything. So we agreed to work on a body called the Cryptocurrency Research Group and that was composed of sort of myself, Vitalik and our friend Aaron Wright. He's since gone on to a number of Web3 projects, but at the time was a practicing attorney, but also a professor at Cardozo Law School. And he came to that Times Square office, which was not the greatest of offices, and just sort of really leaned in on Ethereum and kind of helped structure everything so that it would be the most robust. Not just technology, but they actually did quite a good job in figuring out how to set things up that other projects since did certainly not do as good a job, I'll say. So it was funny times.

And in 2014, I also got to go to Zug. For those who don't know, the Ethereum foundation was one of the first to be headquartered in Switzerland. And it's become a very popular choice for crypto foundations because I guess the Ethereum foundation sort of blazed a path. And okay, funny thing about Switzerland is that the kind of local authorities also just seem like business people. Like, they want to land the future tax revenue and employment. And so you can kind of, once Switzerland is split into some number of cantons, which are like states, a little smaller than US States, of course. And so you can kind of go from Canton to Canton and try to get the best offer. And offer really means tax treatment, any kind of grants, or helping get fast answers around legal questions. One of the tough things about the United States is that sometimes you don't know what's allowed. And the Swiss environment, they were fairly clear about what they wanted for the special tax treatment, etc.

So we went out and visited Zug, I don't know, mid late summer 2014. And I got to meet all of the founders of Ethereum at that time. I believe there were kind of eight in total. And so I think those.

**[33:40] SPEAKER_01:** Numbers changed over time, though.

**[33:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, those numbers changed, yes. So.

**[33:44] SPEAKER_01:** Well but.

**[33:44] SPEAKER_00:** But, yeah, I think so. I don't exactly know how all of it happened, but Vitalik, it was always a global project, right? So Vitalik would kind of go around the world and evangelize, get people excited, and they would want to work with the project. And so a bunch of folks got attached to it. And, you know, I think obviously it worked, right? But if he were to do it again, I bet he would be a little bit more careful about adding folks to it, because eight is just too many. Like, if you went to a US venture capitalist with a slide that says eight cofounders, and they're not all currently running billion dollar companies, you'd be just laughed out of the room. And yet it worked, right? It actually functioned. And the way it broke apart was that there were the technical guys. So I think, I don't quite know how this happened but pretty early on, like Gavin Wood, Jeff Wilcke started building out versions of Ethereum, the C and Go clients specifically. We'll go into the client soon because there's good stories there. Vitalik was building the Python client. They were all working together on technical documentation. And the reason that people were building multiple clients was that there was the perception that bitcoin was controlled and centralized because there's only really one definitive client Bitcoin Core. Right. And so there was this huge replication of technical effort. Like each of them eventually got their own teams. There were JavaScript clients, many of them kind of came out later and I'd say the project had sort of tech folks and business folks. Like any tech project didn't really have a nominal CEO at any time. It was closest to being Charles Hoskinson. So I think at the time I went to Zug, the leadership looked like on the business side, Charles is the CEO, Amir Chetrit who really did business development. He's a funny guy. I still see him every once in a while. Joe, my dad and Anthony Di Iorio as the other business guys who probably had the most operating experience. And then the tech side was Vitalik, Jeff Gavin and then Mihai Alisie had sort of done corporate setup. I believe Mihai worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin magazine. So Vitalik, very interesting character where most of the time technical geniuses are not good communicators. And he was sort of a journalist running Bitcoin magazine, writing a lot of the articles. If he started it or kind of joined it and he would crowdfund the articles a bit. Like for, you know, if I can get a pledge of one Bitcoin, I'll write an article about X. And at the time Bitcoin was inexpensive but those values went up. And I think it actually ended up being a good funding mechanism, the articles he wrote in the future and it led him to kind of have a sort of impartial thought leader position in addition to his really strong technical ability and the ideas he was generating, etc. And I know he had joined a bunch of projects early on and helped work with them. Like I think Mastercoin was maybe the first colored coin project. He did some work on that. So anyway, those were the eight at the time and there was a meeting for everyone to kind of get on the same page, remote project. There was a slack. People were maybe working a little bit at cross purposes, lots of infighting. People are stressed, they're trying to deliver on this awesome concept that Vitalik put out there. And then everyone kind of tried to grab ownership of like was there a reason to have all these different clients? In the end, empirically it worked, right? But a little bit of it was an "I want Ethereum to be mine" sort of thing. And I saw this in the room when we were visiting there. So basically it was quite dramatic, the trip.

So on this trip, everyone went outside at some point and people were kind of a little bit sick. The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing to some extent. There's always this tension probably especially early in a company where the tech people are like, what do I need you business guy for? We're going to make this thing and it's going to get out there and the business people have to go raise the money, find sales, find partnerships, etc. And it's subjective stuff that the tech people don't like or sometimes understand. And more or less this happened. People were uncomfortable with promises that Charles was making and just the accusations. I don't really know what was going on at that time. But there was this general sense of frustration with him. He also seems to be in some ways executing well on an effective smart business strategy, but maybe over promising what's possible to the point of bringing people out. And then we've seen later, I think some of the stuff with Cardano was probably at least aggressive, but the jury was not out at that time in my eyes. Amir also was in target because I think people just thought he wasn't doing enough, it sounded like. And so they were both jettisoned from the project in Zug, and I was watching this happen. It's like they had a nice sort of loft that they rented that was the Ethereum dev house in Zug. And I'm watching this happen and it was kind of quite crazy. And then actually they instated two more cofounders, so to speak, right then who jumped on board the project and helped out. It was a fun and kind of crazy trip. Otherwise, we went out in Zurich, some people got in trouble with the cops. I won't add more detail to that, but Zurich's a funny place where in the US we're not used to people drinking on the street. And in Zurich everyone drinks on the street and few people are in the bars. So it was a strange experience. We went on some hikes. It's a very nice part of the world, Switzerland, but plenty of drama. In the early days I remember having a funny conversation with Mihai about like he had this book about swarm behavior and I learned I had a mathematical background. We're talking about the mathematics of swarms and all that sort of thing. But yeah, it felt nascent, intense, but disorganized. They were also grappling with the decision on initially they wanted to have a nonprofit protocol and a for-profit they called it a crypto Google at the time to sort of monetize the nonprofit protocol. And plenty of blockchain companies have gone and done that sort of thing subsequently. But that was also decided at that meeting that they would be all not for profit.

**[42:12] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[42:12] SPEAKER_00:** And people didn't like it. Some folks started talking about Brain Drain. It was a mix. Some people liked it, some didn't. Sort of the threat being like if you don't do this for profit, like I'm going to leave this project kind of thing. And I think everyone sort of went off and did start their own businesses. So it is what it is. But let me pause and see if you guys. Did I tell this whole story to you guys at any point?

**[42:40] SPEAKER_02:** I think you told parts of it and not the entire thing, but yes, I didn't realize the sort of Game of Thrones aspect happened in all of that period, short period of time, you know, that like I knew that all that had happened behind the scenes.

**[42:57] SPEAKER_00:** I think it was going on continually but came to a head in this one meeting, a funny memory. We Bitcoin Suisse was getting off the ground at that time and we met with a guy named Nicholas maybe was the CEO or one of the founders. I just googled it says founder and there's a different CEO now. But he made this funny. He's a nice guy and I think something happened there. I'm not quite sure. He made this funny comment
