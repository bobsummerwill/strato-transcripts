SPEAKER_00: Alrighty, so we're on. Thanks. So my name is Kieran James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James from OzDR and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Blockapps which has been in operation for quite some time. But that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened and so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for, for posterity and here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion. But we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, Kieran produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes. Alrighty, so let's, let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad of bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of 14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. So that said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

SPEAKER_01: Aware is different than like interested. In fact, like, I don't know, I was like, I came from an academic background so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But, but I was like a little bit too above all that, like, oh, that's like a money thing. I'm not interested in that money world. So really, no. Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who is a. An old friend of mine, and that Kieran had been following his blog. And Steve called me up and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing. And so at first I was like, yeah, you know, I'm not interested in all this, this fake money thing. And I went and I read the white paper, and by the end of the white paper, I was, I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about like, like banking or something. This is about incentivization on the Internet. And that drew me in. So. And at that point I. And there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I, I started, like, trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how that. And at the time it was a test net and. And that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there. So, I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, let's. Jim, we'll pick that up. I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological. So, you know, I was 2010, 2011, sounds like. Same time frame for you. I think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era and we'll talk in more detail. But let's, let's hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you want to take it?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was, I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I. I felt really disconnected from North America. So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called Twit that was like all technical podcasts. And one of the podcasts I really love was this podcast Security now, which went really deep into these kind of like, security, technical kind of things and did like a couple episodes of bitcoin and I was like, you know, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like, and even to the point where I downloaded the bitcoin client and ran it. Didn't get any bitcoin, where if I did, I didn't notice it. I wish. I think the Rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this. But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups there'd be like groups of computers in like part of their office. And I was like, what are those for? They're like, oh, we're mining bitcoin. And I was like, oh, like, why are you mining bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, you know, we can like transfer money and like, it's basically free Internet magic money. And I was like, I honestly was kind of repelled by that. Like, that kind of seemed like too nutty even for me at the time.

SPEAKER_01: Did we all hate it before we liked it?

... (rest of the transcript remains the same)

SPEAKER_00: So a couple times now.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly.

SPEAKER_01: It's a funny type of cyclical. Tell you about the time we saw Vitalik threw his shirt at someone.

SPEAKER_00: Oh, that's a good story. Yes, the Vitalik short story is a good one. Alrighty, let's. Let's end it here. Thanks, guys. You know, we're doing this recording on a Sunday. Hope it entertains and informs the wider world. And we'll see you next time.
