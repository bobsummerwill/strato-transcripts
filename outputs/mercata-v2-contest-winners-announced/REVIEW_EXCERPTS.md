**Intermediate:**

> So from Streamyard, are we able to see like people trickling in or. Not really. It doesn't look like it.

**opus:**

> But that's it. Okay, I see some comments. Michael. Hey, Strato Mercado. Appreciate him. Yeah, yeah.

**gemini:**

> (No matching timestamp found in output; likely timestamp regeneration or formatting drift.)

#### [05:25] SPEAKER_01 (block 46/90)

**Intermediate:**

> Exactly. I mean that the content is. I, I mean I, I do think we need to find a way to kind of bring people in. We are going to read some comments today but it's like we'd like to make it more interactive in the future. But it does seem like X does not want to play nice with any multi channel platform.

#### [16:09] SPEAKER_01 (block 68/90)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, I took some big swings because, you know, I want to exert my godlike or Fed chair like power as much as I could. Well, thankfully I didn't go completely power mad, but there were a lot of risks in the system and it was interesting how the system stood up to those risks that eventually, you know, prices started to kind of converge back into the right price.

#### [29:21] SPEAKER_01 (block 90/90)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah and I will say we got some amazing feedback this time both on the repo and privately thanks to everyone that participated provided us that information just for everyone to know. We're going to be at Token. Karen and I will both be at Token 2049 in Singapore next week. If you're around please ping us on telegram. We'd love to get together with you but we won't be having a spaces next week so there will be a week delay from our next basis though we have a lot of to talk about including a short preview. You know Vitalik's announcement that low risk defy is the future of Ethereum and we believe the future of blockchain projects in general. So we'll talk a little bit more about that and maybe a recap of token 2049 at our next basis. Thanks for everyone that's joining. Take care of the truth is out there.

**Intermediate:**

> Can you still hear me? Let's put them back in after a chat. I can. Lock and load. Can you guys confirm we're live on Twitter and YouTube? Actually, how do I join the YouTube one? Okay, I see it live on my laptop. Okay. Can you speak? Yeah. Live testing. Yo, yo. Making sure this works. Can you hear us?

**Intermediate:**

> You know, good. I feel like shark is better than whale. Can sharks eat whales? I don't know. You know, like a blue whale is pretty big. Most whales are big, but there are some smaller, you know, there are some smaller whales. But I think on average, whales are going to be bigger than sharks. Isn't there a whale shark? Maybe you could be a little bit of both. Yeah, a little bit of both.

#### [21:35] SPEAKER_04 (block 20/26)

**Intermediate:**

> And the last comment I'm going to say from Ask Buys, perhaps my most unique decision was to spend time in the higher interest, lower collateral lending pool instead of the low fee pool to increase leverage and have more access to capital at a given health factor while decreasing exposure to single asset price tips.

> simple, barely easy to use, to some extent consumer-protecting, but still fun for the degens out there. Yeah, and I will say we got some amazing feedback this time, both on the repo and privately. Thanks to everyone that participated, provided us that information. Just for everyone to know, we're going to be at Token... Kieran and I will both be at Token... 2049 in Singapore next week. If you're around, please ping us on Telegram. We'd love to get together with you, but we won't be having a Spaces next week. So there will be a week delay from our next Spaces, though we have a lot to talk about, including a short preview. Vitalik's announcement that low-risk DeFi is the future of Ethereum, and we believe the future of blockchain projects in general. So we'll talk a little bit more about that and maybe a recap of Token24 in our next spaces. Thanks for everyone that's joining. Take care. The truth is out there.

#### [17:23] SPEAKER_03 (block 57/75)

**Intermediate:**

> That's right, yeah. It lets you know when to enter versus not. I think a lot of DeFi encourages like, really rapid buying behavior, especially like the launch pads, like pump.fun or whatever. It's just about who gets in there first. And our system is mostly not like that. So we want that spot price there just so people know if there's big divergence, there's profit to be made and there usually shouldn't be a big divergence and get good execution and so on.
