QUALITY ASSESSMENT: MERCATA V2 CONTEST WINNERS ANNOUNCED
================================================================================
Episode: mercata-v2-contest-winners-announced
Generated: December 17, 2025

Supported Combinations: 6 (found) / 12 (expected: 3 transcribers × 4 post-processors)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

IMPORTANT PIPELINE NOTE:
  Post-processing should run on the intermediate *.md transcripts (not *.txt)
  so post-processors can preserve the original timestamps.

KEY FINDINGS:

1) WORD-COUNT RETENTION: 6/6 outputs are within 90–110% of baseline
2) TIMESTAMP PRESERVATION: 1/6 outputs have an exact timestamp count match
3) CRITICAL: 1 outputs show timestamp explosion (likely regenerated timestamps)

RECOMMENDED FOR THIS EPISODE:
  • whisperx-cloud + opus
      - timestamps: 26/26
      - retention: 100.1%

================================================================================
INPUT (INTERMEDIATE) TRANSCRIPTS
================================================================================

Word counts (baseline for retention; computed from the intermediate .md
transcripts with timestamps stripped):
  • mercata-v2-contest-winners-announced_assemblyai.md  4,623 words
  • mercata-v2-contest-winners-announced_whisperx-cloud.md  4,586 words
  • mercata-v2-contest-winners-announced_whisperx.md  4,598 words

Timestamp/header counts in intermediate .md (GROUND TRUTH timing):
  • mercata-v2-contest-winners-announced_assemblyai.md   90 timestamps (90 timestamped headers)
  • mercata-v2-contest-winners-announced_whisperx-cloud.md   26 timestamps (26 timestamped headers)
  • mercata-v2-contest-winners-announced_whisperx.md   76 timestamps (75 timestamped headers)

OUTPUT (POST-PROCESSED) WORD COUNT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Legend:
  retention = output_words / input_words
  timestamps = output timestamp count / input timestamp count

ASSEMBLYAI (input: 4,623 words; 90 timestamps)
  processor     words    retention   timestamps
  gemini      4,647     100.5%   82/90   ⚠
  opus        4,533      98.1%   88/90   ⚠

WHISPERX-CLOUD (input: 4,586 words; 26 timestamps)
  processor     words    retention   timestamps
  gemini      4,611     100.5%   44/26   ⚠ CRITICAL
  opus        4,590     100.1%   26/26

WHISPERX (input: 4,598 words; 76 timestamps)
  processor     words    retention   timestamps
  gemini      4,650     101.1%   75/76   ⚠
  opus        4,642     101.0%   77/76   ⚠

================================================================================
QUALITY FLAGS / REVIEW NOTES
================================================================================

1) Timestamp count changes are the primary red flag
   Any output with far more timestamps than the input is not preserving the
   diarization paragraphing and is likely regenerating timestamps.

   CRITICAL failures observed:
     - whisperx-cloud + gemini: 44 timestamps vs 26 input

RECOMMENDATION:
  • Use intermediate .md files as the canonical timestamped transcript.
  • Use post-processed .txt outputs for corrected wording / readability.

PROJECT IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS (TO REDUCE MANUAL EDITING)
================================================================================

1) Deterministic timestamp preservation (recommended architecture)
   Do NOT ask the model to 'preserve timestamps' in free-form text.
   Instead: parse -> correct text only -> reassemble with original timestamps.

2) Entity constraints + validation
   Reject outputs that introduce new PERSON entities not present in input/allowlist.

3) Validation + auto-retry
   Enforce exact timestamp sequence match, non-decreasing timestamps, and header format.
