**[00:01] SPEAKER_00:** We're live.

**[00:01] SPEAKER_01:** For real.

**[00:03] SPEAKER_02:** We are live.

**[00:04] SPEAKER_03:** Yes, we're live.

**[00:05] SPEAKER_01:** And we're live.

**[00:09] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe this won't be so meaningful for the rest of you, but it is the 5th of November today, which in the UK is a very famous day of the calendar because it's Bonfire Night or Guy Fawkes Night, celebrating the. The burning at the stake, I guess, of Guy Fawkes, who was the guy who tried to. To blow up the Parliament in the mid 17th century.

**[00:43] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, the Viva Vendetta guy.

**[00:47] SPEAKER_00:** Based on that.

**[00:49] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, the poll, right, says remember, Remember right in the first line, right?

**[00:55] SPEAKER_00:** That's right. So basically the deal there was that, I guess annually you had like the king giving the speech in front of the Parliament, you know, so you had like, basically the royalty and all of the elite sitting in the hall. They, like, stuffing barrels of gunpowder underneath, but it was discovered at the last minute. So then there you go. You now have burning of Guy Fawkes in effigy on Bonfire nights to celebrate that it didn't happen. And. Yeah, so you have a, you know, like a doll or whatever. That's. That's the guy that you put on the fire. So, anyway, happy Bonfire Night, everybody.

**[01:44] SPEAKER_03:** Happy Bonfire Night.

**[01:46] SPEAKER_02:** We should probably introduce Michael because he's a special guest.

**[01:50] SPEAKER_01:** Absolutely, yes, I guess he's a guest. I mean, we'll make him a regular, I assume, but.

**[01:58] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[01:58] SPEAKER_03:** See me on the telegram.

**[02:00] SPEAKER_02:** Michael, do you. Do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

**[02:02] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, yeah. I work on the sales side of the team. I'm going to be introducing the app today to you guys and I hope you're excited.

**[02:09] SPEAKER_02:** Well, you work sales, you're a dev, you're a front end dev. You know, like, you do a bunch of different stuff on the team, so.

**[02:16] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[02:16] SPEAKER_00:** Got the moves.

**[02:18] SPEAKER_02:** Yes. Sorry, go ahead.

**[02:21] SPEAKER_00:** Let me just kick off. Hi. Hello, everybody. Welcome, welcome. So we did it. We launched V2. It happened. How does that feel, man?

**[02:34] SPEAKER_01:** I think, Bob, you may not be as tired, you know.

**[02:41] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, he's gone away. Okay. He's. He's frozen. He was filming. Yes, well, there were a lot of sleepless nights and working for weekends. Oh, you are back.

**[02:58] SPEAKER_03:** It was back. It was.

**[03:00] SPEAKER_01:** It was my problem. Okay. Yeah, it started spinning everything for a second and then I. And you all came back. Yeah. Second.

**[03:12] SPEAKER_00:** So how's V2 being live?

**[03:14] SPEAKER_02:** How's that feel?

**[03:16] SPEAKER_01:** Much better than before. You know, it's still.

**[03:21] SPEAKER_02:** You never.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_01:** It's a funny thing. Do you ever feel, like, good for, like a sustained period? Like. I think not, but extremely Happy that it's live. I think it would be maybe interesting for the audience to go into a little bit of like what it is and also like why it took so long. So we, to the end of 2024 we started to realize that there was a lot of demand for defi type features. So Basically Marketplace version 1, or Merkada version 1, if you will, was more NFT ish. We had interesting and exotic things that might be numbered and a breadth of them. So this was. We have carbon offsets trading on there whiskey barrels. Michael moved a lot of collectible shoes through the system. So truly, you know, fairly unique, at least down to like having a serial number or sometimes very unique stuff. So there are occasional one of ones on there. We, we dipped our toes into the art market a little bit with some collabs and also so. And then more financialized stuff too. So the metals in particular being something that we've had for a long time and we kind of saw the most demand for the most financialized items and it sort of led us to realize what people want from this technology. I mean, one way or another know, I think in the course of the company, obviously we did very enterprise stuff a lot in the supply chain and that kind of actually led very naturally to the unique item focus and. But you know, often everything in the blockchain space pulls back to some sort of financialization. And we kind of decided to stop resisting this impulse, you know, as the market seemed to be demanding it. So, so we released the other thing we realized is that in some ways, so you know, say your goal is to tokenize everything. Like you want all manner of real world value to be on chain existing alongside truly digital native assets like Bitcoin eth and so on. What would get the world to do that? And we thought the answer was making liquid trading markets where they didn't exist prior. And that is definitely still part of it. But I think it is more about debt than it is about selling or transacting. Right. And so we kind of On Marketplace version 1 created a mechanism whereby you could borrow against collateral. It was sort of primitively done, but you could do it within the system. And it got great uptake. And then we, we said, all right, like let's just make this stuff a little more defy. And it just turned out that like I. We were not expecting to do a relaunch. In fact, we were bringing folks on through Q1 and Q2 and TVL was rising and you know, etc. More loan volumes and all that. Sort of thing. But we realized that we were hitting the limits of the system pretty quickly and that it would be just, you know, that we needed to at least change some of the way the internals worked. And you know, we, so we did a listing of our gold token with small exchange. Was good experience to work with them, but they had, you know, a hard time dealing with things as, as they are, as they were rather and found that just everyone wants the ERC20 style and that to make the capabilities, you know, sort of show the best of Defi. It was like a huge, huge effort that turned into a full relaunch, which was never the goal at the outset, but you know, happy to be on the other side of it. The system is definitely way better. It's a little bit different. There are some areas where we kind of took a shortcut on version one that made it kind of easy and we've gone and made it say more decentralized now, which is definitely better. But there, there could be like rough edges around it. As a for instance, we often had fixed pricing on Marketplace version 1 or Pure Spot pricing. And we have swap pools now, which is great. And that they let the market determine the price and get third party liquidity in and so forth. But then there's just more variability on the, on the, any given trade execution. And so though these things will all sort of work themselves out over time, but huge effort, it's way better, Way better. But it's, it's. We ended up in more of a different place than I intended at the outset. Let me just, let me throw, throw it over to say Victor just on, on all this.

**[08:56] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I, I think the thing is that really, I think our core insight was really, if you think about how people in the real world really accurate, you know, accumulate wealth, it's really through like small accumulation over time of interest. You know, like think about a savings account, a retiring account, all these things people aren't like day trading constantly. Right. So what we realized is that, you know, it wasn't enough to simply be able to buy new exotic or not even exotic, but tokenized things in the real world, but really to turn those into things that were revenue generating for you individually and earning over time. So it should, you know, you should be able to have multiple ways except for trading to earn things. And we realized that Defi had kind of answered this, but it did it in a way that was too complicated for the vast majority of people to understand. I mean, you know, it was only a year ago that Vitalik Himself was like, someone needs to explain to me where defi yields are coming from. Right. Like if he couldn't understand it, you know, how could the rest of the world kind of get into it? And we wanted to build a system that would allow the rest of the world to really kind of get those defi earning potentials. And you know, I think there were two things that really came out of it. One is that we had to kind of combine the pool of assets to not just be about real world asset, liquid real world assets, which we started with, but we also had to bring in, you know, high quality crypto assets. And then the second thing is that we had to offer different paths of earning. Like you could be able to put some of those assets into liquidity pool that you would lend out to other people and get interest on that you would be able to go into swap pools and see when their prices indifferent. You should be able to earn directly if you put some of your things into a savings account that people could offer. So basically V2 offers all of those paths for users which we're really, really excited about.

**[11:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean the point you were saying about trading specifically Victor, you know, so a stat I've repeatedly said, parroting from a prior project, was that, you know, only about 5% of people who try and day trade actually like make a profit. Yeah, most people are terrible, absolutely terrible at trading because you just end up trading your emotions. Right. And you're just scared at the wrong time and you're not brave at the right time and you just, it's very, very easy to, you know, to put yourself in a worse position. So you know, having passive yield is absolutely, you know, a big need for a huge amount of people.

**[11:59] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. And I was really surprised that even in the crypto world the amount of people that had exposure to defi was relatively small. Like, I mean, you know, and I think people didn't understand that how well established those patterns have gotten. It's funny that, you know, Vitalik has just wok up to this after like last year saying I didn't understand you said, you know, the future of Ethereum is going to be based on low risk defi. Right.

**[12:28] SPEAKER_00:** So that's using Defi themselves now finally.

**[12:32] SPEAKER_02:** Exactly.

**[12:34] SPEAKER_00:** For like 10 years they were just like market dumping to raise funds. And it's like, you know, the thing that's kind of got built here because of Ethereum.

**[12:44] SPEAKER_02:** Well, and the world fundamentally, to Kieran's point, runs on credit. Right, That's. And Defi has really solved the collateralized lending component in a way that is so seamless. Like where else can you get a loan in like minutes? Right. Like it's, it's, it's hard to kind of think of any other place where you could do that in a reliable fashion. And I think it does it in a way that allows it to be much more transparent than say typical financial institutions. Right. So you know, the people that are benefiting from those loans are the other users, which is really exciting I think to us.

**[13:23] SPEAKER_00:** So I mean how, how would you say V2 is different than existing, you know, other big name defi protocols?

**[13:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, it's. So it's very much has a point click philosophy. I think if you look at the app today, which Michael will show you, there are still details bleeding through that we will eventually kind of smooth out as appropriate. You know, you need to, you need the user to know what they're doing but not quite know how it's happening if you will, you know, give, give them the right amount of rope, etc. But it is much easier than other takes on how to do it in my opinion. Like if you, you know, you've got to do sort of the one wallet connect if you use the bridge in Path. So probably easiest way into our system is to take some USDC and mint some of our stable token USD st. You can also go in with ETH for instance and then you'll be granted some vouchers which, which will give you gas on Bridgen. Once that's happened, you're in this sort of pleasant, let's say essentially gas free playground where you point and click like a normal Web2 app. And this philosophy extends further. So at the moment we have just four swap pools set up which we've seeded and others have with some liquidity we want. We'll expand this over time for sure and eventually we'll go to a permissionless listing structure, if you will. The reason we've kept it small to date is just to one, make sure everything is working but give you a little less rope than the other platforms out there. So if you go to Uniswap, for instance, you'll find the top pool is usually the top pool by volume. You can sort it by TBL if you want. And that tends to direct people's attention to whatever is trading right now. And the wildly variable aprs, apys, et cetera kind of encourage an aping in sort of behavior. Our message is kind of more like yeah, get into whichever assets you prefer, maybe borrow conservatively and just kind of Keep accumulating over time basically. And so, you know, it's not quite at a vanguard level, but you know, kind of more of a set it, forget it, be conservative, keep growing attitude that should show through within the system while still having flexibility. So the, yeah, so, and it's, I guess I would say batteries included. There are actually two borrowing paths within the system. So once you have collateral, you can mint our stablecoin at a moderate interest rate and you can then put that into swap pools, you can put that into lending pools, you know, and so on. Or you could just, you know, kind of go into the secondary market which is a little bit more flexible in certain ways. So that would be swapping directly, lending pool, etc. So you know, I think we, we always, we, we don't aspire to the same ends but look at projects like Hyper Liquid where the, it's, it's an Alt L1 which means you've got control over the fees. The latency of the system is very good as compared with most Ethereum stuff. Let's say it's fast confirmations that are irreversible. And that thing, it just gives you the latitude to make the user experience as good as possible, which will be a continual battle. But it's been a real step function change from both our old stuff and what's out there today.

**[17:36] SPEAKER_00:** Well, should we take a look?

**[17:37] SPEAKER_01:** Let's take a look.

**[17:38] SPEAKER_02:** Let's take a look.

**[17:39] SPEAKER_03:** I guess I'm up. All right, Share my screen.

**[17:51] SPEAKER_02:** Okay.

**[17:55] SPEAKER_03:** Okay, everybody see my screen?

**[17:57] SPEAKER_02:** Yes.

**[17:58] SPEAKER_00:** Great.

**[17:58] SPEAKER_03:** So we're going to start with bridging in tokens. There's two ways to do it. The normal bridge. Well first you have to connect your wallet of course using Metamask here. There's two ways to do it if you want to bridge an eth or any kind of like wrap Bitcoin Paxg. I think we have something else forgot. But you bridge it in through this. If you want to bridge in stables I would go through the convert feature that will mint on bridge. So we're going to bridge in usdc. This is the testnet by the way. If you want to try it out, just go to this link. And if you want to get some test USDC AAVE has some test faucets for USDC and USDT but let's bridge in like 100 bucks maybe let's do USDC get USDT bridge it in. Confirm, confirm minting. So I bridged them in before just because this is a bit of a process. But you could also check the Status here takes a while for the. Takes a little bit for the server to update there. But visit earlier when I did that. Completed. So let's just assume that it's already in here.

**[19:11] SPEAKER_02:** We should be clear the delays are not on the Mercado side. Pretty much instantaneous. It's on the, you know, Ethereum sepolia side.

**[19:20] SPEAKER_03:** Yep. So we're going to swap some right now. Let's swap some USDT. Let's do like I don't know, 10. Let's get some ES T swap. And also gas is used through USDST on our app as well. Similar to, similar to hyper liquid actually.

**[19:44] SPEAKER_00:** And what do you pay? What do you pay? What are you paying?

**[19:47] SPEAKER_03:** As normal transaction, it depends on the transactions. But some are $0.01 to $0.03 depending on what it is.

**[19:55] SPEAKER_01:** If it's $0.03, it's probably three transactions in there.

**[19:58] SPEAKER_03:** Yes. Yeah, yeah. Usually like I believe a transfer. No, not a transfer. A bridge in is two transactions, I'm not mistaken.

**[20:10] SPEAKER_01:** Although yes. If you bridge in you get minted vouchers. So the vouchers just give you free transactions one to one with the sense, I suppose. Yep.

**[20:20] SPEAKER_03:** Vouchers you can track here as well. And this cool little, little widget. Anyway, so I swapped some assets and.

**[20:28] SPEAKER_00:** Vouchers just to clarify. So that's kind of a little, A little, A little nice hack of getting past the. Oh my God, I haven't got any, any ether for gas on this chain at this time.

**[20:44] SPEAKER_03:** Right, Exactly.

**[20:46] SPEAKER_02:** It's a, it's a, it's an onboarding thing. Right. Like.

**[20:49] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[20:50] SPEAKER_02:** You know, the one big limitation on love chains, right. Like is you can't even do your first transactions on most of them until you have the native token. Right.

**[20:59] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah.

**[20:59] SPEAKER_02:** Allows us to bring people on without requiring that.

**[21:03] SPEAKER_03:** Yep. So we've done the swaps. We're going to add some liquidity to the.

**[21:07] SPEAKER_02:** Michael, I just want to mention if you can go back to the stock. One really important thing with our system is it allows you to see sort of like the exchange rates internally but also like the global exchange rate. That's where you see the exchange spot right under there. So that's the global. Right. This is something
