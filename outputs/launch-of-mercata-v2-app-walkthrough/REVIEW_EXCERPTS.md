**Intermediate:**

> Yeah. And I was really surprised that even in the crypto world the amount of people that had exposure to defi was relatively small. Like, I mean, you know, and I think people didn't understand that how well established those patterns have gotten. It's funny that, you know, Vitalik has just wok up to this after like last year saying I didn't understand you said, you know, the future of Ethereum is going to be based on low risk defi. Right.

**Intermediate:**

> All right, it's been funny on the, on the live system. So it. For, for those who have used dexes, you find, you know, if there's not that Much liquidity. You can definitely push the price as reported and provided by the decks off of the true market price. And in here we're combining a couple different data sources to get the spot price and that's just coming through an Oracle really here it's just a reminder. The spot price is used for like the health calculations when you borrow and the reason you want to do that is you know someone could do a big trade on the one of the pools and manipulate that price and then liquidate someone or or etc as we.

**Intermediate:**

> We're live for real. We are live, yes. We're live and we're live. So maybe this won't be so meaningful for the rest of you, but it is the 5th of November today, which in the UK is a very famous day of the calendar because it's Bonfire Night or Guy Fawkes Night, celebrating the... burning at the stake i guess of guy fawkes who was the guy who tried to uh to blow up the parliament in uh the mid 17th century oh the viva vandetta guy viva vandetta yeah based on that I mean, the poem says, remember, remember, right in the first line. That's right. So basically the deal there was that I guess annually you had like the king giving the speech in front of the parliament, you know, So you had like basically the royalty and all of the elite sitting in the hall. They like stuffing barrels of gunpowder underneath, but it was discovered at the last minute. So then there you go. You now have a burning of Guy Fawkes in effigy on bonfire nights to celebrate that it didn't happen. And yeah, so you have a doll or whatever that's the guy that you put on the fire. So anyway, happy bonfire night, everybody. Happy bonfire night. We should probably introduce Michael, because he's a special guest. Absolutely, yes. I guess he's a guest. We'll make him a regular, I assume. You guys see me on the telegram. Michael, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

**Intermediate:**

> It's funny that, you know, Vitalik has just woken up to this after, like, last year saying he didn't understand. He said, you know, the future of Ethereum is going to be based on low-risk DeFi, right? Well, the EF are using DeFi themselves now, finally. Exactly. For like 10 years, they were just like market dumping to raise funds. And it's like, you know, the thing that's kind of got built here because of Ethereum? Yeah.

**Intermediate:**

> Anyway, we'll get back to the pool. So these are the lending pools that contribute to the borrow lending, which we'll get to in a little bit, but I can deposit a hundred in here and then I will, it should admit me some M USDST tokens, which is my pool token. That's represented of my, my lending pool contribution. I believe that is in these non earnings right here. I am a good, so let's also contribute some money to the swap pool so you can earn APY. Let's see what looks juicy right now. The silver wow. Silver trains. Looking for my deposit. And we are deposited and we're earning APY.

**Intermediate:**

> And I was just going to add, if you want to try it out now, you can just go to our updated website at stradomercada.com and click launch app. One of the big efforts that we're going to is to improve the UX. So if anyone has any suggestions, please join our Telegram community and send us messages there. We'd love to hear from you. We're actively trying to improve it and achieve our goal of mainstreaming DeFi.

You're lying to me. You're lying to the internet. Children are never frustrating. Never. They're just perfect. They're balls of joy. That's it. Non-stop. Thank you, everyone. Cheers, everyone.
