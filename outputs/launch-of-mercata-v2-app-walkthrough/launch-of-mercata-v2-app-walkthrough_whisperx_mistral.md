**[00:05] SPEAKER_03:** We're live and we're live. So maybe this won't be so meaningful for the rest of you, but it is the 5th of November today, which in the UK is a very famous day of the calendar because it's Bonfire Night or Guy Fawkes Night, celebrating the... burning at the stake, I guess, of Guy Fawkes, who was the guy who tried to blow up the parliament in the mid 17th century. Oh, the V for Vendetta guy. V for Vendetta, so that's based on that.

**[00:49] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, the poem says remember, remember right in the first line.

**[00:54] SPEAKER_03:** That's right. So basically the deal there was that I guess annually you had like the King giving the speech in front of the Parliament. So you had like basically the royalty and all of the elite sitting in the hall. They like stuffing barrels of gunpowder underneath, but it was discovered at the last minute. So then there you go. You now have burning of Guy Fawkes in effigy on bonfire nights to celebrate that it didn't happen. and uh and yeah so you have a you know like a doll or whatever that's that's the guy that you put on the fire so anyway happy happy bonfire night everybody happy bonfire night um we should probably introduce Michael because he's a special guest absolutely yes see i guess he's a guest i mean we'll make him a regular i assume but yeah guys see me on the telegram
