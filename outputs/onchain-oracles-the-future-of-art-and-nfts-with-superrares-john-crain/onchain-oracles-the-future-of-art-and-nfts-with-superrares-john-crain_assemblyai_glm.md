**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, well, we have a special treat for you. Before we get into our regular scheduled content, we are adding a new weekly segment called Strato Spotlight where we highlight the latest and greatest features on Strato. And for this week we have a really special one. Kieren, why don't you announce it?

**[00:23] SPEAKER_01:** Thanks, Victor. So we completed our relaunch onto version 2 a little over a month ago and wanted to monitor the system a little bit to just make sure everything was working well before we turned rewards back on. We have done that as of this Thursday and not been loud about it just yet. We've been testing a little bit internally and it seems all good to go. So Michael will show you a little bit about what I'd call season one of our rewards program. Season one. Season zero was very successful bringing in about 8 million of TVL and we hope to see similar and greater results with the new rewards program. Over to Michael.

**[01:06] SPEAKER_02:** Hi everyone. So I'm introducing the new rewards program. This page will be under the rewards section under the tab. You can find it here. This activities tab shows all the different activities people are doing in order to obtain rewards on the platform. Some are one time such as lending from the borrowing pool here or just like making a contributing liquidity to the swapping pools as this person has done. We're going to start with the CDP mint. Go to advanced. Go to here. We have to first add collateral to the vault. I believe this account has some USD going to deposit it. There you go. Deposited. We can borrow. Just going to borrow. Let's say 100 USD. 100. Oops, sorry, 100 USDST, 91 rather. There you go. Now we borrowed 191 USDST. And that would be accruing rewards as a position. Next we're going to do deposit to lending pool. We have about, let's see, 496. Let's deposit 100 here. Great. Now we're going to do a swap which is a one time position. Let's do 100. Swap assets. And add to liquidity pools. When you add to liquidity pools it is an ongoing position so that every time as long as you leave your funds in the pool you'll be accruing rewards. Turn deposit here.

**[03:42] SPEAKER_03:** Great.

**[03:42] SPEAKER_02:** And now we have the regular borrow functionality. Right now I had deposited I believe 2 ETH earlier so I'm going to just borrow a little bit here. And this will be accruing rewards ongoing also.

**[04:01] SPEAKER_03:** Great.

**[04:02] SPEAKER_02:** Borrowed. Now I just want to show you the my rewards section of the page. We have this claimable section that you can claim at any time. There's no minimum. But this also shows your active positions, such as the lending pool position that we took, lending and borrowing, and any kind of liquidity that you contribute to the swap pools that I'm going to claim here. And it's as simple as that. Back over to you guys.

**[04:32] SPEAKER_00:** Awesome. Thank you, Michael. And we should highlight for everyone: If you look at the activities, there's a long list of activities that you can do to earn Strato points. And also, like if you currently are engaged in one of the activities, for example, if you already have put some into a swapping pool or the lending pool, you have to take it out and put it back in to re-enable rewards for the system. Kieren, anything you want to add?

**[05:05] SPEAKER_01:** Just that this was on testnet. It is live on mainnet. You'll see very slight differences when you do so.

**[05:12] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So thank you everyone. Please start using the reward system. We'd love to give out lots of rewards to you. You know, in kind of preparation to launching our full mainnet and making these rewards tradable in the future. So thank you for tuning in. Hope you use our rewards and tune in for more Strato Spotlight segments in the future. Take care. Okay, we are live and we have a very special episode today. We are talking about the future of art and NFTs. And we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane. Welcome, John Crane.

**[06:00] SPEAKER_03:** Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone. Hey, guys. Thanks for having me.

**[06:04] SPEAKER_00:** John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare. But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple years?

**[06:16] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, sure. So, yeah, my crypto journey started in around 2015, going to the Consensus Hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call there. Yeah, I was. Before that, my background was kind of in art and technology. I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad. And yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were gonna intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading. So, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art. So I doubled down immediately.

**[07:05] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[07:05] SPEAKER_01:** Remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally? Obviously we met there, but like, what was that?

**[07:13] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. No, so I was. I was kind of hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd. Yeah. I had actually met I think John Lilic, which I forgot, but I met him at the like the New York Bitcoin Center. I don't know if you guys remember that.

**[07:29] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I do. Yeah.

**[07:31] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. So I was hanging around and actually I was like, I was super into Counterparty, so I was very much like, Ethereum is too complicated. You know, Vitalik's full of shit, it's not going to work. And then the network launched and I was like, okay, I was wrong. This is actually super cool. I have no problem changing. I was totally wrong. This is amazing. And I was just like Googling Ethereum blockchain hackathon. I was trying to find. Get deeper involved. I was trying to quit my day job and go full time crypto. And so then I think I just googled it and it was like, oh shit, there's this hackathon in two weeks. And I applied with Charles and then. Yeah. Met you guys.

**[08:15] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And to be clear to let everyone know that we were blown away by you and your brother Charles's project and we gave you I think your first job, both of you in Web3, right?

**[08:28] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Exactly. I think the, like the Monday after, I don't like, I. I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full time on BlockApps.

**[08:39] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well, I, we, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**[08:45] SPEAKER_01:** There was like a couple week consulting transition period while, you know.

**[08:50] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I think that's true. Yeah. Maybe it was like we started like hourly, like you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then. Full time. Yeah, so.

**[09:00] SPEAKER_04:** So with Counterparty you, you could have been on Christa Rose Tech.

**[09:04] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, exactly. If only.

**[09:09] SPEAKER_00:** So what inspired SuperRare? I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations. But. What triggered you to kind of create SuperRare, which is for anyone who doesn't know, the first NFT platform really out there.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I, Well, I mean it was super interesting, right? You know, like we were all kind of on the ground floor at the Consensus office or like, you know, at least me and Kieren were hanging out there and like watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because I was like, I remember me and Kieren talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens and like I found it was like super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard is a super simple protocol, very simple code. But the adoption created this massive wealth generation. And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy. It was incredible to see that happen. So then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721 and I saw the CryptoPunks launch. And I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy. If you think about the consumer web, it's all. An image and a title tag and some metadata. It could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs and that I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large. So that got me into NFTs. And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, like, you know, going to the art fairs. I had friends who were, you know, looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the, you know, the business of art. And it just seemed obvious. I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of like truly own digital assets and this is obviously going to apply to digital art. So it's kind of like the marriage of, you know, like my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**[11:22] SPEAKER_00:** And like, what was it like to be at the forefront of like the NFT explosion? Because you guys, like, I, I know for a long time you were building and it was like, oh, you know, like, how's it going? And you know that like no one is really paying attention. And all of a sudden, you know, next day everyone's talking.

**[11:44] SPEAKER_03:** It was absolutely crazy. It was hard to like, it was just like completely surreal the whole time. Like it felt like a dream. Like we, you know, we started in 2018. We were, we tried to raise money. It never really worked. Like by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive and like making more than we were paying ourselves.

**[12:05] SPEAKER_00:** So that's the best situation to possibly be.

**[12:08] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, it was like, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea. So yeah, it was like, you know, it was a grind. It was super volatile. Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life? But yeah, then it just, it just really started. Like, I remember the numbers were like doubling every month for a while. And like, I remember it was October 2020. It was our first million dollar month in volume. And, and I was just like, this is wild. But 12 months ago we were like, all right, so the volume was like $5,000 and we made a couple hundred bucks. Okay. Yeah.

**[12:51] SPEAKER_00:** And were you guys the first self minting NFT platform? I think, like we were trying to talk about that actually.

**[12:59] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, we, yeah, we were the first to come. Like, I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but like we were the first to combine like the minting and the marketplace. So it was like there weren't like great minting tools then. So we started with the minting tool and then we're like, all right, I guess people need a place to sell this. So we'll like, we'll build the marketplace too. And you know, partially just out of necessity because like the tooling
