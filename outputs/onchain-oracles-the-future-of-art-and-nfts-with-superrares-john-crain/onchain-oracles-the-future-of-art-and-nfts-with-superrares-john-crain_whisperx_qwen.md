**[00:01] SPEAKER_03:** Okay, we are live, and we have a very special episode today. We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane. Welcome, John Crane.

**[00:19] SPEAKER_02:** Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone. Good to see you guys. Thanks for having me.

**[00:22] SPEAKER_03:** John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare. But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**[00:35] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, sure. So, my crypto journey started around 2015, going to the Consensus hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call. Before that, my background was in art and technology. I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad. I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were going to intersect more with consumer tech and things beyond just finance and trading. When I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art, so I doubled down immediately.

**[01:24] SPEAKER_04:** Do you remember how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally? Obviously, we met there, but what was that like?

**[01:34] SPEAKER_02:** I was hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd. I had actually met John Lilic—I forgot his last name—but I met him at the New York Bitcoin Center. I don’t know if you guys remember that. Yeah, we do. So I was hanging around, and I was super into Counterparty. I thought Ethereum was too complicated. I was like, “Vitalik’s full of it—it’s not gonna work.” Then the network launched, and I was like, “Okay, I was wrong. This is actually super cool.” I have no problem changing my mind. I was totally wrong—this is amazing. I started Googling “Ethereum blockchain hackathon” to get more involved because I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time into crypto. I just Googled it, saw there was a hackathon in two weeks, applied with Charles, and then met you guys.

**[02:34] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, and to be clear, we were blown away by you and your brother Charles’ project. We gave you, I think, your first job in Web3, right?

**[02:46] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, for sure. Exactly. I think the Monday after, I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**[02:58] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were—

**[03:04] SPEAKER_02:** I remember there was a couple-week consulting transition period while we got to know each other a bit, and then went full-time.

**[03:17] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So with Counterparty, you could have been on Krista Rose tech. Yeah, exactly. If only.

**[03:27] SPEAKER_03:** So what inspired SuperRare? You were our head of product, working on enterprise implementations. What triggered you to create SuperRare, which, for anyone who doesn’t know, was one of the first NFT platforms out there?

**[03:49] SPEAKER_02:** It was super interesting. We were all on the ground floor at the Consensus office—or at least me and Kieren were—and watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating. I remember talking a lot with Kieren about ERC-20 tokens. It was incredible how such a small, simple protocol standard created massive wealth generation. Even with scams, it was net positive for humans and the economy. Then I saw the standards conversations around ERC-721 and the CryptoPunks launch. I thought, “This is pretty crazy.” If you think about the consumer web—it’s just an image, a title tag, and some metadata—maybe the entire consumer web could turn into NFTs. I didn’t know the exact business model, but the total addressable market seemed huge. That got me into NFTs. On the flip side, I was also in the New York art scene, going to art fairs, with friends seeking gallery representation. It seemed obvious: there was now a way to truly own digital assets, and this would clearly apply to digital art. It was the marriage of my tech interests and my passions around art.

**[05:40] SPEAKER_03:** What was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion? You were building for a long time when no one was paying attention, and then suddenly everyone was talking about NFTs.

**[06:02] SPEAKER_02:** It was absolutely crazy—completely surreal the whole time, like a dream. We started in 2018. We tried to raise money, but it never really worked. By the time we raised, we were already cashflow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves.

**[06:24] SPEAKER_03:** That’s the best situation to be in.

**[06:26] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. It was much easier to raise then than when I just had a cool idea. It was a grind—super volatile. Many times I asked myself, “What am I doing with my life?” But then it really started. I remember the numbers were doubling every month for a while. October 2020 was our first million-dollar month in volume. I was like, “This is wild,” because 12 months earlier, volume was $5,000, and we made a couple hundred bucks.

**[07:10] SPEAKER_03:** Were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform?

**[07:17] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, we were the first to combine minting and the marketplace experience. There might have been a couple other minting tools, but we started with the minting tool and then realized people needed a place to sell, so we built the marketplace too—partially out of necessity because the tooling sucked at the time.

**[07:47] SPEAKER_03:** It’s funny—I remember the Flow guys doing CryptoKitties in Vancouver. I was talking to them about running it on our blockchain. One amazing thing you’ve done is the launch of the RARE token. You were one of the first projects committed to figuring out DAO governance in reality. What led to that, and how did it go?

**[08:26] SPEAKER_02:** Early on, I was excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum because users could participate in the network’s upside. There was that “fat protocol” article from 2016. I was thinking about monetization: could you build platforms that are collaborative rather than extractive? Instead of selling ads like Meta, maybe a marketplace business model with collective ownership via a token. I was drinking a lot of the crypto Kool-Aid at the time.

**[09:32] SPEAKER_04:** Did you do it like a classic ICO? Fixed price auction? How did RARE get distributed?

**[09:41] SPEAKER_02:** We actually did a huge airdrop—probably one of our mistakes. We should have sold a bunch of tokens, but we just gave them away. There are plenty of challenges—DAOs are hard to manage and run—but it’s cool to see the current administration change tack and seem interested in building and pushing forward.

**[10:10] SPEAKER_03:** What do you think the biggest challenge was in running a DAO? We all had that ideal of complete decentralization. What challenges did you face, and what remain today?

**[10:32] SPEAKER_02:** Regulatory uncertainty is still a big challenge. You’re trying to read the tea leaves instead of just making the best decision. You ask, “Is this clear? Maybe we should do that instead to avoid trouble.” The position is friendlier now, but there are still no clear rules. We’re past the Gensler era—the dark ages—and Gary’s gonna be turning up for a job somewhere soon.

**[11:15] SPEAKER_03:** Do you have advice?

**[11:23] SPEAKER_04:** Should it be more like a representative democracy—with proposals and delegation? Or maybe just a couple of leaders, but stakeholders can call a confidence vote? Some people like futarchy—MetaDAO is trying that.

**[11:52] SPEAKER_02:** It depends on what you’re doing. For something like Bitcoin or Ethereum—where small changes can have catastrophic impact—that’s one thing. For SuperRare, there’s a low-level protocol and an application layer; stakes are fairly low outside of escrow contracts. I like empowering a team to keep going, with token holders able to say “stop” if things veer off course, rather than approving everything. Voting on button colors is absurd.

**[12:56] SPEAKER_03:** Given you’re a decentralization advocate, how do you balance being a curated platform with openness? SuperRare’s curation keeps quality very high, unlike open marketplaces that list a ton of low-quality work. How do you balance those while staying decentralized?

**[13:38] SPEAKER_02:** It’s challenging—almost a paradox. We’ve always taken a “minimal decentralization” approach: decentralize where it’s useful. Early on, we considered token-holder voting on artists, but I thought that sounded like the most dramatic, terrible thing imaginable—people voting “your art’s terrible.” Good art is subjective.

**[14:20] SPEAKER_03:** I once worked on a dating project where you had to be voted in based on looks—it was horrible. Very evil.

**[14:33] SPEAKER_01:** But there were writing prompts, remember those?

**[14:35] SPEAKER_03:** Yes, or Hot or Not—all just brutal. The art industry can be quite vicious.

**[14:49] SPEAKER_02:** On-chain auctions and escrow make sense. On-chain voting for which artists are good? Let the curators do their thing. If things get out of hand, token holders can raise awareness. Early on, we thought we’d be more open, but as tools emerged, we positioned SuperRare as the ultra-curated view, with other open platforms for anyone to use.

**[15:55] SPEAKER_03:** It’s a two-sided market—artists and buyers. Did you have to get artists first to convince them? How did you approach that?

**[16:13] SPEAKER_02:** You kind of had to get both first. It started with me experimenting and building minting tools. I demoed and talked to people, which first piqued artists’ interest. When we launched, Jason Bailey—an early digital art advocate who runs Club NFT—reached out. He said, “I want to buy this art on Monday on SuperRare.” I looked at Charles and said, “Dude, Jason wants to buy something on mainnet Monday—what can we do?”

**[17:22] SPEAKER_03:** That was it—36 hours. Charles was like, “Yeah, probably.” So we stayed up for 36 hours fixing bugs. I’m getting flashbacks to when Microsoft wanted to launch Blockchain-as-a-Service with us at DevCon 1. Nothing like a good deadline, especially with a major partner that can make or break you.

**[17:49] SPEAKER_02:** Right—and don’t do live demos at the end of that. It gets risky. When we did it, there was a funny React bug. We were screen-sharing the transaction with artist Robbie Barrat and Jason, literally pushing fixes: “Oh, we didn’t expect that. One second—okay, it’s deployed. Reload the page.”

**[18:31] SPEAKER_03:** Lots of cash clearing. I remember that. What do you see as the future of art and NFTs?

**[18:44] SPEAKER_04:** Can I jump in? In DeFi, with the administration clearing the way, there’s pent-up demand for a TradFi-DeFi merger. It’s not all the way there, but the path is visible. Do NFTs remain a distinct asset class forever? You’ve started doing physical sales—does it merge or stay separate?

**[19:29] SPEAKER_03:** Like, does traditional art become NFT art—digital or physical?

**[19:35] SPEAKER_02:** I think the NFT stuff eventually fades into the background. The real breakthrough is cryptographically secure provenance—for physical or digital art. It was more transformative for digital because the token can be the art, creating a liquid asset. Digital art will become part of the contemporary market, and NFTs will serve as certificates of authenticity for high-value objects. The lack of provenance data in art and collectibles is amazing—“There’s a sticker on the back; probably it’s from this gallery.” Tying physical and digital assets feels like a waste of time. If you have the physical piece and custody of the certificate, that’s sufficient. I personally place higher value on physical art that includes an NFT, and I think that trend continues.

**[21:25] SPEAKER_03:** A friend who’s an artist often gets requests for sale prices because someone wants to insure a piece—there’s a whole downstream economy.

**[21:41] SPEAKER_02:** Insurance, appraisal, lending—all need better data. Kieren, you and I have talked about lending. That market is small because there’s poor information. Easier access to provenance could grow it significantly.

**[22:04] SPEAKER_04:** Having run an NFT-style RWA marketplace and moved toward DeFi, I thought people tokenized to sell—but actually, they want to unlock liquidity while holding assets. I don’t want to sell my ETH. At the high end, wealth managers extend credit against a Picasso, but for everyone else, it’s hard. Art tends to sit idle—I used to think that was bad, but maybe it should. Credit markets could make it liquid, which would be super cool. I’m surprised we’re not there yet.

**[23:12] SPEAKER_02:** I think we’re seeing green shoots. NFTs are a great, simple form of digital identity—you can pack anything into the metadata. They’re unique pointers to specific things.

**[23:43] SPEAKER_03:** I love how you frame NFTs as certificates of authenticity. At Sotheby’s, for every major piece, they research provenance from scratch—it’s insane how much work that is each time.

**[24:09] SPEAKER_02:** It’s a high-friction process. Depending on your position, Sotheby’s loves being the keeper of secrets, but that will be disintermediated by technology.

**[24:30] SPEAKER_04:** Are you declaring war on auction houses? What about other high-end physical goods?

**[24:38] SPEAKER_02:** We launched an offline gallery on the Bowery next to the New Museum earlier this year, showing physical and digital art—installations, projections, all sorts. Galleries aren’t doing great business-wise; auction houses are hurting. Everyone’s seeking a more sustainable model.

**[25:17] SPEAKER_04:** Stuff is so illiquid—norm is sitting five to ten years. Feast or famine. Print money, get transactions.

**[25:30] SPEAKER_02:** Just wait—2021, people were buying Picassos on their phones, CryptoPunks, EtherRocks. I remember when EtherRocks’ price exploded—I thought, “This is truly amazing.” Models have to change. The internet made shopping transparent—you price-compare on your phone, scan items, ask AI what something costs. The art world has been an insider’s game: marketed price vs. actual price. That’s slowly unwinding. Pricing will become transparent, with on-chain data. As the market becomes efficient, we’ll have the best tools for the new structure.

**[26:49] SPEAKER_04:** So even the big guys want more liquidity but won’t give up their information advantage.

**[26:51] SPEAKER_02:** Exactly—it’s the classic innovator’s dilemma.

**[27:20] SPEAKER_03:** Some auction houses even offer loans to lock people in longer.

**[27:29] SPEAKER_02:** Christie’s and others are private, so it’s hard to gauge size, but they do offer loans. Someone inherits art, their advisor says, “Don’t sell—take a loan.” It’s a conflict of interest: they appraise and lend against that value. You can’t shop it around—it’s ultra-specialized information.

**[28:07] SPEAKER_03:** Jim, did you want to ask a question? You look like you came off mute.

**[28:11] SPEAKER_00:** It’s a bit off-topic, but what’s been the effect—good or bad—of AI on art and your work?

**[28:23] SPEAKER_02:** For the startup, it’s been great—we have a Slack robot that does tasks. For the art market, it’s also been great. It’s a new tool that unlocks creativity. We have tons of artists using AI, and tons who hate it, thinking it’s the end of creativity. But like digital cameras weren’t the end of photography, AI enables more complex work—you skip grunt work, build immersive worlds, make interactive art. The first piece we sold on SuperRare was generated via GANs with adversarial networks voting on outcomes. It’s inevitable.

**[29:45] SPEAKER_03:** Going back to metadata and certificates—will proving human involvement be valued in art or creation going forward?

**[30:01] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. With content creation accelerating, deepfakes are everywhere. Nobody answers unknown numbers—you only trust certified contacts. Similarly, if content isn’t cryptographically signed, you’ll assume it’s fake because there’s no way to verify.

**[30:48] SPEAKER_01:** Have you seen interest in Bitcoin-side innovations like Ordinals, inscriptions, Stamps, and Runes?

**[31:02] SPEAKER_02:** We’ve done a couple Runes projects with artists. It’s super interesting—art will exist on many blockchains, but Bitcoin and Ethereum, being most secure, have the highest chance of longevity. People really like Ordinals. Early on, investors told us, “Get rid of the wallet—it’s too complicated.” But it’s almost a secret incantation—you learn the terms, get inducted into the club. Ordinals are harder to understand than Ethereum NFTs, but they’re quite popular and will likely stick around.

**[32:04] SPEAKER_01:** Another difference is that Bitcoin NFTs store data on-chain versus Ethereum’s external URLs.

**[32:17] SPEAKER_03:** You mentioned starting a physical gallery—everyone’s talking about bringing real-world assets on-chain, but you’re doing the opposite. Why was a physical gallery a logical next step?

**[32:38] SPEAKER_02:** Partly how the market works—people like gathering. Art looks different in person: on a huge projector, a 10-by-10 CRT wall—it’s transformative. It’s community building, a space to show up, and a way to demonstrate that NFTs aren’t just “nonsense JPEGs” or “EtherRocks 2.0.” We’re telling the story to grow the collector base in this demand-constrained market.

**[33:34] SPEAKER_03:** Beyond art, what’s the next area needing provenance or certificates of authenticity?

**[33:56] SPEAKER_02:** Luxury assets—NFTs cost more to create than a database ID, so customers must demand them. Brokers won’t adopt it willingly—they rely on information advantage. But it makes so much sense it’s hard to imagine it not happening. People are serious about wine NFTs and secondary markets. Trading cards are big—Courtyard is doing great. There’s speculation, but serious collectors get real assets. Watches and handbags are popular too.

**[35:22] SPEAKER_03:** Last question—what are you most excited about in blockchain right now?

**[35:45] SPEAKER_02:** Everything is finally moving on-chain. BlackRock’s putting treasuries on-chain, art’s moving on-chain—it used to be a mantra to feel important, but now it’s actually happening. Real-world and digital assets are coming on-chain, liquidity is increasing, and it’s net positive for everyone. It feels like it’s finally here.

**[36:38] SPEAKER_03:** It’s taken ten years, but we’re still here.

**[36:54] SPEAKER_03:** John, thank you. Where can people find you and learn more?

**[37:08] SPEAKER_02:** On X at @SuperRareJohn and @SuperRare. There’s a show wrapping up at the gallery, and a new XCOPY show on December 10th. If you’re in town, check out Offline by SuperRare.

**[37:34] SPEAKER_03:** Awesome. Thank you for joining us. Take care, everyone.

**[37:39] SPEAKER_02:** Thanks for having me.
