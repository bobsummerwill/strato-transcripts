SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, we have a special treat for you. Before we get into our regular scheduled content, we are adding a new weekly segment called Strato Spotlight where we highlight the latest and greatest features on Strado. And for this week we have a really special one. Karen, why don't you announce it?

SPEAKER_01: Thanks Victor. So we completed our relaunch onto version 2 a little over a month ago. We wanted to monitor the system a bit to make sure everything was working well before we turned rewards back on. We have done that as of this Thursday and haven't been loud about it yet. We've been testing a bit internally and it seems all good to go. So Michael will show you a bit about what I'd call season one of our rewards program. Season zero was very successful, bringing in about 8 million of TVL, and we hope to see similar and greater results with the new rewards program. Over to Michael.

SPEAKER_02: Hi everyone. So I'm introducing the new rewards program. This page will be under the rewards section under the tab. You can find it here. The activities tab shows all the different activities people are doing to obtain rewards on the platform. Some are one time, such as lending from the borrowing pool here or contributing liquidity to the swapping pools as this person has done. We're going to start with the CDP mint. Go to advanced. Go here. We first need to add collateral to the vault. I believe this account has some USD. Going to deposit it. There you go. Deposited. We can borrow. Let's borrow 100 USD. Oops, sorry, 100 USDST 91. There you go. Now we borrowed 191 USDST and that would be accruing rewards as a position. Next, we're going to deposit to the lending pool. We have about 496. Let's deposit 100 here. Great. Now we're going to do a swap, which is a one time position. Let's do 100. Swap assets. And add to liquidity pools. When you add to liquidity pools it is an ongoing position so that every time, as long as you leave your funds in the pool, you'll be accruing rewards. Turn deposit here.

SPEAKER_03: Great.

SPEAKER_02: Now we have the regular borrow functionality. Earlier I deposited 2 ETH so I'm going to borrow a bit here. This will be accruing rewards ongoing as well.

SPEAKER_03: Great.

SPEAKER_02: Borrowed. Now I just want to show you the my rewards section of the page. We have this claimable section that you can claim at any time with no minimum. This also shows your active positions, such as the lending pool position that we took, lending and borrowing, and any liquidity you contribute to the swap pools that I'm going to claim here. It's as simple as that. Back over to you guys.

SPEAKER_00: Awesome. Thank you, Michael. We should highlight for everyone that if you look at the activities, there's a long list of activities you can do to earn Strato points. Also, if you are currently engaged in one of the activities, for example, if you already have funds in a swapping pool or the lending pool, you have to take them out and put them back in to re-enable rewards for the system. Kiran, anything you want to add?

SPEAKER_01: Just that this was on testnet. It is live on mainnet. You'll see very slight differences when you do so.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So thank you everyone. Please start using the reward system. We'd love to give out lots of rewards to you. In preparation for launching our full mainnet and making these rewards tradable in the future, thank you for tuning in. Hope you use our rewards and tune in for more Strato Spotlight segments in the future. Take care.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, we are live and we have a very special episode today. We are talking about the future of art and NFTs. We're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane. Welcome, John Crane.

SPEAKER_03: Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone. Hey, guys. Thanks for having me.

SPEAKER_00: John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare. But do you want to give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple years?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, sure. So my crypto journey started around 2015, going to the Consensus hackathon where I met at least three of the other folks on this call. Before that, my background was in art and technology. I worked in advertising and studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad. I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain would intersect more with consumer tech and things that were a bit past finance and trading. When I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art. So I doubled down immediately.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: How did you hear about the hackathon or Ethereum generally? We met there, but what was that like?

SPEAKER_03: I was hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd. I actually met John Lilick at the New York Bitcoin Center. I was super into Counterparty, so I thought Ethereum was too complicated. I thought Vitalik was full of it. Then the network launched and I realized I was wrong. This was super cool. I had no problem admitting I was wrong. This was amazing. I was Googling Ethereum blockchain hackathon trying to get deeper involved. I wanted to quit my day job and go full-time crypto. I stumbled upon the hackathon in two weeks and applied with Charles. Then I met you guys.

SPEAKER_00: And to be clear, let everyone know that we were blown away by you and your brother Charles's project. We gave you your first job in Web3, right?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly. The Monday after, I immediately quit and started working with you guys full time on BlockApps.

SPEAKER_00: We tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were fantastic.

SPEAKER_01: There was a couple week consulting transition period while we got to know each other.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we started hourly getting to know each other and then went full-time.

SPEAKER_04: So with Counterparty, you could have been on Christa Rose Tech.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly. If only.

SPEAKER_00: What inspired SuperRare? When you were working with us, you became our head of product, working on enterprise implementations. What triggered you to create SuperRare, which was the first NFT platform?

SPEAKER_03: It was super interesting. We were on the ground floor at the Consensus office watching the ICO boom happen. Kieran and I talked a lot about ERC-20 tokens. It was fascinating how a simple protocol created massive wealth generation, even with scams. I'd say it was generally net positive for humans and the economy. Then I saw ERC-721 and CryptoPunks and realized NFTs could transform the consumer web. I thought NFTs could be the backbone of the consumer web. The total addressable market was massive. I was also immersed in the New York art scene, seeing artists struggle for gallery representation. It was obvious that NFTs could revolutionize digital art ownership. It combined my tech interests with my passion for art.

SPEAKER_00: What was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion? You were building for a long time with little attention, and then suddenly everyone was talking about NFTs.

SPEAKER_03: It was surreal, like a dream. We started in 2018, tried to raise money, but it never really worked. By the time we raised, we were already cash flow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves.

SPEAKER_00: That's the best situation to be in.

SPEAKER_03: It was easier to raise then. It was a grind, super volatile, and there were times I questioned what I was doing with my life. Then it just took off. The numbers were doubling every month. In October 2020, we had our first million dollar month in volume. It was wild. A year before, the volume was $5,000, and we made a couple hundred bucks.

SPEAKER_00: Were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform?

SPEAKER_03: Yes, we were the first to combine minting and the marketplace. There were a few minting tools, but we built both out of necessity because the tooling was poor at the time.

SPEAKER_00: It's funny because I remember talking to the CryptoKitties team about running it on our blockchain at the time.

SPEAKER_03: Early on, I was excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum because of how users of the networks could participate in their upside. The Fat Protocol article in 2016 was influential for me. I thought about monetization and building collaborative rather than extractive platforms. NFTs were a simple digital identity for collecting ownership. I was drinking the crypto Kool-Aid.

SPEAKER_01: Did you do a classic ICO style launch? How did the RARE token get started?

SPEAKER_03: We actually did a huge airdrop, which was probably a mistake. We should have sold tokens, but we gave them away instead. DAOs are hard to manage, but it's cool to see the current administration pushing forward.

SPEAKER_00: What were the biggest challenges in running a DAO? Decentralized governance was an ideal state for crypto, but what challenges did you face?

SPEAKER_03: Regulatory uncertainty was a big challenge. You had to read the tea leaves rather than making straightforward decisions. The position is friendlier now, but the rules are still unclear. The SEC's approach is still hostile to experimentation.

SPEAKER_04: Gary's going to be turning up for a job somewhere soon, isn't he?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, man.

SPEAKER_01: Do you think DAOs should be more like representative democracies? Should they pass bills?

SPEAKER_03: It depends on what you're doing. Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't DAOs, but small changes can have catastrophic impacts. SuperRare has low stakes, so empowering a team to make decisions makes more sense than voting on trivial matters.

SPEAKER_00: How do you balance being a curated platform with decentralization? SuperRare keeps quality very high, unlike many NFT marketplaces that have a lot of low-quality content.

SPEAKER_03: We took a minimal decentralization approach, decentralizing where useful. Early on, we thought about token holders voting on artists, but that sounded terrible. It would be like people voting "your art sucks." It's not a good idea.

SPEAKER_01: During the Pump.fun streamer heyday, community voting might have worked.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly. Live voting on whether art is good or bad sounds terrible.

SPEAKER_01: Watch this artist threaten to commit suicide.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly. Live voting on whether art is good or bad sounds terrible.

SPEAKER_01: Watch this artist threaten to commit suicide.

SPEAKER_00: I started a dating project where people had to get voted in based on looks. It was very evil.

SPEAKER_04: Remember those Hot or Not sites?

SPEAKER_00: Yes. Hot or Not and all those were brutal.

SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Especially in the art world, which can be quite vicious.

SPEAKER_03: It's challenging because art is subjective. On-chain auctions make sense, but on-chain voting for artists doesn't. Token holders can raise awareness if things get out of hand.

SPEAKER_00: How do you attract both artists and buyers to SuperRare? Did you have to get artists first?

SPEAKER_03: We started with artists. We demos to them, explaining how it worked. Jason Bailey from ClubNFT was an early advocate. He urged us to launch SuperRare quickly so he could buy art on the platform.

SPEAKER_00: That reminds me of when Microsoft wanted to launch blockchain-as-a-service at DEFCON.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly. There are many parallels. Tight deadlines and major partners can make or break you.

SPEAKER_00: Yes. Live demos can get risky.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. We had a funny bug with React during our live demo. We were pushing fixes while screen sharing.

SPEAKER_00: What do you see as the future of art and NFTs?

SPEAKER_01: What do you think about NFTs blending with traditional finance like Defi? Do you think NFTs will stay a distinct asset class forever?

SPEAKER_03: NFTs will eventually fade into the background. The real breakthrough is cryptographically secure provenance for physical and digital art. NFTs will become part of the market, used for both digital and physical art.

SPEAKER_00: Right. A friend of mine recently needed to know the value of her art for insurance purposes.

SPEAKER_03: The lending market for art assets is small due to lack of provenance information. Better provenance could grow the lending market significantly.

SPEAKER_01: People tokenize to unlock liquidity rather than to sell. Selling is one way, but many prefer to hold their assets.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: At the high end of the market, wealth managers extend credit against Picasso's paintings.

SPEAKER_03: Right.

SPEAKER_01: Credit markets could make art assets more liquid.

SPEAKER_03: We're seeing the green shoots of what's possible. NFTs are digital identities. They're simple packets of metadata pointing to specific things.

SPEAKER_00: Exactly.

SPEAKER_01: NFTs work as certificates of authenticity because auction houses have to research provenance from scratch for every piece.

SPEAKER_03: Transactions are high friction. Sotheby's likes being the keeper of secrets, but that will be disintermediated with technology.

SPEAKER_01: Do you want to declare war on auction houses?

SPEAKER_03: We opened a gallery on the Bowery next to the New Museum. We're showing physical and digital art, installations, projections, and more. The gallery scene and auction houses are struggling. Everyone is looking for sustainable models. Illiquidity is a problem.

SPEAKER_01: Stuff sits in galleries for years, waiting for buyers. Feast or famine.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. The models need to change. The Internet has transformed shopping. Price comparison is easy. Physical art markets are inefficient and opaque. NFTs will make pricing transparent and market structure more efficient.

SPEAKER_01: Auction houses want liquidity but are unwilling to let go of their proprietary information advantage.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly. It's the classic innovator's dilemma. You'll have more liquidity with better access to information, but existing power brokers resist change.

SPEAKER_01: The innovators dilemma.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: Auction houses offer loans to lock people up even longer.

SPEAKER_03: Right. Inherited art is often leveraged with loans. Sellers are advised not to sell but to take loans against art.

SPEAKER_00: That seems like a conflict of interest.

SPEAKER_03: Yes, it's one-sided and ultra-specialized information.

SPEAKER_00: Jim, did you have a question?

SPEAKER_02: What has been the effect of AI on art and SuperRare?

SPEAKER_03: AI has been great for us. We have a bot on Slack doing work for us. In the art market, AI is a new creative tool. Many artists use AI, while others hate it. AI enables world building and interactive art. The first art we sold on SuperRare was generated with GANs, adversarial networks voting on outcomes.

SPEAKER_00: Do you think proving art was created by humans will be valued in the future?

SPEAKER_03: Yes. If content isn't cryptographically signed, people will assume it's fake. Fraud is easy with AI, so provenance is essential.

SPEAKER_00: Exactly

SPEAKER_03: There's no other way to know.

SPEAKER_04: Have you seen interest in Bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions?

SPEAKER_03: People like ordinals because they're harder to understand than Ethereum NFTs. There's a secret incantation vibe to it. Ordinals will be around for a while.

SPEAKER_04: Ordinals carry data on-chain rather than referencing an external URL.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: Why did SuperRare open a physical gallery?

SPEAKER_03: Part of the art market is physical. Art looks better in person than on a phone. A gallery builds community and offers space for artists to showcase their work.

SPEAKER_00: Where do you see NFTs expanding next for provenance?

SPEAKER_03: Luxury assets will adopt NFTs. Wine, watches, trading cards, and handbags are already starting. NFTs add provenance and unlock liquidity for high-value objects.

SPEAKER_00: Handbags are a big one.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly. Trading cards are popular now. Courtyard is doing great. NFTs offer speculative appeal and provenance for collectors.

SPEAKER_00: What excites you most in blockchain right now?

SPEAKER_03: Everything is moving on-chain. BlackRock putting treasuries on-chain with partners, art moving on-chain. Real world assets, digital assets, everything is moving on-chain. Liquidity is increasing. It's finally happening.

SPEAKER_00: It took 10 years, but we're still here.

SPEAKER_01: We can make a thumbnail: "the rock is happening."

SPEAKER_03: Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: We need the mission accomplished banner.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah.

SPEAKER_04: Oh my goodness.

SPEAKER_00: John, thank you for your time. We're glad you're doing so well. Where can people find you?

SPEAKER_03: On Twitter: SuperRareJohn and SuperRare. Our gallery is SuperRare Offline on the Bowery next to the New Museum.

SPEAKER_01: SuperRare Offline.

SPEAKER_03: Offline by SuperRare.

SPEAKER_01: Offline by SuperRare.

SPEAKER_00: Awesome. Thank you for joining us. Take care, everyone. Thank you.

SPEAKER_03: Thanks for having me.
