#### [00:02] SPEAKER_00 (block 1/138)

**Intermediate:**

> Okay, well, we have a special treat for you. Before we get into our regular scheduled content, we are adding a new weekly segment called Strato Spotlight where we highlight the latest and greatest features on Strado. And for this week we have a really special one. Karen, why don't you announce it?

#### [14:08] SPEAKER_03 (block 35/138)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, I mean, early on I was like part of what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where the users of the networks also participate in upside of the network. There's. The fat protocol article. That was super popular 2016. So just thinking about, okay, what does monetization look like and can you build platforms that are. More collaborative than extractive, where it's like if you're meta, you're just like, I'm just going to extract as much metadata and sell ads, which is a great business. But partially for me it was almost like a thought experiment of is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads? And it could be, maybe it's a marketplace as the business model and then it's like collective ownership via the token. So yeah, I was, you know, drink drinking a lot of the crypto Kool Aid at the time. Still am, yeah. To be, yeah.

#### [24:27] SPEAKER_01 (block 70/138)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, please take a take on it. So in defy, we're starting to see like as the administration has cleared the way to some extent, it seems like there was a pent up demand for something like a TRADFI defi merger. It's not all the way there yet, but it's getting to just be fi. Like I see the path to that happening. Do you think NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever? I know maybe you could talk about your gallery. I know you started to do a lot of physical sales.

Before we get into our regular scheduled content, we are adding a new weekly segment called Strato Spotlight, where we highlight the latest and greatest features on Strato. And for this week, we have a really special one. Kieran, why don't you announce it? Thanks, Victor. So we completed our relaunch onto version 2 a little over a month ago.

#### [09:30] SPEAKER_01 (block 11/41)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, I, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right? You know, like we were all kind of on the ground floor at the consensus office or like, you know, at least me and Kieran are hanging out there and like watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating. Cause I was like, I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC 20 tokens and like, I found it was like super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard is a super simple protocol, very simple code. But like the adoption created this, you know, there's massive wealth generation. And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans in the economy. Like it was like incredible to see that happen. And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC721 and I saw the CryptoPunks launch and I was like, well, this is pretty crazy. If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata. It could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs and that I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large. So that got me into NFTs. And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, like going to the art fairs. I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art. And it's just seemed obvious. I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of like truly own digital assets. And this is obviously going to apply to digital art. So it's kind of like the marriage of, you know, like my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

**Intermediate:**

> Very, very evil, you know. But there's right now 10 pages, remember those? Yes, yes, or Hot or Not or all of those. Oh, yeah, yeah. It's, yeah, just brutal. But, yeah, especially in places, you know, the art industry can be quite vicious, right?

#### [30:54] SPEAKER_04 (block 31/41)

**Intermediate:**

> I think everyone's trying to find a more sustainable model and. Stuff is so illiquid, right? I don't mean to interrupt, right? It's just enormous stuff sitting five years, 10 years, you know, and it's feast or famine. Like if we print a bunch of money, probably get a bunch of transactions. Yeah. Just wait. Yeah. Like 2021 people were just, you know, you know, buying Picasso's on their phones and crazy ape.

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, you should also, there's currently a show at the gallery that's wrapping up, but we have a new, there's an ex-copy show December 10th. So if anyone's in town, switch through. You said an annual gallery one more time? I missed it. Oh yeah, offline by SuperRare. Offline by SuperRare. Well, awesome. Thank you for joining us and take care, everyone. Thank you. Thanks for having me.
