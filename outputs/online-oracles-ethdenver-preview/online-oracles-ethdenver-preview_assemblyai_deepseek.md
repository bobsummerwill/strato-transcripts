**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** You are live. We are live.

**[00:05] SPEAKER_01:** Hello.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_00:** Hello and welcome everybody.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_01:** Hello.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_00:** Hello. It's the week before F Denver, one of the major events of the Ethereum calendar, basically like the regional event for North America. So that's coming up. So yeah, as well as the usual Strato crew, we have Colin De Picker here. Is that how you pronounce your surname?

**[00:33] SPEAKER_02:** Colin?

**[00:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's correct. That's my name. Hi everyone. So yeah, Colin is my actual name. Most people know me under the name of Shiva Tarzan, which is like the crypto name I use. But yeah, my actual name is Colin.

**[00:46] SPEAKER_00:** So sometimes Shiba Tarzan, sometimes Crypto Tarzan.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_01:** So the Twitter handle is Cryptotarzan. I mean, that was my name that I chose when I initially joined the space, and then when we did our like ENS thing with Boo, then I had to come up with an original ENS name and then it became Shiba Tarzan. I don't know how but I came up with it. So I think it's quite funny if you think about the meme.

**[01:13] SPEAKER_00:** Guess it sticks forever like Victor's vic.

**[01:19] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, probably is going to be the heritage handles story. So yeah, we're here. Myself, Bob Sunwell, Head of ecosystem. Kieren James Lubin, CEO Victor Wong CPO. And Michael Tan who has got a little demo for us which we're going to start with.

**[01:48] SPEAKER_02:** Sure.

**[01:48] SPEAKER_03:** Hey everyone. So back here with another demo of Strato. For the last week and week and a half going forward, we're going to have. We're currently in a trading and referral contest which I'll be showing you an update on. Let's start with that sec. So right now our top gainer is anonymously. 10210 d 28 f 4 percent gain. Not very much. So everyone's got a chance if you would like to have a late entry in. As for the referral contest, we currently have 3 by this user in our community. A couple referrals here. We're also going to be talking about the vault that we've added as of last Friday. Let me show you that. So this is the current position of all positions I have on mainnet deposit 144.96 of Gold. And I'm currently earned 1.84. But let's do a little demo on the testnet. Make my first deposit here. This account currently has USDST and silver.

**[03:08] SPEAKER_00:** Oh no silver.

**[03:11] SPEAKER_03:** Let's put five USDST Confirm deposit. Still pausing. Successfully deposited. Great. So if you click this link you can see what tokens are currently in the vault. It's a market making vault that just kind of rebalances the pools and we give everybody an opportunity to participate. And some of the APY on the mainnet is currently 102.67 which is great. Can also find recent activities of swaps by the vault here. And this is all done with our automated market making bot which you can actually find a blog about on our website. And if you ever want to withdraw you just hit the withdrawal and there you have it.

**[04:02] SPEAKER_02:** Hear me?

**[04:04] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah.

**[04:04] SPEAKER_02:** Jumping on the bot quickly. So the APY obviously phenomenally high. As the assets go up it will probably not be as phenomenally high. It is measuring the true change in underlying asset value. So theoretically all the trades are profitable. Or it doesn't do them. So then the risk is sort of inventory risk right. Like it still has to hold ETH and so on but it is up in absolute terms. And when you deposit to it it's sort of one asset at a time mark the market. So if you got some gold tokenized, you deposit that, you've got some ETH, you deposit that and so on. But you can't just pick and choose on the withdrawal. So you just get a sort of pro rata share of the bots assets on withdrawal which hopefully have increased. But just so you know. So if you deposit and then you're confused when you get a basket of assets back. That's the why. But yeah the APY is very high at the moment. We're excited about it.

**[05:11] SPEAKER_03:** Everyone take advantage now where you can.

**[05:18] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, well thank you. I guess we'll move on to Danba. Want to hang around Mike? You coming to Denver?

**[05:26] SPEAKER_03:** Yes. I'm arriving Monday night.

**[05:30] SPEAKER_00:** Excellent. So I was trying, I was counting how many times I've been to ETH Denver and I think 2009 was my first. So I think this is maybe my fifth or my fourth. Anyone else?

**[05:46] SPEAKER_02:** Veterans moved down though I went early and then I sort of. We had a few years where we just skipped it in our enterprise days. But I think we went and sponsored in 2017 actually. So it was still kind of had like an organic feel to it. I think it still does. I mean it's one of the unique ones where by the way. Okay, so how are the tickets done? I know we've dealt with it at a corporate level but it's a free event. Right? But yeah. Is it like a lottery? Like how do you.

**[06:24] SPEAKER_00:** No, it's a bit weird.

**[06:26] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[06:27] SPEAKER_00:** So you can go for free right? That's kind of a key thing. You know it started out very hackathon-y. So it's always been grassroots volunteers. No ticket prices for normies. But you have to join the Spork DAO for your free ticket so you have to do this onboarding. At least now I think you don't actually have to use a wallet. You used to in some prior years. There seems to be a web 2.0 onboarding kind of flow gas list that gets you there. But there's quite a few screens of stuff to click through that's for sure. Or you can just pay.

**[07:25] SPEAKER_02:** Um.

**[07:26] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, so I mean I don't know what the numbers are going to be this year. Probably around 20000 from what I understand. That seems to be the case last time. How about yourself, Victor? Have been.

**[07:43] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, like Kieren, I was there early and then I think I went again. My first kind of kickstart is the words last year.

**[07:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right?

**[07:56] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. Now we're going back again so.

**[07:58] SPEAKER_00:** And I know it's your first time, Colin.

**[08:01] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, for me it's going to be the first time. I started actually going last year to a youth event so this is the first time that there is an opportunity for me to go to Denver. So yeah, I'm excited. I heard a lot of different opinions. People say it's great. Other people say it's changed over the years and it's a bit more marketing related and less core Ethereum stuff. But yeah, I'm gonna try to experience it for myself and see what it's all about. I mean like I said 20,000 people is still a big audience. It's the only major US event I think there is in the year, so yeah, I'm quite excited to explore it. I think it's going to be great. Also they changed the format from what I heard. Maybe Bob, you can explain a bit on what changed there. And if it's going to have an impact on the previous years. But yeah, I'm quite excited for my first time.

**[08:54] SPEAKER_00:** Have you been before Mark? Have you been before Mike?

**[09:00] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, sorry, yeah, I was there last year with you.

**[09:03] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yes. And that was your first.

**[09:06] SPEAKER_03:** Yes, that was my first.

**[09:07] SPEAKER_00:** There we go.

**[09:09] SPEAKER_04:** So.

**[09:10] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, I mean, Colin, you were at FCC last year. I think yes, they're fairly comparable sizes. I kind of think of FCC as the European one and ETH Denver as the North America one. Kind of similar. Is size different?

**[09:31] SPEAKER_01:** FCC just had a lot of side events. The main event tickets were super pricey. I think it was €500 for a ticket. Many developers just came to Ken and then they went to all the side events to get the free drinks, the free food, and try to connect somewhere, try to get a job. I spoke to many people at FCC that were actually trying to get a job into the crypto space and they said, oh yeah, the main event is too expensive. So that's why I think there were so many side events at FCC. For the location, Ken is not that big. Bob, you explored it. Compared to a city like Denver, it's super small. And then I mean there were so many side events was just incredible.

**[10:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I think it's become the curse of the major events. They kind of become a meeting point. If you're there, people will be there. So they become a, are you going to be there? And it's kind of not so tied even to the main event. It's just, are you physically going to be in that place on those days?

**[10:45] SPEAKER_02:** Yes.

**[10:46] SPEAKER_00:** Great. Where are you going to be? What are you going to be doing? I don't know. There's all these different side events. Just sign up for 100 things and see what.

**[10:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[10:57] SPEAKER_00:** What you get and see where people are. They can be very fragmented. My understanding of the move to Cannes was partly to try and counter that because at least it's a physically smaller place. So the side events have to be closer together so you're not so fragmented. When I went to SEC the prior year in Brussels, I felt that was very fragmented. That was kind of a really bad year that they had to react to. It has been a criticism of ETH Denver as well. One thing I've seen that's happening in ETH Denver this year, like happened in DevConnect, lots of things under the same roof. There seems to be a push to that kind of thing. Of saying, well, we're going to get lots of threads under that same banner. Come to the main site and stay. There's enough going on that you don't have to leave. You've got these different threads happening.

**[12:18] SPEAKER_04:** Well, I think one of the challenges that ETH Denver has, and I kind of felt this at DevConnect this year, is that the event itself is in the middle of nowhere. So you gotta make a call between. A lot of the side events are downtown. So you gotta make a call of, do I say downtown or do I go out there? And it kind of depends on who you're meeting. Sometimes it just makes more sense to stay downtown.

**[12:44] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Have a day here. A day in the middle, a day on the other side.

**[12:50] SPEAKER_04:** There's no middle. That's the problem. You just gotta go one or the other. I tried a Bird scooter for the first time last year trying to shuttle myself and that was terrifying. I'll never do that again. I'm way too old for that.

**[13:09] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I went on a Lime scooter thing in Austin one time and it was like, this is so dangerous.

**[13:19] SPEAKER_02:** In Austin.

**[13:20] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.

**[13:20] SPEAKER_00:** Wow. Okay. That's just like a rattly crappy bit of road at the side. No helmet. Just like, this is bad. One of the things I saw as part of our sponsorship, which was quite interesting at ETH Denver, is they actually have a condition in there to be a sponsor of the main event. That you have to promise not to have a competing event during core hours. I thought that was quite interesting. Right, yeah, you want to be in the gang. No straight competition. Because that's a real killer thing. Side events used to be in the evening, days before, days after, and now it's just. No, we're just like, we're having our main conference on exactly the same day as you. Just straight competition. It's funny how the norms have changed. Victor, you talked about that with regards to Ripple and consensus.

**[14:21] SPEAKER_04:** Oh, no, it was Cybos Toronto.

**[14:23] SPEAKER_00:** Cybos.

**[14:26] SPEAKER_04:** Yes, they got booted out. And then they made their parallel conference later though. Their parallel conference had.

**[14:35] SPEAKER_00:** And this was a few short years ago, but very amazing and controversial at the time that you would dare to have some competing content in the same city at the same time.

**[14:48] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, the big thing was they had these giant Ripple buses in front that ferried you to. So it was just like, yeah, you know, in the days when they saw Blockchain as direct competitor to Swift, I think that ship has sailed. I think it definitely is a competitor.

**[15:12] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Talking about the corporate thing that you were mentioning there, Colin. There has been some criticism of ETH Denver specifically for having headline sponsors that are Ethereum killers in quotes. Yeah, so it's like, how dare you have whatever, like Polkadot as a primary sponsor or BNB or Cosmos or what have you. But they've always had a line. So it's not like we had a token where you've got Tron everywhere pasted all over the shop. That's not happening. And you're not seeing like Bitboy as a main speaker has happened in Blockchain Futurist in Toronto. So there is a line which I think is sort of been Ethereum and friends with a number of those friends having become L2s or EVM support over time. Anyway, so it's kind of like a big Ten vision. But also saying that sponsorship is key for keeping the tickets free for normal people, which is.

**[16:46] SPEAKER_04:** Well, now that Vitalik doesn't like L2s. Do we still have that? Are they out of the ten?

**[16:54] SPEAKER_02:** There we go.

**[16:58] SPEAKER_04:** Yes, exactly.

**[17:00] SPEAKER_01:** Like.

**[17:00] SPEAKER_04:** Well, the other thing that's a little bit different, Colin, about ETH Denver, it's like you have the hardcore dev conferences, DevConnect, Devcon, and then you have what I call the commercial conferences, you know, Consensus, Token2049. But ETH Denver is kind of in the middle. I think they try to be the culture conference, but it's a little bit of both.

**[17:24] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think also DevConnect is almost fully organized by the Ethereum Foundation. They have a full DevConnect team for it. So that kind of makes sense. But from what I spoke to a few guys of the app lately, they say they have been making their way more into ETH Denver this year than they did before. There is going to be an Ethereum Foundation day. There's going to be a full day for them. They have a whole section this time. So like you say, I think what you say, Victor, is a bit in the middle this time. And absolutely. On other events, like Token Dubai, Token Singapore, that's even more to the commercial side. You won't see much of the core principles. I think ETH Denver is a bit in the middle, but I see still a lot of chances and opportunities. It is still the biggest US event. 20,000 people coming there. It's a big audience. There's a lot of chances for them.

**[18:27] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. And Kieren, in the past, I think the first time we went there were a couple hundred people. And then next year it got huge quick.

**[18:38] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, it felt familiar. And it was very Denver. Like down the street from the dispensaries. Kombucha on tap. I assume that maybe still is there, but yeah, it had a kind of hippie agora feel to it, which maybe it still does. We're gonna see.

**[19:01] SPEAKER_00:** Sports Palace was a cool building. Apparently it had the setup it had because it used to be a car warehouse place. That's why.

**[19:16] SPEAKER_04:** Interesting.

**[19:17] SPEAKER_00:** But you just had this multi level thing with ramps going up and round it and some of them were talks and stuff. But yeah, it was only a few hundred.

**[19:30] SPEAKER_02:** I might be getting this wrong but I remember the venue has changed again at some point. It was like a rodeo, right?

**[19:39] SPEAKER_00:** No, it's the same venue but a different building on that same complex.

**[19:43] SPEAKER_02:** I see.

**[19:44] SPEAKER_04:** Gotcha.

**[19:45] SPEAKER_02:** I remember catching up with John some years ago and he was telling me the legacy had to go to deal with the amount of people who wanted to come which was pretty extreme. Like renting out a stadium. Which is pretty funny to me.

**[20:02] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it's certainly a pretty major undertaking there. There has always been a large cultural and artsy part to it as well. The thing I've been mainly involved with there is the Museum of Ethereum. When you come into the venue you go through the main ticketing. There is going to be an area which is called Biddle Alley New Biddle City which is kind of a Blade Runnery Futurescape somewhere like Meow Wolf or Harry Potter Diagon Alley vibes of going through this area and there are going to be various sub areas and zones in there. One of the large ones is the Museum of Ethereum which we are sponsoring as our Golem of DEVCON 0 presentation. Age and then ourselves DEFCON 1 era. Super OGs still going. It's a mixture of physical and digital artifacts drawing largely from the early days of Ethereum, bios and interviews and everything. Also some photos through 2014 largely from Taylor Goering, also some of them from the Toronto Bitcoin Expo in April 2014. The other thing I've been working on for that which I think is really cool is the Ethereum Time Machine. What I'm providing there is an authentic experience of running original software. I have got two 2010 era white plastic MacBooks and two chunky ThinkPads. I was trying to get back to Frontier Software. I can run Frontier Software. However the second phase is actually mining. The goal I had is can you run 2015 era software on contemporary hardware? CPU mine the chain back to life. That's what I've been working on in the background for a couple of months. Basically GPUs at first get the thing moving and then as it's moving the difficulties coming down and you're easing off. So I'm in the final phases of that. I wanted to revive Frontier. Sadly that's a very expensive proposition that maybe some other future sponsor would like to drop 15 or 20k of GPU on. But yes, I have revived Homestead. So you'll have there running Mist, running Mist at Homestead, CPU mine transactions back and forth, sitting there getting the real experience of 10 year old software, original chain, original protocol. So that was fun.

**[24:10] SPEAKER_04:** Optional in the real experience or like pulling out your hair in frustration optional or required experience? Because I remember a lot of that myself.

**[24:22] SPEAKER_00:** I'm just hoping they don't crash too often.

**[24:24] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I remember Mist crashing a lot when we were playing around with it.

**[24:31] SPEAKER_00:** So yes, there will be reboot instructions on hand. There's also a big chunk which Jessica Angel, the creative director, has taken the lead on. To do with some orbs that you can put your hands on and reach consensus between each other and light up different phases. And then there is also a centerpiece which is still in motion. So I won't talk about that. The hope is that a good chunk of those 20,000 people are going to walk in and experience a bit of Ethereum history, touching on those early days and people that they may have no clue were around, and get a flavor of what that year was like and get your hands on it.

**[25:49] SPEAKER_04:** And you're speaking on the main stage about it too. Right?

**[25:51] SPEAKER_00:** I am talking about early days of Ethereum. That's on the storytelling or culture stage, called New France Stage I think. So yeah, I'll be giving a little talk there though. Likely what I'll do is play some ancient videos for people's amusement. There's really fun stuff from the very early days that a lot of people again they won't have seen. Particularly that Toronto Bitcoin Expo. That was in April 2014 and it was the second time probably that most of the people on the team had met each other. Some had met in Miami in the January and then some again met in that April. But at that point Ethereum was a company. Ethereum were the headline sponsors for that event and they had a booth and they gave away hundreds or thousands of T shirts and flyers. So it was the Ethereum company for the one and only time that you ever had that. But with a new EF being engaged again that's starting to have a presence at events again which I think is a very positive thing to see. That engagement, they're obviously never going to have an EF stand up token or what have you but having a presence at ETH Denver and FCC absolutely makes sense. So hopefully they'll have a good presence.

**[27:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, no, I mean we're looking forward to see you speak Bob. I remember you were planning the same, speaking about Ethereum early days at DevConnect, but then there were issues with the Wi-Fi or the Internet. I remember PE Connect. So many people just left the main venue because they couldn't do anything. The Internet was super bad. You can say okay it's Argentina but they should have at least decent Internet. Hopefully.

**[28:19] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it will not be a problem in Denver I can assure you. They've got good Wi-Fi and they know what they're doing. But yeah, the Wi-Fi in Argentina was dreadful.

**[28:36] SPEAKER_04:** We went to off site coffee shops for Wi-Fi. So I don't think it was a general Argentina problem. It was definitely a problem.

**[28:45] SPEAKER_00:** I think it was just a capacity problem because there were so many people there. The problem specifically at the Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress was they only got in the venue like two or three hours before the event. It was an absolute rush job. But yeah.

**[29:02] SPEAKER_01:** They did everything on the volunteers. They had so many volunteers because most of the core organization of privacy were traveling. It was at the beginning of DevConnect so most of the people were just arriving. They said okay we're going to let it be run by volunteers to set up all. So yeah, maybe there was an issue but it was great. Just unfortunately you couldn't do your talk there. But hopefully to see in Denver would be amazing.

**[29:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, that talk I will re-record with them at some point. That still hasn't happened. But Denver's fine. They've been planning it forever. So yeah, what's happening with Book of Ethereum? How's things in your world?

**[29:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, we're trying to manage the winter period of crypto. It's crazy times actually. But we're doing our best. We're managing things, focusing on building the community. Really making time to invest in community building. I think it's super important. I see these months as a big chance to improve UX, improve onboarding strategies because that's something we still miss in general crypto, Ethereum specifically. They always speak about the millions of people we're still missing out on board but then you also need to do something about it. These times are pretty good to do it. Markets are terrible at the moment. So yeah it is what it is so we need to look at other things to do now. We're really active still. It's our first time in Denver now and we will do other events this year. We'll be at FCC also this year and DEFCON probably in Mumbai. Really looking forward to that one. For the rest like we're just building the community, focusing on the onboarding and UX. We'll see when the markets pick up again but for now it's just a bit low volume. They call it the winter day so we'll see. It's my first time experiencing this so we'll see how it goes. But I feel like the sentiment all over is a bit lower. Most of the investors are a bit down low sentiment because of these times.

**[31:33] SPEAKER_00:** Um.

**[31:34] SPEAKER_01:** But I feel like the sentiment all over is a bit lower. Most of the investors are a bit down low sentiment because of these times.

**[31:47] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah do you, I mean I think we all feel that a little bit. Do we prefer though like the euphoria times have some real downsides too. It's hard to be. There's so much noise in the euphoria times. I kind of like the quiet times. Although it's been a weird cycle if you believe in that. There's not been much of an alt run up which we had in the previous cycle. So the euphoria never set in the same way. It's been more value accrual to staple assets mostly and a few breakouts but it's not like it was.

**[32:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I don't really believe in the four year cycle. I came in after the supposed perfect cycle. People can never really explain what it's based on. Even the best traders in the world cannot explain how financial markets work, what is going to be the future. They all just gas a bit on their feeling and put things out of context to try to find an explanation. Right now Ethereum has been moving over the past two years with no real clarification. Feels like there is unexpected market manipulation going on that we don't have under control. You could say after the April crash last year, people like Tom Lee brought back hype with staking announcements and treasury companies. It was a big thing in the summer. ETH did very well. With the upgrade in November, fundamentally everything looked fine for January and Q1. Tom Lee made crazy predictions on the price of Ethereum. But you see, it's not what it looks like. Just because fundamentally everything is looking fine doesn't mean the price is going to that target. It's unpredictable. I cannot predict it. Maybe you guys can. It's just hard and it just is what it is. From the perspective that we have to undergo it and see what's going on and just focus on building. Because if you're not here for the building, the movement, the culture, then you will not last. If you're purely here based on the temporary price of the assets, then you're never going to be here for many years. It's a difficult space for that. So yeah, it's just my opinion.

**[34:56] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, it's funny because my current thought is that if you look at previous winters they've been more internal focused. The thing you could point to that triggered them is something happening in the crypto sphere itself, like ICOs going bust or NFTs or meme coins. Now a lot of things in the world are happening simultaneously and crypto is just one of those things. Metal prices have changed, equity prices, currency prices. My current thing is that it is a bit different this time because crypto is becoming part of the macro infrastructure. We'll look back and think okay, this is the time crypto became part of the regular financial system.

**[36:05] SPEAKER_00:** Moving more away from speculation and more to utility.

**[36:10] SPEAKER_04:** Well, I don't know if it's more speculation or utility. You could say the stock markets are affected by a lot of speculation too. But it's moving more toward a more stable view of what they are. The use of it is becoming more stable and widespread. The number of holders is increasing. The choices people have are not moving crypto bags from one crypto to another. It's considering moving it into metals or other assets outside the crypto sphere.

**[36:58] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, it's a funny thing. Tokenization makes that easier. We saw Eric Vorhees buy a huge quantity of PAXG. It hit the Internet in a big way. On balance this is a good thing. Although it makes you a bit. It's not the old days.

**[37:19] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[37:20] SPEAKER_02:** Unfortunately ETH and Bitcoin seem to trade like high beta tech stocks. They're risk on assets still. They're not behaving like metals which are somewhat anti-correlated with the stock market. But RWAs can help achieve practical day-to-day sovereignty where you have a basket of assets that are resilient from a price change perspective. RWAs may be less purely cypherpunk. Stables in circulation have doubled year over year and floating crypto prices went down. There's no reason those things have to go together. Eventually usage goes up, you'll see crazy crypto prices go up in a commodity way. Interesting times.

**[38:37] SPEAKER_04:** Well, the other thing that's not true is that typically when we've had these other winters, total volumes have gone down. That's not necessarily true now. One way to think about it is we thought crypto was the hedge against the mainstream markets. But the actual mechanism is DeFi. People are using DeFi to hedge in all kinds of different places. Because it's global and 24/7 it allows you to do that more efficiently than the rails themselves that are the hedge.

**[39:13] SPEAKER_02:** There's a lot of leverage in the system now too.

**[39:15] SPEAKER_04:** Um.

**[39:18] SPEAKER_02:** Still people believe the big sell offs have been liquidation driven. We saw the beginning in the FTX cycle, the beginning on 10/10. Things are still shaking out. I've seen tweets today about BlockFi suspending withdrawals. So supposedly a bunch of big firms are trying to manage insolvency from leverage. There's more leverage than before. Hyper liquids created 20x effective leverage out of thin air. There's a good use for these products but it means the swings are bigger, the blow ups and so on. Interesting times all around.

**[40:09] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think DeFi is going to make a major move. The stables have doubled and that's because people take less risks. Builders are exploring ways how DeFi can generate passive income over time without taking unnecessary risk. If you look into it, it's a big opportunity. We haven't seen all the possibilities of Ethereum yet. Previous cycles we've seen speculative things and the NFTs hype. The real upcoming trend is DeFi applications that are real businesses built by individuals. You don't need a big corporation to start your own business on Ethereum. That's going to be a major one. What I see recently is that in the past it was difficult for non-software engineers to build something on Ethereum. But now with AI and agents, people who couldn't build before can now build their own DeFi applications. That's going to be something we see in the next years. Building infrastructure during this winter is going to be advantageous.

**[42:33] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I agree with that. Without the noise, there's quiet building that happens. Ethereum itself wouldn't have launched unless it was for the winter we had then. Winter forces you to focus on what's meaningful for the future. Bad prices allow you to refocus your efforts on a smaller number of super important things.

**[43:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it's good as long as you don't die.

**[43:20] SPEAKER_04:** As long as you don't get completely wrecked. Yeah, basically.

**[43:24] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, it's hard to build products but be fully dependent on the price of your assets. You need to find solutions for that. Stables, yield farming, generating fees. There are so many possibilities you can explore on-chain. During long bad times, teams need to look at other opportunities. Projects that are building will recover in time if they can adapt to this new way of moving. Those that adapt will be successful. If you stay in the old format of hype with no value or fundamentals behind it, it's going to die. But if you adapt to the future and push forward, better times are ahead. The real projects continuing to build will be the ones that make it.

**[44:54] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, take a broader view. If crypto is now part of the mainstream, you're not just comparing to other crypto projects, you're comparing to legacy banking systems built in the 70s. Where are the next booms coming from? Are people going to trust their money on those systems or move to global decentralized 24/7 systems? For us the answer is obvious, but the world is just catching up.

**[45:32] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly. Banks are starting to get into crypto now. They want to bring crypto to their platform to handle customers directly. More interest in Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana. Banks in Europe are pushing new laws to allow them to handle crypto. People going with banks will only see crypto as an investment. They won't explore its full potential. They won't have ownership of their wallet. So projects in DeFi need to focus on onboarding and UX. There's potential now to get people into DeFi so they don't choose the banks. Otherwise it's going to be a fight whether banks can onboard more people or we can onboard more people. That's important to focus on. People currently at uni or young age have the potential to make a difference. We have the infrastructure, the technology. We need to focus on onboarding and UX.

**[47:29] SPEAKER_00:** Agents are maybe our largest customer base.

**[47:33] SPEAKER_02:** That's a really good point. Legacy financial systems will figure out how to deal with agents eventually, but there's a lot of problems. Banks need a meat space person to deal with accounts. Crypto doesn't have that issue. Adding to Colin's point, Uber operated a little gray, letting people give car rides. The taxi union didn't like it. Consumers picked Uber because it was awesome. Crypto is awesome but unevenly. There are a lot of sharp edges. It's unfriendly to newbies, a lot of jargon, insider culture. We've got to be more normie friendly in our approach, how we talk about the tech. Crypto is more capable than legacy financial systems in ways we haven't imagined yet. It needs liquidity to see all of that happen. Our guiding principle is to keep it true to cypherpunk values to the maximal extent, but make it as easy as possible to onboard regular human beings.

**[49:50] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, UX isn't just how things look or how you interact with it. It's also how the system behaves. Sensible defaults where if you come into the system, you're highly unlikely to get wrecked. Other systems push you to be highly levered. When markets hit winters
