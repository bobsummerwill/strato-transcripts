**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** You are live. We are live.

**[00:05] SPEAKER_01:** Hello.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_00:** Hello and welcome everybody.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_01:** Hello.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_00:** Hello. It's the week before ETH Denver. One of the major events of the Ethereum calendar, basically like the regional event for North America. So that's coming up. So, as well as the usual Strato crew, we have Colin De Picker here. Is that how you pronounce your surname?

**[00:33] SPEAKER_02:** Colin?

**[00:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, that's correct. That's my name. Hi everyone. So, yeah, Colin is my actual name. Most people know me under the name of Shiba Tarzan, which is like the crypto name I use. But, yeah, my actual name is Colin.

**[00:46] SPEAKER_00:** So sometimes Shiba Tarzan, sometimes Crypto Tarzan.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_01:** So, the Twitter handle is Cryptotarzan. I mean, that was my name that I chose when I initially joined the space, and then when we did our ENS thing with Boo, I had to come up with an original ENS name, and then it became Shiba Tarzan. I don't know how, but I came up with it. So I think it's quite funny if you think about the meme.

**[01:13] SPEAKER_00:** Guess it sticks forever, like Victor Wong's "Vic" that we've told the story of before.

**[01:19] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, probably is going to.

**[01:22] SPEAKER_00:** Be the heritage handles story. So, ourselves, Bob Summerwill, Head of Ecosystem. Kieren James-Lubin, CEO. Victor Wong, CPO. And Michael Tan, who has got a little demo for us, which we're going to start with.

**[01:48] SPEAKER_02:** Sure.

**[01:48] SPEAKER_03:** Hey everyone. So back here with another demo of Strato. For the last week and week and a half going forward, we're going to have a trading and referral contest, which I'll be showing you an update on. Let's start with that. So right now, our top gainer is anonymously 10210d28f4, 4 percent gain. You know, not very much. So everyone's got a chance if you would like to have a late entry in. As for the referral contest, we currently have three by this user in our community, and a couple referrals here. We're also going to be talking about the vault that we've added as of last Friday. Let me show you that. So this is the current position of all positions I have on mainnet: deposit 144.96 of UH Gold, and I've currently earned 1.84. But let's do a little demo on the testnet. Make my first deposit here. This account currently has USDST and Silva and silver.

**[03:08] SPEAKER_00:** Oh no silver.

**[03:11] SPEAKER_03:** Let's put five USDST. Confirm deposit. Still pausing. Successfully deposited. Great. So if you click this link, you can see what tokens are currently in the vault. It's a market making vault that just kind of rebalances the pools, and we give everybody an opportunity to participate. And some of the APY on the mainnet is currently 102.67, which is great. You can also find recent activities of swaps by the vault here. And this is all done with our automated market making bot, which you can actually find a blog about on our website. And if you ever want to withdraw, you just hit the withdrawal, and there you have it.

**[04:02] SPEAKER_02:** Hear me?

**[04:04] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah.

**[04:04] SPEAKER_02:** Jumping on the bot quickly. So the APY is obviously phenomenally high. As the assets go up, it will probably not be as phenomenally high. It is measuring the true change in underlying asset value. So theoretically, all the trades are profitable, or it doesn't do them. But the risk is sort of inventory risk, right? Like it still has to hold ETH and so on, but it is up in absolute terms. And when you deposit to it, it's sort of one asset at a time, marked to market. So if you've got some gold tokenized, you deposit that; you've got some ETH, you deposit that, and so on. But you can't just pick and choose on the withdrawal. So you just get a sort of pro rata share of the bot's assets on withdrawal, which hopefully have increased. But just so you know, if you deposit and then you're confused when you get a basket of assets back, that's the why. But yeah, the APY is very high at the moment. We're excited about it.

**[05:11] SPEAKER_03:** Everyone take advantage now while you can.

**[05:18] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, well thank you. I guess we'll move on to Denver. Want to hang around, Mike? You coming to Denver?

**[05:26] SPEAKER_03:** Uh, yes. I'm arriving Monday night.

**[05:30] SPEAKER_00:** Excellent. So I was trying to count how many times I've been to ETH Denver, and I think 2009 was my first. So I think this is maybe my fifth or my fourth. Anyone else?

**[05:46] SPEAKER_02:** Veterans moved down, though. I went early, and then we had a few years where we just skipped it in our deep enterprise days. But I think we went and sponsored in 2017, and it still had that organic feel to it. I think it still does. It's one of the unique ones. Okay, so how are the tickets done? I know we've dealt with it at a corporate level, but it's a free event, right? Is it like a lottery?

**[06:24] SPEAKER_00:** No, it's a bit weird.

**[06:26] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[06:27] SPEAKER_00:** So you can go for free—that's a key thing. It started out very hackathon-y, so it's always been grassroots volunteers, no ticket prices for normies. But you have to join the Spork DAO for your free ticket, so you have to do this onboarding. At least now, I think you don't actually have to use a wallet—I think you used to in some prior years. There seems to be a web 2.0 onboarding kind of flow, a gas list that gets you there. But there's quite a few screens of stuff to click through. Or you can just pay.

**[07:25] SPEAKER_02:** Um.

**[07:26] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, I don't know what the numbers are going to be this year. Probably around 20,000 from what I understand—that seems to be what the case was last time. How about yourself, Victor? You've been a few times.

**[07:43] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, like Kieren, I was there early, and then I think I went again. My first kind of kickstart was last year.

**[07:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right?

**[07:56] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. Now we're going back again.

**[07:58] SPEAKER_00:** And I know it's your first time, Colin.

**[08:01] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, for me, it's going to be the first time. I started actually going last year to a youth event, so this is the first time there's an opportunity for me to go to Denver. I'm excited. I've heard a lot of different opinions—people say it's great; others say it's changed over the years and is a bit more marketing-related and less core Ethereum stuff. But I'm going to experience it for myself. I mean, 20,000 people is still the only major US event in the year, so I'm quite excited to explore it. Also, they changed the format—from what I heard, maybe Bob, you can explain what changed and if it's going to have an impact compared to previous years. But yeah, I'm quite excited for my first time.

**[08:54] SPEAKER_00:** Have you been before, Mark? Have you been before, Mike?

**[09:00] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, sorry, yeah, I was there last year with you.

**[09:03] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yes. And that was your first.

**[09:06] SPEAKER_03:** Uh, yes, that was my first.

**[09:07] SPEAKER_00:** There we go.

**[09:09] SPEAKER_04:** So.

**[09:10] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, Colin, you were at ETHCC last year. I think they're fairly comparable in size—ETHCC is the European one and ETH Denver is the North America one. Is size different?

**[09:31] SPEAKER_01:** ETHCC just had a lot of side events. The main event tickets were super pricey—I think it was like €500 for a ticket. Many developers just came to Paris and went to all the side events for free drinks and food, trying to connect and get a job. I spoke to many people at ETHCC who were trying to get a job in crypto and said the main event was too expensive. That's why there were so many side events at ETHCC. Paris isn't that big compared to a city like Denver, and there were so many side events—it was incredible.

**[10:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I think it's become the curse of the major events—they become a meeting point. People go because others will be there, not necessarily for the main event. It's just, "Are you going to be in that place on those days?"

**[10:45] SPEAKER_02:** Yes.

**[10:46] SPEAKER_00:** Great. Where are you going to be? What are you going to be doing? Sign up for 100 things and see what you get and where people are. They can be very fragmented. My understanding of the move to Paris was partly to counter that—since it's a smaller place, side events have to be closer together. When I went to DevCon in Brussels, it was very fragmented. That was a bad year they had to react to. It's been a criticism of ETH Denver as well. One thing happening this year, like at DevConnect, is a World Fair approach—lots of things under the same roof. The idea is to have enough going on at the main site so you don't have to leave.

**[12:18] SPEAKER_04:** One of the challenges ETH Denver has—and I felt this at DevConnect this year—is the event itself is in the middle of nowhere. You have to choose between downtown and the venue. It depends on who you're meeting. Sometimes it just makes more sense to stay downtown.

**[12:44] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, have a day here, a day in the middle, a day on the other side.

**[12:50] SPEAKER_04:** There's no middle. That's the problem. You just go one or the other. I almost tried a Bird scooter last year to shuttle myself—that was terrifying. I'll never do that again. I'm way too old for that.

**[13:09] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I went on a Lime scooter in Austin once—it was so dangerous.

**[13:19] SPEAKER_02:** In Austin.

**[13:20] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.

**[13:20] SPEAKER_00:** Just a rattly, crappy bit of road at the side, no helmet—this is bad. One interesting thing as part of our sponsorship at ETH Denver is they have a condition: to be a sponsor of the main event, you must promise not to have a competing event during core hours. That's quite interesting—it's like, "If you want to be in the gang, no straight competition." Because side events used to be in the evening or days before/after, but now it's straight competition on the same day. Norms have changed. Victor, you talked about that with regards to Cypher Toronto.

**[14:21] SPEAKER_04:** Oh, no, it was Cypher Toronto.

**[14:23] SPEAKER_00:** Cypher.

**[14:26] SPEAKER_04:** Yes, they got booted out and made their parallel conference later, which had giant Ripple buses ferrying people.

**[14:35] SPEAKER_00:** That was a few short years ago, but very controversial at the time—you'd dare to have competing content in the same city at the same time.

**[14:48] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, and in the days when they saw blockchain as a direct competitor to SWIFT, I think that ship has sailed. It definitely is a competitor.

**[15:12] SPEAKER_00:** Talking about the corporate thing you mentioned, Colin—there's been criticism of ETH Denver for having headline sponsors that are "Ethereum killers," like Polkadot, BNB, or Cosmos as primary sponsors. But they've always had a line—it's not like we had a token where Tron was pasted everywhere or BitBoy as a main speaker like at Blockchain Futurist in Toronto. There is a line: Ethereum and friends, with many friends becoming L2s or EVM-compatible over time. It's kind of a Big Ten vision. Sponsorship is key for keeping tickets free for normal people.

**[16:46] SPEAKER_04:** Now that Vitalik doesn't like L2s, are they out of the ten?

**[16:54] SPEAKER_02:** There we go.

**[16:58] SPEAKER_04:** Yes, exactly.

**[17:00] SPEAKER_01:** Like.

**[17:00] SPEAKER_04:** The other thing that's a little different, Colin, about ETH Denver is you have hardcore dev conferences like DevConnect and DEF CON, and then commercial conferences like Consensus or Token events. ETH Denver is kind of in the middle—they try to be the culture conference, but it's a bit of both.

**[17:24] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, DevConnect is almost fully organized by the Ethereum Foundation—they have a full DevConnect team. From what I've heard from EF folks lately, they're making more of a presence in Denver this year—there's going to be an Ethereum Foundation day and a whole section. So like you say, Victor, it's a bit in the middle this time. Token Dubai or Token Singapore are even more commercial, with less of the core principles. But ETH Denver is still the biggest US event—20,000 people—so there are still lots of chances and opportunities.

**[18:27] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, and Kieren, in the past, like the first time we went, there were a couple hundred people, and then it got huge quick.

**[18:38] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, it felt familiar—it was very Denver, down the street from dispensaries, kombucha on tap. It had a hippie Agora feel, which maybe it still does.

**[19:01] SPEAKER_00:** Sports Palace was a cool building. I wondered why it had that setup with stories and ramps—it used to be a car warehouse.

**[19:16] SPEAKER_04:** Interesting.

**[19:17] SPEAKER_00:** You had this multi-level thing with ramps, some with talks. It was only a few hundred.

**[19:30] SPEAKER_02:** I might be getting this wrong, but I remember the venue changed—it was like a rodeo, right?

**[19:39] SPEAKER_00:** No, it's the same venue but a different building on that complex.

**[19:43] SPEAKER_02:** I see.

**[19:44] SPEAKER_04:** Gotcha.

**[19:45] SPEAKER_02:** I remember catching up with John some years ago—he said the legacy had to deal with extreme demand, like renting out a stadium.

**[20:02] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it's a major undertaking. There's always been a large cultural and artsy part. The thing I've been mainly involved with is the Museum of Ethereum. When you come into the venue, you go through main ticketing to an area called Biddle Alley, New Biddle City—a Blade Runner-esque Futurescape, like Meow Wolf or Diagon Alley. There are various zones, and one large one is the Museum of Ethereum, which we're sponsoring as our Golem of DevCon 0 presentation—age and ourselves, DevCon 1 era, super OGs still going. It's a mixture of physical and digital artifacts from Ethereum's early days—bios, interviews, photos from 2014 largely by Taylor Gerring, and from the Toronto Bitcoin Expo in April 2014. The other thing I've been working on is the Ethereum Time Machine—an authentic experience of running original software. I have two 2010-era white plastic MacBooks and two chunky ThinkPads. I'm trying to get back to Frontier software—I can run it, but the second phase is mining. The goal is to run 2015-era software on contemporary hardware and CPU-mine the chain back to life. I'm in the final phases—I wanted to revive Frontier, but that's very expensive—maybe a future sponsor will drop $15–20k on GPUs. But I have revived Homestead—you'll see Mist running at Homestead, CPU-mining transactions back and forth, the real experience of 10-year-old software, original chain, original protocol.

**[24:10] SPEAKER_04:** Is pulling your hair out in frustration an optional or required experience? Because I remember a lot of that myself.

**[24:22] SPEAKER_00:** I'm just hoping they don't crash too often.

**[24:24] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I remember Mist crashing a lot when we played around with it.

**[24:31] SPEAKER_00:** So there will be reboot instructions on hand. Also, Jessica Angel, the creative director, has led a big chunk with orbs you can put your hands on to reach consensus and light up different phases. There's also a centerpiece still in motion, so I won't talk about it. The hope is that a good chunk of those 20,000 people will walk in and experience Ethereum history, touching on early days and people they may not know were around, getting a flavor of what that year was like.

**[25:49] SPEAKER_04:** And you're speaking on the main stage about it too, right?

**[25:51] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I'm talking about early days of Ethereum on the storytelling or culture stage—I think it's called New France Stage. I'll likely play some ancient videos for amusement—really fun stuff from the very early days that many haven't seen, particularly from the Toronto Bitcoin Expo in April 2014. That was probably the second time most of the team met—some in Miami in January, some in April. At that point, Ethereum was a company—they were headline sponsors, gave away hundreds or thousands of T-shirts and flyers. It was the Ethereum company for the one and only time. With the new EF being engaged again—not as a company but with a presence at events like ETH Denver and ETHCC—that's a very positive thing. They'll never have an EF token, but having a presence makes sense.

**[27:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, we're looking forward to seeing you speak, Bob. I remember you were planning something similar at DevConnect, but there were Wi-Fi issues—I hope Denver has good internet because at DevConnect, so many people left the main venue due to bad internet.

**[28:19] SPEAKER_00:** I can assure you it won't be a problem in Denver—they've been there a good chunk of time and know what they're doing. The Wi-Fi in Argentina was dreadful.

**[28:36] SPEAKER_04:** We went to off-site coffee shops for Wi-Fi—it wasn't a general Argentina problem, definitely a venue problem.

**[28:45] SPEAKER_00:** I think it was a capacity problem—so many people. Specifically at the Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress, they only got the venue two or three hours before—it was an absolute rush job.

**[29:02] SPEAKER_01:** They did everything with volunteers—most of the core DevConnect org were traveling, arriving at the beginning, so they let volunteers set it all up. Maybe there was an issue, but it was great—you just couldn't do your talk. Hopefully we'll see it in Denver.

**[29:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I'll re-record that talk with them at some point—it hasn't happened yet. It was a bit of a mess, but Denver's fine—they've been planning forever. What's happening with Book of Ethereum? How's things in your world?

**[29:57] SPEAKER_01:** We're trying to manage the winter period of crypto. It's crazy times, but we're doing our best—focusing on building the community, investing in community building. I think it's super important. These months are a big chance to improve UX and onboarding strategies—we still miss that in crypto, Ethereum specifically. They speak about millions of people we're missing, but we need to do something about it. These times are good for that—slow volume days, terrible markets, so we look at other things. We're still active, going to ETH Denver for the first time, and other events this year—ETHCC and probably DevCon in Mumbai. We're just building the community, focusing on onboarding and UX, and we'll see when markets pick up. It's my first winter experience, so we'll see how it goes.

**[31:33] SPEAKER_00:** Um.

**[31:34] SPEAKER_01:** The sentiment all over is a bit lower—investors are at least a bit down because of these times.

**[31:47] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I think we all feel that a little bit. Do we prefer the euphoria times? They have real downsides—so much noise. I kind of like the quiet times. Although this past cycle—if you believe in that—hasn't had much of an alt run-up like before. Euphoria never set in the same way; it's been value accrual to staple assets mostly, with a few breakouts, not like it was previously.

**[32:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I don't really believe in the four-year cycle. I came in after the supposedly perfect cycle, and even the best traders can't explain how financial markets work or predict the future—they just guess based on feelings and put things out of context.

**[33:06] SPEAKER_00:** Um.

**[33:07] SPEAKER_01:** Looking at Ethereum the asset over the past two years, there's no real clarification for its price movements—why it goes to a new all-time high and then crashes. It feels like unexpected market manipulation we don't control. After the April crash last year, people like Tom Lee brought back hype with staking announcements and treasury companies—it was a big thing in the summer, ETH did well. Then with the November upgrade, everything looked fundamentally perfect for January and Q1—Tom Lee made crazy price predictions. But it's not because fundamentals are fine that the price hits targets. It's unpredictable—I can't predict it. From my perspective, we have to undergo it and focus on building. If you're not here for the building, the movement, the culture, you won't last. If you're purely here for temporary asset prices, you won't be here for many years.

**[34:56] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, it's funny—my current thought is that previous winters were triggered by things in the crypto sphere itself, like ICOs busting or NFTs. Now, lots of things are happening in the world simultaneously, and crypto is just one of them—metal prices, equity prices, currency prices have all changed. I think crypto is becoming part of the macro infrastructure—we'll look back and see this as when crypto became part of the regular financial system.

**[36:05] SPEAKER_00:** So moving more away from speculation and more to utility.

**[36:10] SPEAKER_04:** Well, I don't know if it's more speculation or utility—the stock market is affected by speculation too. But people's view on what crypto is becoming more stable, and usage is becoming more widespread. People aren't just moving crypto bags between cryptos—they're considering moving into metals or other assets outside crypto.

**[36:58] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, tokenization makes that easier. We saw Eric Vorhees buy a huge quantity of PAXG, and it hit the internet big. On balance, this is good, though it's not the old days. It's unfortunate that ETH and Bitcoin trade like high-beta tech stocks—they're risk-on assets, not behaving like anti-correlated metals. The positive side is RWAs can help achieve practical day-to-day sovereignty with a resilient basket of assets. RWAs may be less purely cypherpunk, but stablecoins in circulation have doubled year-over-year while crypto prices went down. Eventually, as usage goes up, crypto prices will rise commodity-style. Interesting times.

**[38:37] SPEAKER_04:** On that note, in previous winters, total volumes went down—that's not necessarily true now. One way to think about it is we thought crypto was the hedge, but the actual mechanism is DeFi. People use DeFi to hedge globally and 24/7, more efficiently—the rails themselves are the hedge.

**[39:13] SPEAKER_02:** There's a lot of leverage in the system now too.

**[39:15] SPEAKER_04:** Um.

**[39:18] SPEAKER_02:** People believe big sell-offs have been liquidation-driven. We saw the beginning in the FTX cycle, and things are still shaking out. I've seen tweets today about BlockFi suspending withdrawals—big firms managing possible insolvency from leverage. There's more leverage than before—hyper-liquid platforms created 20x effective leverage out of thin air. There's good use for these products, but swings and blow-ups will be bigger. Interesting times all around.

**[40:09] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, what I also feel is that DeFi is going to make a major move—it has to, because stablecoins have doubled. Builders are taking less risk, exploring ways DeFi can generate passive income without unnecessary risk. If we can explore what Vitalik and Gavin Wood said from the beginning—building real businesses on Ethereum—we haven't seen all possibilities yet. Past cycles had speculation, NFT hype, but the real upcoming trend is DeFi applications as real businesses built by individuals—you don't need a big corporation anymore. What I see now is it's becoming easier for non-software engineers to build on Ethereum—the EF is bullish on agents, like the Clawbot stuff and Moldbook. Even our community has an ERC-8004 agent participating in hackathons and building things. With AI and agents, people who couldn't build before can now create their own DeFi apps—that's what we'll see in the next years. Builders are pushing this forward, focusing less on speculative assets. Building infrastructure during this winter will be to your advantage.

**[42:33] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I totally agree—without the noise, there's quiet building. Ethereum itself wouldn't have launched when it did without the winter. It forces focus on what's meaningful for the future. No one likes bad prices, but it allows refocusing on super important things.

**[43:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it's good as long as you don't die.

**[43:20] SPEAKER_04:** As long as you don't get completely wrecked.

**[43:24] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, it's hard to build products fully dependent on asset prices. You need solutions—stablecoins, yield farming, generating fees. Since the last good on-chain volume—just before Trump got elected—teams have had to look at other opportunities. Projects that adapt will recover; those that don't—just hype with no value—will die like Bob says. If you adapt and push forward, better times are ahead 100%. Real projects that keep building will make it.

**[44:54] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, and you've got to take a broader view. If crypto is now part of the mainstream, you're not just comparing to other crypto projects—you're comparing to legacy banking systems built in the 70s. The question is: will people trust their money on those systems or move to global, decentralized, 24/7 systems? For us, the answer is obvious, but the world is catching up.

**[45:32] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, it's a really important moment—banks are getting into crypto to handle customer demand, especially in Europe. New laws are being pushed to let banks handle crypto, but people will just see it as a stock investment, not explore full potential—they won't have wallet ownership, the bank will host it. That's why DeFi projects must focus on onboarding and UX—there's potential to get people into DeFi instead of banks. It's a fight: will banks onboard more people or will we? That's something to look into. For my generation—uni students, young people—they have the potential to make a difference. We have the infrastructure and technology; we just need to focus on onboarding and UX—that's most important.

**[47:29] SPEAKER_00:** And I think agents are maybe our largest customer base.

**[47:33] SPEAKER_02:** Moving forward, that's a really good point—legacy finance won't deal with agents for a while. They need meat-space people for bank accounts, which you don't in crypto. Adding to Colin's point, I look at Uber as a model—they operated a bit gray, letting people give rides, taxi unions didn't like it, but consumers picked it because it was awesome. Crypto is awesome but unevenly—sharp edges, unfriendly to newbies, lots of jargon, insidery culture. We've got to be more normie-friendly in tech and how we talk about it. It's a fight for the same deposits. Crypto is more capable than legacy finance in ways we haven't imagined, but it needs liquidity to see that happen. A big guiding principle is to keep it true to cypherpunk values but make it as easy as possible to onboard regular people.

**[49:50] SPEAKER_04:** And I think one thing—Colin, you talk about UX, which people think is just how things look. Bob coined "agentic experience"—part of it is how the system behaves. Crypto hasn't done well on sensible defaults—if you come in, you're highly unlikely to get wrecked. Other systems push you to be super leveraged, and in winters, you get destroyed and never come back. Part of the experience is safety—not just cybersecurity, but sensible defaults. Banks impose that; we should give users options at the start, then move them to riskier behaviors when they understand the system.

**[51:11] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly. What I mean with UX—looking back at my story, I joined at 16, lost all my money in the first year, like many friends from random Telegram groups. Back then, I thought it was normal, but now from a business perspective, it's not normal. People get in, don't feel safety, don't get support or right tools or onboarding guidelines. That's what I mean with UX and onboarding—companies must prioritize bringing in the right people and educating them before they explore on-chain. Otherwise, they get wrecked, lose money, speak badly about crypto—scams, drained wallets, wrong sends. All preventable with education. It's time-consuming but super important for long-term success. As Kieren said, and Vitalik in recent posts—cypherpunk culture, decentralization, self-sovereignty, self-custody, privacy are super important. We've built amazing tech, but for customers, it's not relevant if you're not a computer science guy. Keep it in the background; bring it to customers as "this is super safe, these are the advantages," explained in a normie way. If we push these methods, we'll see big progress over the next years.

**[54:08] SPEAKER_04:** Well, Colin, your story is bang on—you're super brave for losing everything and coming back. When I think of UX, one principle is: if you're a beginner, you should easily make a little profit without worrying about all these things. Only when you step on the gas do you worry. If we change the first experience to Vitalik's "low-risk default"—you do something simple and make a little bit—then you can explore and gradually ramp up. Very few people are as brave as you, Colin.

**[55:07] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, thousands of people like me experienced this—some believe it's a scam and leave for stocks or Web2. It's important to focus on those things. What Vitalik said about low-risk DeFi and his recent post on L2s—so many degens on X misinterpreted it, saying L2s are bad, failed projects, causing ETH price to drop. But normal people read it and believe it. What Vitalik meant is L2s are stuck in phase two, too competitive—"who has cheapest gas?"—like mini Ethereums. They should focus on their USP—unique selling proposition—and bring that to normies. Stop focusing on being the cheapest; the L1 is scaling—Vitalik said don't worry, L1 scalability is high. That's what he meant. L2s should focus on their USP, and low-risk DeFi is another major factor. Vitalik's been saying good things lately, but people interpret it wrong.

**[57:11] SPEAKER_00:** All righty, well, I'm looking at—

**[57:12] SPEAKER_02:** The clock, we're coming up on the—

**[57:14] SPEAKER_00:** Hour, so I think that's probably a good time to leave it. I shall see you all in Denver next week.

**[57:21] SPEAKER_04:** Yes, playing with Mist on wetland.

**[57:28] SPEAKER_02:** Everyone out there, please check us out—big things coming soon. There's the vault, but everything else as well. Also check out Colin's community. Colin, you want to leave a last note?

**[57:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, first of all, thanks for having me. Looking forward to speaking to all of you again in Denver—it's been a long time, so really looking forward to that. Let's keep the discussions going further in Denver. Thanks for having us.

**[57:59] SPEAKER_02:** Thank you. Bye.

**[58:00] SPEAKER_01:** Bye. Bye. Bye.
