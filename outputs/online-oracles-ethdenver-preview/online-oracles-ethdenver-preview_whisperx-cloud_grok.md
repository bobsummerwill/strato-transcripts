**[00:02] SPEAKER_05:** You are live we are live hello hello and welcome everybody hello hello it's the week before F Denver one of the major events of the the Ethereum calendar basically like the regional the regional event for for North America so that's coming up so so yeah as well as the usual usual Strato crew we have Colin the Picker here is that how you pronounce your surname.

**[00:33] SPEAKER_00:** Colin yeah yeah that's correct that's my name hi everyone so yeah I'm Colin is my actual name most people know me under the name of Shiba Tarzan which is like the crypto name I use but yeah.

**[00:45] SPEAKER_05:** My actual name is Colin so sometimes Shiba Tarzan sometimes Crypto Tarzan so yeah the Twitter handle.

**[00:55] SPEAKER_00:** Is Crypto Tarzan I mean that was my name that I chose when I initially joined the space and then when we did our like ENS thing with Boo then I had to come up with an original ENS name and then it became Shiba Tarzan I don't know how but I came up with it so I think it's quite funny if you think.

**[01:11] SPEAKER_05:** About like the meme I guess it sticks forever like like Victor's Victful Wong that we've told the story of before yeah yeah probably probably is going to be the heritage heritage handles story so so yeah we we we're here myself Bob Summerwill head of ecosystem Kieren James-Lubin a CEO a bit Wong Victor Wong CPO three CPO three CPO and Michael Tan who has got a little demo for us.

**[01:46] SPEAKER_01:** Which we're going to start with sure hey everyone so back here with another demo Strato this for the last week and week and a half going forward we're going to have we're currently in a trading and referral contest which I'll be showing you an update on let's start with that sec so right now our top gainer is anonymously 102 10d28f four percent gain you know not very much so everyone's got a chance if you would like to and to have a late entry in as for the referral contest we currently have three by this user in our community and yeah a couple of referrals here we're also going to be talking about the vault that we've added as of last Friday let me show you that so this is this is the current position of all position I have on mainnet deposit 144.96 of gold and I'm currently I've currently earned a dollar 84 but let's do a little demo on the testnet make my first deposit here this account currently has USDT and SOV and silver oh no silver let's put five USDT firm deposit still pausing successfully deposited great so the if you click this link you can see what tokens are currently in the vault it's a market making vault that just kind of rebalances the pools and we give everybody an opportunity to participate in some of the APY on the main net it's currently 102.67 which is great you can also find recent activity the swaps by the vault here and this is all done with our automated market making bot which you can actually find a blog about on our website and if you ever want to withdraw you just hit the withdrawal and there.

**[03:59] SPEAKER_04:** You have it you hear me yeah jumping on the on the bot quickly so the the APY obviously phenomenally high as the assets go up it will probably not be as phenomenally high it is measuring the true change in underlying asset value so theoretically all the trades are profitable or it doesn't do them but it's also the so then the risk is sort of inventory risk right like it still has to hold ETH and and so on but it is up in absolute terms and when you deposit to it it's sort of one asset at a time mark the market so if you've got some gold tokenized you deposit that you've got some ETH you deposit that and so on but you can't just pick and choose on the withdrawal so you you just get a sort of pro rata share of the the bot's assets on withdrawal which hopefully have increased but just just so you know so if you deposit and then you you're confused when you get a basket of assets back that's that's the why but yeah it's a APY is very high at the at the moment we're excited about it everyone take advantage now where you can.

**[05:19] SPEAKER_05:** Okay well thank you I guess we'll we'll we'll move on to Denver do you want to hang around Mike you look at you are you coming to Denver yes I'm arriving Monday night excellent so I was trying I was counting how many times I've been to F Denver and I think 2009 was my first so I think this is.

**[05:40] SPEAKER_04:** Maybe my third or my fourth anyone else veterans of Denver I went early and then I sort of we you know we had a few years where we just sort of skipped it in our deep in our enterprise days but I think we we went and sponsored in 2017 actually and so it was still kind of had like organic feel to it I think it still does I mean it's one of the unique ones where by the way okay so how are the tickets done I know we've dealt with it at a corporate level it's a free event.

**[06:20] SPEAKER_05:** Right but yeah is it like a lottery like how do you no no it's it's a bit weird yeah so you can go for free right that's kind of a a key thing right you know it started out very hackathon-y so it's always been a you know grassroots volunteers like no ticket prices for you know normies but but you have to join the Spork DAO for your free ticket so you have to do this onboarding at least now I think you don't actually have to use a wallet I think you used to in some prior years you had to there seems to be like a you know like a a web 2.0 onboarding kind of flow gasless that gets you there but there's quite a few screens of stuff to to click through that's for sure or you can just pay but but yes I mean I know what the numbers are gonna be this year probably around 20 000 from what I understand that seems to be what what what the case was was last time how about.

**[07:41] SPEAKER_03:** Yourself Victor you've been a few times yeah like Kieren I was there early and then I think I went to gain my first kind of kickstart is was last year right yeah now we're going back again so.

**[07:58] SPEAKER_00:** And I know it's your first time Colin yeah for me for me it's gonna be the first time I mean I started actually going last year to ETH events so this is the first time that there's like an opportunity for me to go to Denver so yeah I'm excited I heard like a lot of different opinions people say it's great other people say kind of changed over the years and it's a bit more you know more marketing related and less you know core Ethereum stuff but yeah I mean I'm gonna try to experience it for myself and see what it's all about I mean like I said 20 000 people is still I mean it's the only major U.S event I think there is in the year so yeah I'm I'm quite excited to explore it I think it's gonna be great also they like changed the the format from what I heard I mean maybe Bob you can explain a bit on like what changed there and if it's like gonna have an impact on the previous years of course but yeah I'm quite excited for my first time.

**[08:54] SPEAKER_01:** Have you been before Mike have you been before Mike oh sorry yeah I was there last year with you oh yes and that was your first yes that was my first there we go there we go so so yeah I mean.

**[09:10] SPEAKER_05:** Colin you were you were at ECC last year I mean I think yes they're fairly comparable-ish sizes I kind of kind of think of like you know ECC is the European one and ETH Denver was the North America one you know kind of kind of similar ish size yeah it's you see just that like I feel like it had like.

**[09:33] SPEAKER_00:** A lot of side events I mean because like for ECC the the main event tickets were just like I mean they were super pricey I think it was like 500 euros for tickets and just like many people or like many developers just came to get to Ken and then they just like went to all the side events to get like the free drinks free food like always and then try to connect somewhere try to get a job I mean I spoke to like many people at ECC that were actually trying to get a job into the crypto space and they said oh yeah the main event is too expensive so that's like that's why I also think there were so many side events at ECC I mean for like the location Ken is not that big I mean Bob you explored it I mean compared to like a city like Denver it's like super small and then I mean there.

**[10:17] SPEAKER_05:** Were so many side events it was just incredible yeah I mean I think it's it's it's become the curse of the major events is they they kind of become like a you know a meeting point you know they're like all right if you're there like people will be there right you know so they become like a are you going to be there and it's kind of like not so tied even to the main event it's just like are you physically going to be in that place on those days yes great where are you going to be what are you going to be doing I don't know there's all these different side events you know just sign up sign up for a hundred things and see what yeah what you get and see where people are they they can be very very fragmented I mean I mean my understanding of the the move to Can was partly to try and like counter that because at least it's like a physically smaller place so the side events have to be kind of closer together so you're not so so fragmented what I when I went to ECC the prior year in Brussels I felt that was very very fragmented like I think you know that was kind of a really bad kind of year that they had to sort of react to and it has been a criticism of in Denver as well I mean one thing I've seen that's happening in Denver this year is like happened in DevConnect if kind of like the world fair lots of things under the same roof there seems to be kind of a a push to that kind of thing right of saying well we're gonna get lots of threads under that same you know banner it's like come to the main site and stay right you know there's enough going on that you don't have to leave you've got these different threads.

**[12:16] SPEAKER_03:** Happening well I think one of the challenges that ETH Denver has and I kind of felt this at DevConnect this year what was that the event itself is in the middle of nowhere so you got to kind of make a call between like yeah and a lot of the side events are downtown so you got to kind of make a call of like do I stay downtown or do I go out there and it kind of depends on who you're meeting really you know sometimes it just makes more sense to kind of stay downtown yeah a day here a day in the middle a day on the other side there's no middle that's the problem right like there's just you just gotta go one or the other you know I almost I tried a Bird scooter for the first time last year trying to shuffle shuttle myself and I that was terrifying I'll never do that again I'm way too.

**[13:09] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah I I went on a Lime scooter thing in Austin one time and it was like this is so dangerous.

**[13:16] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah in Austin yeah wow okay that's just like a rattly crappy bit of road at the side no helmet just.

**[13:26] SPEAKER_05:** Like this is bad well one of the things I saw as part of our sponsorship which was quite interesting at F Denver is they actually have a condition in there to be a sponsor of the main event that you have to promise not to have a competing event during core hours I thought that was quite interesting it's like right hey you want to be in the gang no straight competition because I mean that's like that's the that's a real killer thing right it used to be side events were you know in the evening days before days after and now it's just no we're just like we're having our main conference on exactly the same day as you like just straight competition yeah it's funny how the norms have changed like Victor you talked about that in with regard to Ripple and and and Consensus.

**[14:21] SPEAKER_03:** Oh no it was Cybo's Toronto Cybos yeah it was yes that they that they kind of got booted out and then they made their parallel conference later though their parallel conference you know had and this.

**[14:35] SPEAKER_05:** Was a few short years ago but very amazing and controversial at the time that you would dare to you know have some competing content in the same city at the same time yeah I mean it was yes and.

**[14:50] SPEAKER_03:** Well I think the big thing was they had these like giant Ripple buses in front that like buried you so it was just like yeah like you know also in the days when they saw blockchain as direct competitor to Swift I think that that chip is zeroed like I think it definitely is a competitor.

**[15:12] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah I mean talking about sort of the the corporate thing that you were mentioning there Colin so you know there has been some criticism of F Denver specifically for having like headline sponsors that are Ethereum killers in quotes yeah so it's like you know how dare you have whatever like Polkadot as a primary sponsor or BNB you know or Cosmos or what have you but but they've they've always had this they've always had a line so it's not not like we had a token where you've got Tron everywhere and Justin Sun's face pasted all over the shop you know like that's not happening and you're not seeing like BitBoy as a main speaker has happened in in Blockchain Futurist in in in Toronto so so there is a line which I think is sort of being like you know Ethereum and friends with a number of those friends having become L2s or EVM support over time anyway so it's kind of like a big tent vision but also saying you know that that sponsorship is key for keeping the tickets free for.

**[16:45] SPEAKER_03:** Normal people which is well now now that Vitalik doesn't like L2s do do we still have that here we go yes yes exactly like well the other thing that's a little bit different colored about at Denver it's like you have like the hardcore dev conferences DevConnect Devcon and then you have like what I call the commercial conferences you know Consensus yeah Token are these ones but ETH Denver is kind of in the middle I think they try to be the culture conference but it's a little bit of.

**[17:23] SPEAKER_00:** Both so it's yeah I think also like for example like DevConnect is like almost fully organized by the Ethereum Foundation I mean they have like a full DevConnect team for it so that kind of makes sense but like from what I spoke to a few guys of the EF also lately and they say like they have been making their way more into Denver this year than they did before like there is going to be an an Ethereum Foundation day if I am right yeah there's going to be like a full day for them and they have like a whole section also this time so like you say like I think what you say Victor is a bit in the middle this time and absolutely like on other events like like Token Dubai Token Singapore that's like even more to the commercial side and I mean you won't see like the EF that much there not much of the of the core principles I think so yeah I mean I think it's a bit in the middle but I see still like a lot of chances and opportunities I mean it is still like the biggest like I said before the biggest US event 20 000 people coming there I mean there's still I mean it's it's a big audience but you don't need to lie about it's a big audience still so I think there's a lot of chances for them.

**[18:26] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah and Kieren like in in the past I think like the first time we went there were like a couple hundred people and then like next year yeah when it got huge quick yeah it felt you know familiar.

**[18:41] SPEAKER_04:** Right it was kind of and it was very Denver like you know it was like down the street from the dispensaries there's kombucha on tap you know I assume that maybe still is there but yeah it had a kind of like hippie agora feel to it which maybe it still does we're gonna we're gonna see.

**[19:00] SPEAKER_05:** The Sports Palace was a cool building so apparently I I I was wondering like why it had the setup it had which is like these sort of like stories with like ramps around between them but apparently it used to be like a car warehouse place that's what interesting but but you just had this multi-level thing with sorts of ramps going up and around it and some of them were were you know just were talks and you know there's only a few hundred I might be getting this wrong but I I.

**[19:32] SPEAKER_04:** Remember so I think the venue has changed again at some point it was like a rodeo right no it's.

**[19:39] SPEAKER_05:** The same it's the same venue but a different building on that same complex I'd say gotcha but I remember.

**[19:46] SPEAKER_04:** I was catching up with John some years ago and he was telling me just the you know the legs he had to go to to deal with the amount of people who want to come which are pretty extreme like I you know on the order of renting out a stadium which is pretty funny to me yeah it's certainly a a pretty.

**[20:04] SPEAKER_05:** Major point of kind of undertaking that but but yeah there has always been a you know a large sort of cultural and artsy kind of part to it as well so so yeah I mean the thing I mean mainly involved with that is is this Museum of Ethereum so when you come into the venue you go through the main ticketing you you there is going to be a an area which is called Biddle Alley New New Biddle City which is kind of a Blade Runner-y sort of futurescape somewhere like Meow Wolf or Harry Potter diagonally kind of kind of vibes of going through this area and there are going to be various different you know sub areas and zones in there but yes one of the one of the large ones there is is Museum of Ethereum which we are sponsoring as our Golem Golem of Devcon zero presentation age and then ourselves Devcon one era so super OGs still going and it's a mixture of physical and digital artifacts drawing largely from the early days of Ethereum you know bios and interviews and everything also some photos through 2014 largely from Taylor Gerring also some of them from the Toronto Bitcoin Expo in in April 2014 and then the other thing I've been working on for that which I I think is really really cool I've called the Ethereum Time Machine so what I'm providing there is an authentic experience of running original software so I have got two 2010 era white plastic MacBooks and two chunky ThinkPads and so I was trying to get back to Frontier software I can run Frontier software however the second phase is actually mining so the goal I had is can you run you know 2015 era software on contemporary hardware CPU mine the chain back to life so that's what I've been working on like in the background for a couple of months so basically like GPUs at first get the thing moving and then as it's moving the difficulties coming down and you're easing off so I'm in in the final phases of that I wanted to revive Frontier sadly that's a very very expensive proposition that maybe some other future sponsor would like to drop 15 or 20k of GPU on but but yes I have revived Homestead so you know what you'll have there is is is running Mist running Mist at Homestead CPU mind transactions back and forth sitting there getting you know the real experience of 10 year old software original chain original protocol so that.

**[24:06] SPEAKER_03:** Was that was that was fun so to get to that optional in the real experience or like I'm sorry is pulling out your hair and frustration optional or required because I remember a lot of that myself I'm just hoping they don't crash too often yeah I I remember Mist crashing a lot like I when we were playing around.

**[24:30] SPEAKER_05:** With it so yes there will be reboot instructions on on hand so there's there's also are you that there's there's there's there's also a big chunk which Jessica Angel the creative director had has taken the lead on to do with some orbs that you can put your hands on and reach consensus between each other and light up different phases and then there is also a a centerpiece which is still in motion so I won't talk about but but yeah you know the hope is that a good chunk of those 20 000 people are gonna are gonna walk in and they're gonna experience a bit of a bit of Ethereum the history really touching on those early days and people that they may have got no clue were around and have a little bit of a flavor of of what that year was like and get your.

**[25:47] SPEAKER_03:** Hands on and and you're speaking on the main stage about it too right so like I am talking about early.

**[25:54] SPEAKER_05:** Days of Ethereum as well yeah that's on this this there's a stage that's like storytelling or culture I can't remember quite what what that's called it's called like New France stage I think so so yeah I I'll be giving a little talk there though likely what I'll do is is play some ancient videos for people's amusement there are you know there's really fun stuff from the very early days that a lot of people again they they they won't have seen I mean particularly that Toronto Bitcoin Expo so that was that was in April 2014 and it was like the second time probably that most of the people on the team had met each other you know some some had met in Miami in the January and then some again met in that April but at that point Ethereum was it was like a company so Ethereum were the headline sponsors for that event and they had a booth and they like gave away hundreds or thousands of t-shirts and flyers and so it was you know it was the Ethereum company for the one and only time that you've ever had that though with the new EF being engaged again that's they're not being the company but they are starting to you know to have a presence at events again which which I think is a very positive thing to see you know that engagement you know they're obviously never going to have an EF stand-up token or what have you but having a presence at F Denver and ECC absolutely makes sense so hopefully they'll they'll have a good presence yeah no I mean we're looking forward to see you.

**[27:48] SPEAKER_00:** Speak Bob but I remember like I think you were kind of planning the same I mean or like also speaking about Ethereum early days at DevConnect but then there was like all issues with like the Wi-Fi or something or the internet I remember so I hope this time the like the internet is going to be good because I remember like DevConnect so many people just left the main venue again because they couldn't do anything like it was super badly the internet and you can say okay it's like Argentina but I mean come on like they should have like at least decent decent type of internets hopefully.

**[28:19] SPEAKER_05:** I mean yeah I it will not be a problem in Denver I can assure you that you know they've they've got a good they've been there a good chunk of time and they they know what they're doing but yeah.

**[28:31] SPEAKER_03:** The Wi-Fi in Argentina was was dreadful yeah I mean we we went to off-site coffee shops for Wi-Fi and you know so I don't think it was a general Argentina problem it was definitely no yeah I think it was.

**[28:46] SPEAKER_05:** Just like a capacity problem because there were so many people there and I mean the the problem at the Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress was they only got in the venue like two or three hours before the event it was an absolute like rush job but yeah I mean they did everything on like the volunteers.

**[29:04] SPEAKER_00:** I mean they had like so many volunteers because of course like the most of the core organization of Secure Privacy they were just traveling I mean it was at the beginning of DevConnect so most of the people were just arriving and they said okay we're gonna let it be run by by volunteers to set up all so yeah maybe there was like an issue but I mean it was great just like I think you just unfortunate you couldn't do your talk there but yeah hopefully to see in Denver would be amazing.

**[29:31] SPEAKER_05:** Yeah I mean that talk I will record I will re-record with them at some point that still hasn't happened but yeah I mean it was just a bit of a mess on the day but yeah Denver's fine I mean they've been planning it for perfect forever so yeah what's happening with Book of Ethereum how's.

**[29:54] SPEAKER_00:** How's things in your world yeah I mean we're trying to manage the the winter period of crypto as we speak it's I mean it's crazy times actually but we're we're doing our best we're managing things just focusing on like building the community really like making time to invest in community building I think it's like super important you know I see like these months of a big chance to like improve UX improve onboarding strategies because I feel like that's something that really like we still miss in if I speak in general crypto Ethereum specifically also I mean because like they always speak about the millions of people we're still missing out on board but then you also need to do something about it and I see like these times are are pretty good to do it I mean like there's slow volume days markets are like terrible at the moment so yeah it's it's it is what it is so we need to look at other things to do now but yeah we're like really active still and yeah it's gonna be our first time in Denver now so and we will do other events this year also I think we'll be at ECC also this year and we're going to Devcon probably also in Mumbai really looking forward to that one as well but yeah for the rest like we're just like I said building the community focusing on the onboarding and UX and I mean we will see when when the markets pick up again but yeah for now it's just a bit low volume I mean like I said they call it the winter days so yeah we'll see it's my first time experience experiencing this so yeah we'll see how it goes but yeah I feel like the sentiment all over is a bit lower I mean I feel people are kind of like I wouldn't say depressed but you know most of the investors are like at least a bit down and low sentiment because of these times so yeah do you I mean I think we all feel that a.

**[31:50] SPEAKER_04:** Little bit do we prefer though like the euphoria times have some real downsides too you know it's kind of hard to be there's so much noise in the euphoria times I kind of like the quiet times you know although it's it's been a weird this past you know cycle if you all believe in that there's not really been any much too much of an alt run-up you know which we had in the the previous one and so I think the euphoria never set in to the same way it's sort of been like still a value accrual to to staple assets mostly and a few breakouts but you know it's not like like the like it was.

**[32:33] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah no I I don't really believe also in like the four-year cycle or whatever it's called I mean I came in even after like the last supposedly perfect four-year cycle but I I mean I don't really know if you would ask those people they can never really explain on what it's based like and I mean even the best traders in the world they cannot explain how the financial markets work like what is going to be the future I mean they all just guess a bit on their feeling and you know they they put things out of context to kind of try to find an explanation for things but yeah like for example right now at like the if we if you look at Ethereum the asset just over the past two years I mean the way it's been moving there is no real like clarification for it like why it's going to a new all-time high and then again like completely down I mean it feels like there is some unexpected like market manipulation going on that like we don't have under control in some way I mean you could say like in the in in after like the April crash last year you could say okay like people like Tom Lee and others brought back some some hype with with their staking announcements and all these things and like the treasury companies and I mean it was a big thing in the summer and then you saw like it doing very well and then with the with the upgrade in the end of November that Ethereum did was massively and you would think like everything looked perfectly fundamentally for like January and like Q1 in common I mean even like Tom Lee did some crazy predictions on the price of Ethereum but yeah like you see it's not it's not what it looks like I mean it's not because fundamentally everything is looking fine that for that reason also like the price is going to that target so yeah in my opinion it's just unpredictable I mean I cannot predict it maybe you guys can I cannot predict it it's it's kind of hard and it's just it just is what it is I mean in my opinion I'm just from the perspective that we have to undergo it and see what's going on and just focus on on the building because like I said I've said this also many times to our community like if you're not here for like the building the the movement the culture then you will not last if you're just purely here based on like the temporary price of the assets then then you're never gonna be here for for many years I think so it's also quite like a different a difficult space for.

**[34:53] SPEAKER_03:** That so yeah it's just my opinion yeah it's it's it's funny because I I my current thought about what's going on is that if you if you look at previous winters and you know I know we've been through quite a few years but like they've been sort of more internal focused like the thing you could point to that kind of triggered them is like something happening in the crypto sphere itself like ICOs going bust or NFTs or meme coins or whatever and now you know it's really a lot of things in the world are happening simultaneously and crypto is just one of those things right like metal prices have changed equity prices have changed currency prices have changed and so I I I my current thing is that it is a little bit different this time because I think what's happening is crypto is becoming part of the macro infrastructure and I think we'll look back and kind of think okay this is the time that crypto did just become part of the regular financial system I think.

**[36:05] SPEAKER_05:** Sorry so moving more away from speculation and more to utility.

**[36:09] SPEAKER_03:** Well I mean there I don't know if it's more speculation or utility like you could call the stock markets affected by a lot of speculation too but I think it's moving more toward a more stable view of like people's view on what they are and the use of it is kind of becoming more stable and and widespread like the number of holders are you know like I think the choices that people have are not like oh do I move my crypto bags from one crypto to another it's like you know it's clear that people are kind of considering like okay should I move it into metal it's like we saw that happening or should I move it into you know other assets that are completely outside the crypto sphere yeah it's.

**[36:59] SPEAKER_04:** A funny thing and tokenization makes that a lot easier we saw the what Eric Voorhees buy some huge quantity of PAXG and then to hit the internet in a big way and I think on balance this is a good thing although yeah it makes you a little bit yeah it's it's it's not the old days right and I've said before you know it's it's unfortunate right that ETH Bitcoin etc seem to trade like a high beta tech stock it's a they're risk on assets still and they're not behaving like metals which you know are somewhat anti-correlated let's say with what the stock market does but you know I think so so you know the the positive side is RWAs can help achieve a certain type of like practical day to day sovereignty where you have a basket of assets that are both resilient from a price change perspective in addition you know the RWAs may be a little bit less purely cypherpunk but again we've seen strange thing also like so stables in circulation have like doubled year over year a little bit more and floating crypto prices went down you know and I suppose there's no in principle reason those things have to go together I mean eventually usage goes up you'll see crypto prices go up and then kind of a commodity way but yeah you know interesting times well I I think on that.

**[38:38] SPEAKER_03:** Note like the other thing that's not you know typically when we've had these other winters total volumes have gone down and that's not necessarily true now so I you know one way to kind of think about it that I've been thinking of is that we thought crypto was the hedge against the mainstream markets but I think the actual mechanism is DeFi like people are using DeFi to hedge in all kinds of different places and because it's global and 24 7 it allows you to do that way more efficiently than you know like it's the rails themselves that are the hedge there's a lot of.

**[39:13] SPEAKER_04:** Leverage in the system now too like the still people believe that the the big sell-offs have been liquidation driven so we saw the beginning kind of like in the FTX cycle we saw the beginning on 10 10 and things are still shaking out I've seen tweets today about Blockfills suspending withdrawals so supposedly a bunch of big firms are just trying to manage maybe effective insolvency from leverage and you know it's just it's more leverage than before the Hyperliquids and the like kind of created 20x effective leverage out of thin air I believe and you know there's good good use for these products and so it just means the swings are going to be bigger the the blow-ups and and so on so yeah interesting interesting times all around yeah like what I also feel a bit.

**[40:11] SPEAKER_00:** Is that like what Victor has been saying like I think DeFi is gonna be I'm making a major move I mean it has to be also because like I said the stables have doubled and I think that's also because people take less risks and especially like the builders they're taking less risk they're like exploring ways like how can DeFi like generate a passive income over time without like needing to take unnecessary risk and I think if you look into it it's like I mean it's a big I mean like I said I think if they can explore it more and we can actually do what like people like Vitalik and and Gavin would have been saying from the very beginning on like that's like what are you gonna build on Ethereum and all the places to build like applications I mean we haven't seen I think all the possibilities of Ethereum yet like I said the past cycles we have seen a lot of speculative things and we have the NFTs hype and everything but like the the the real like upcoming trend of DeFi applications that are real businesses built by individuals also you don't need a big corporation anymore to start your own business on Ethereum and I think that's gonna be a major one also what I see recently is that like for like in the past it was very difficult for people that were no like software engineers to build something on Ethereum but what you see now is and the EF is also quite bullish on all these things that are the agents especially with like the claw bot stuff that's going around now the mold book I mean even we as a community we have done our own ERC-8004 agent with like now participating in hackathons for us with like building things for us I mean we're exploring with it as well it is the future and I think a part of like bringing people in decentralized you know the self-custody story and all these things I think the opportunity for people that will never be able to build something or to create something to now with like the invention of AI and agents to build their own DeFi applications I think that's going to be something we're going to see in the next years I feel like and it's also something I feel like the builders are more pushing forward to I mean it's kind of the subjects and topics everywhere right now and less like the highly speculative or volatile assets you know so I think building building infrastructure during this winter is going to be in your advantage yeah yeah and I totally agree with that because it's like.

**[42:38] SPEAKER_03:** You know without the noise I I I said in the article I didn't know if this was just because I'm Canadian and I have a fondness for winter generally but there is a quiet building that happens and you know Ethereum itself would have never launched at the time it did unless it was for the winter we had it there like it also forces you to kind of focus on what is really meaningful for the future so I think that's the you know that's one like no one likes the pain of bad prices but it does allow you to kind of refocus your efforts on things that are on a smaller number of super.

**[43:14] SPEAKER_05:** Important things yeah I think it's good as long as you don't die as long as you don't get completely.

**[43:22] SPEAKER_00:** Wrecked yeah basically yeah I mean that's what I mean it's it's kind of hard to like build products but like fully be dependent on the price of your assets you need to like find solutions for that like I said like with with stable coins like building up yields farming yields all these things like generating your fees and everything like there's so many possibilities you can explore on I mean it's also because of the the long bad times especially I mean on on chain if you look on chain there has never been a good moment since I think the just before Trump got elected I think it was the last time we saw like some big on chain volume so since then all those teams bro they have they need to look at other opportunities so yeah that was what I've been saying seeing lately but I think that like the actual the projects that are building the assets of them will they will recover in due time if they can like adapt to this new way of moving and those that will adapt I think those will be the ones that are going to be successful and if you cannot adapt and if you just stay in like the old format of like oh we're just gonna do some hype and you know just purely based of like no value no fundamentals behind it then I think it's just gonna die like Bob says but if you actually like really can adapt to the future and use all of these things and push forward I think better times are ahead 100 but you just gotta continue and I think the real projects that are non-stop continuing to build I think those will be the ones that will make it eventually.

**[44:54] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah and I think also you gotta take a broader view like if my thesis of that crypto is now part of the mainstream is correct then you're not just comparing to other crypto projects you're comparing to legacy banking systems that were basically built in the 70s and haven't been updated so like if you think like now the question is like where are the next booms coming from it's that are people going to trust their money on those systems or are they going to move to global decentralized 24 7 systems you know and I think for all of us the answer is obvious but I think the world is just starting to catch up to it.

**[45:30] SPEAKER_00:** Like in in abroad yeah exactly I think it's like a really important moment now because a lot of the banks are starting to you know really get into crypto now they start they want to bring crypto to their platform so they can handle their customers directly because there's coming more and more interest people want to buy Ethereum people want to buy Bitcoin people want to buy Solana or whatever and the banks need to provide for it especially in Europe I'm seeing this right now like they are trying to push forward with like new laws to be voted so that the banks are allowed to like handle crypto and stuff but I see already like kind of issues with it and it will be like purely people that will own the asset and they will see purely as an investment and unfortunate what I'm seeing is that people if they go with the bank way they will never be able to like explore their full potential like they won't even be able to have their own ownership of the wallet the bank will host it again like they always do they're just gonna see it as a new way of like stock investment type of thing and they're not really like knowing what's going on so that's why I think as a project now in the on chain space and in DeFi you really have to focus on onboarding and UX because there is a lot of potential now to get people on on I mean I wouldn't say your side but like to get them into DeFi so they don't choose the banks because otherwise we're going to get into like a big trouble where it's going to be a fight whether like the banks can onboard more people or whether we can onboard more people so I think that's something to look into and especially it's what I'm trying to do for my generation I mean all the people that are currently at like at uni studying or just like young age they have like the potential to make the difference so yeah I think that's really important because otherwise all these things we're doing like the building is just not gonna matter I feel like so we have a big chance we have all the infrastructure we have the technology we just have to focus on onboarding and UX that's I think the most important and I think agents are maybe our.

**[47:31] SPEAKER_05:** Largest customer base moving forward feels like yeah that's a really good because everybody's just.

**[47:39] SPEAKER_04:** A while before legacy financial can deal with agents they'll figure it out eventually but it's like there's a lot of problems you need you know a meat space person to deal with when you've got a bank account that you just you know don't have to in the crypto world I I'm just adding on to Colin's point one thing I like to say is I look at like an Uber as a model in the sense that you know they're operating you know a little gray right like they they kind of you know they're going and letting people give car rides and they're the taxi union doesn't like it and and so on and consumers picked it right and you know at least Uber mostly won in the United States you know they they get taxed and so on in Europe sometimes it's just going to the the it's just routing for the the local taxis and so on but it's a model people picked it because it was awesome right crypto is awesome but it's awesome like unevenly you know it's there's just a lot of sharp edges that you you don't know how to deal with as a as a newbie it's a little bit unfriendly to people who are not super expert a lot of jargon a lot of you know it's it kind of feels like an insidery culture right and so we've got to be more you know more more kind of normie friendly I would say in the approach yeah you know the tech how you talk about the tech and so on and it's it to Colin's point it is absolutely a fight for the same you know deposits if you will right yeah and crypto is more capable than what the legacy financial world has in in ways we also just haven't even imagined yet but yeah it just needs enough liquidity and and whatnot to see all that happen so you know I think so it's by the way big guiding principle for the things we build is is to try to make keep it true to cypherpunk values to the maximal possible extent but make it as easy as possible to onboard the regular human being well and.

**[49:51] SPEAKER_03:** And I think one thing you know and Colin you're talking about UX which I think people think of as just like how things look or how you interact with it and you know Bob we were you kind of coined that term that I like like agentic experience I think part of it is how should the system behave in a variety of ways and I think one aspect that crypto hasn't done well and we are really kind of focused on is how do you create sensible defaults where if you're coming to the system you're highly unlikely to get wrecked like like other systems tend to push you to be super highly levered and you know when markets hit these winters you know you you just get destroyed and you you never want to come back right and so like it is I think part of the overall experience it's like what are what does safety look like and I don't think it's about cyber security as much as it is about you know like like I said sensible defaults that you should keep in order and you know banks impose that on you so there should be some user choice here but you know you gotta give users options at least at the starting point and then move them toward more leverage or riskier behaviors when they understand the system which is kind of.

**[51:09] SPEAKER_00:** Hard to do right now yeah yeah I mean exactly yeah sorry go on but I mean I just I just want to add that like that the thing is I feel like what I mean with UX is also I mean I look back at my own story I mean I joined when I was 16 was quite young but when I joined in the first year like all the money that I brought into crypto I lost it all like that was my first year of like experiencing crypto and what many of my friends also experienced of people where I came in touch with first mostly on like these random Telegram groups and and this is how I entered the crypto space basically and but then back then I was so young and I was just thinking it's all normal and this is like the way you need to get yourself into it but now I'm looking at like a more business perspective and seeing like hey this is like absolutely not normal I mean we're like we're more like people that getting in are just getting out again because they don't feel the safety that they should feel they don't feel they don't get the support they should get they don't get the right things to use like the right tools the right onboarding guidelines and everything and I think that's what I mean with UX with onboarding all the companies building something on crypto should really make a priority of it that they can bring the right people in and that they can educate them first before even letting them just explore the onchain world because otherwise like like Victor said you're gonna get wrecked you're gonna lose money people will just go out and like they will speak bad about the space I mean everyone will be speaking bad about crypto it's all just because they got wrecked on whether it's a random coin they got scammed because they pushed they clicked the wrong links or their wallet got drained or they send the money to the wrong wallets like all these type of cases it could be so easily prevented just if we like kind of educate everyone that is coming into it and I know it's like time consuming maybe and it's like it takes time to do this but it's super important if you want to be like successful in the long term I mean and that's just something that I really feel from my from my own experience that we should focus on more and like like Kieren said and this is the last thing I want to add to is like yes and this is also what Vitalik has been saying in his recent posts like yes like the cypherpunk culture is super important decentralization self-sovereignty like self-custody all super important privacy and all these things and we have been building the tech we have been doing absolutely amazing on the builder side but please like keep it to that and for the for the customers for the public it's not relevant if you're not a like computer science guy or like someone we built it's not relevant for you to read these things or to first start with I mean because then you're going to be completely lost and you wouldn't understand keep this on the background but bring it over to your customers as like hey this is super safe to use these are all the advantages but like explain it to them like Kieren says in a normie way that they all can understand and I think if we can really push forward these type of methods then we're going to see a big progress yeah over the next years.

**[54:07] SPEAKER_03:** That's just well and Colin your your story is bang on like I mean you're super brave for losing everything and then coming back and re-committing but I I think I think you know when I think of UX the moment that we are one of our principles is if you're a beginner you should be able to get in and make a little bit of profit very very easily without having to worry about all these things right and it's only like when you step full on the gas then you have to worry but it if we can change that simple experience from like your first experience with crypto where it's like you know Vitalik talks about low risk DeFi right like if that can be like the first thing where oh I just made a little bit like I've done something simple hardly anything and I've made a little bit then you can kind of explore and that then we can have that gradual on ramp to kind of get to the next people because I I think very few people are as brave as you Colin frankly.

**[55:05] SPEAKER_00:** We're coming back yeah no I mean I I just feel like I mean there are thousands of people like me who experienced this like thousands ten thousands hundred thousand people and unfortunately some of them really like start to believe this is all just a scam and all these things and they just completely leave they go to stocks or whatever and then they just do some normal stuff like in the web two space but yeah and and like which is like what you said it's really important to focus on those things and what Vitalik has been saying about like low risk DeFi but also about like his recent post of the layer twos which like so I saw so many degens on X were like misinterpreting what he said and were saying like oh L2s are bad we should like close down it's a failed project yeah this is why Ethereum price is going down all this type of nonsense but most of the normal people read this actually and they believe it but like to put in perspective like basically what Vitalik meant I think is that like the L2s are getting a bit stuck you know in going to their second phase and they're a bit just too competitive to each other like oh who is the cheapest gas who is this who is that like the mini Ethereums but what they should actually do is and Vitalik kind of uses a marketing principle here he says like you need to focus on like your USP you know like what is your unique selling proposition and that's really important for the for the layer twos they should focus each and then on their own USP and bring that to the customers bring that to the normies and stop with like focusing on oh with we are going to be the cheapest one we are going to be the highly competitive one because it's not necessary because the L1 is is is keeping on scaling Vitalik also said like don't worry like with the L1 we're we're keeping the scalability high look what we did in the past just focus on this and that's actually what he meant with a long post like to to keep it in like normal language and but I think that's what the layer twos for example should focus on and what you said also with low risk DeFi that's also another major factor but all these things make sense and I think Vitalik has been saying quite some good things lately but it's just people.

**[57:07] SPEAKER_05:** Interpret it the wrong way like they usually do all righty well I'm I'm looking at the clock we're coming up on the hour so I think that's probably a good time to to leave it so I shall see you all.

**[57:19] SPEAKER_03:** In Denver next week yes at playing with Mist on what if you're laughing.

**[57:28] SPEAKER_04:** Everyone out there please again check check us out bridge in big things coming soon there's the vault but everything else as well and also check out Colin's community Colin you want to leave a.

**[57:41] SPEAKER_00:** Last note yeah I mean first of all thanks for having me and yeah looking forward to speak to all of you guys again in in in Denver I mean it's been a long time since I see you guys so yeah really looking forward to that and yeah let's keep the discussions going further on in Denver so thanks for having us thank you thank you bye-bye bye-bye.
