**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** You are live. We are live.

**[00:05] SPEAKER_01:** Hello.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_00:** Hello and welcome everybody.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_01:** Hello.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_00:** It's the week before ETH Denver. One of the major events of the Ethereum calendar, basically like the regional event for North America. So that's coming up. As well as the usual Strato crew, we have Colin De Picker here. Is that how you pronounce your surname?

**[00:33] SPEAKER_02:** Colin?

**[00:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, that's correct. That's my name. Hi everyone. So, yeah, Colin is my actual name. Most people know me under the name of Shiva Tarzan which is like the crypto name I use. But yeah, my actual name is Colin.

**[00:46] SPEAKER_00:** So sometimes Shiba Tarzan, sometimes Crypto Tarzan.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_01:** So is this. The Twitter handle is Cryptotarzan. I mean that was my name that I chose when I initially joined the space and then when we did our like ENS thing with Boo, then I had to came up with an original ENS name and then it became Shiba Tarzan. I don't know how but I came up with it. So I think it's quite funny if you think about like the meme.

**[01:13] SPEAKER_00:** Guess it sticks forever like Victor's vic for Wong that we've told the story of before.

**[01:19] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, probably, probably is going to.

**[01:22] SPEAKER_00:** Be the heritage. Heritage story. So, we, we, we're here. Myself, Bob Summerwill, Head of Ecosystem. Kieren James-Lubin, CEO Victor Wong. CPO3 CPO3 CPO. And Michael Tan who has got a little demo for us which we're going to start with.

**[01:48] SPEAKER_02:** Sure.

**[01:48] SPEAKER_03:** Hey everyone. So back here with another demo of Strato. This for the last week and week and a half going forward we're gonna have. We're currently in a trading and referral contest which I'll be showing you an update on. Let's start with that sec. So right now our Top gainer is anonymously. 10210 d 28 f 4 uh percent gain. You know, not very much. So everyone's got a chance if you would like to have a late entry in. As for the referral contest, we currently have 3 by this user in our community. And yeah a couple referrals here. We're also going to be talking about the vault that we've added as of last Friday. Let me show you that. So this is, this is the current position of all position I have on mainnet deposit 144.96 of Gold. And I'm current. I've currently earned 1.84. But let's do a little demo on the testnet. Make my first deposit here. This account currently has USDST and Silva and silver.

**[03:08] SPEAKER_00:** Oh no silver.

**[03:11] SPEAKER_03:** Let's put five USDST Confirm deposit. Still pausing. Successfully deposited. Great. So if you click this link you can see what tokens are currently in the vault. It's a market making vault that just kind of rebalances the pools and we give everybody an opportunity to participate. And some of the APY on the mainnet is currently 102.67 which is great. Can also find recent activities of swaps by the vault here. And this is all done with our automated market making bot which you can actually find a blog about on our website. And if you ever want to withdraw you just hit the withdrawal and there you have it.

**[04:02] SPEAKER_02:** Hear me?

**[04:04] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah.

**[04:04] SPEAKER_02:** Jumping on the, on the bot quickly. So the, the APY obviously phenomenally high. As the assets go up it will probably not be as phenomenally high. It is measuring the true change in underlying asset value. So theoretically all the trades are profitable. Or it doesn't do them. But it's also the. So then the risk is sort of inventory risk right. Like it still has to hold ETH and so on but, but it is up in absolute terms. And when you deposit to it it's sort of one asset at a time mark the market. So if you got some gold tokenize, you deposit that, you've got some ETH, you deposit that and so on. But you can't just pick and choose on the withdrawal. So you, you just get a sort of pro rata share of the, the bots assets on withdrawal which hopefully have increased. But just, just so you know. So if you deposit and then you, you're confused when you get a basket of assets back. That's, that's the why. But yeah it's APY is very high at the. At the moment. We're excited about it.

**[05:11] SPEAKER_03:** Everyone take advantage now where you can.

**[05:18] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, well thank you. I guess we'll, we'll, we'll move on to danba. Want to hang around Mike? You, you, you coming to Denver?

**[05:26] SPEAKER_03:** Uh yes. I'm arriving Monday night.

**[05:30] SPEAKER_00:** Excellent. So I was try, I was counting how many times I've been to ETH Denver and I think 2009 was my first. So I think this is maybe my fifth or my fourth. Anyone else?

**[05:46] SPEAKER_02:** Veterans moved down though I went early and then I sort of. We, you know we had a few years where we just Sort of skipped it in our deep in our enterprise days. But I think we, we went and sponsored in 2017 actually and it still kind of had like a organic feel to it. I mean it's one of the unique ones where by the way. Okay, so how are the tickets done? I know we've dealt with it at a corporate level but it's a free event. Right? But yeah. Is it like a lottery? Like how do you.

**[06:24] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, it's, it's a bit weird.

**[06:26] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[06:27] SPEAKER_00:** So you can go for free right? That's kind of a, a key thing. Right. You know it started out very hackathony. So it's always been a, you know, grassroots volunteers like, like no ticket prices for, you know, normies. But, but you have to join the Spork DAO for your free ticket so you have to do this onboarding. At least now I think you don't actually have to use a wallet. I think you used to in some prior years. You had to. There seems to be like a, you know like a, a web 2.0 onboarding kind of flow gas list that gets you there. But there's quite a few screens of stuff to, to click through that's for sure. Or you can just pay.

**[07:25] SPEAKER_02:** Um.

**[07:26] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, so I mean I don't know what the numbers are going to be this year. Probably around 20000 from what I understand. That seems to be what, what, what the case was last time.

**[07:43] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, um, like Kieren, I was there early and then um, I think I went again. My first kind of kickstart is the words last year.

**[07:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right?

**[07:56] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. Now we're going back again so.

**[07:58] SPEAKER_00:** And I know it's your first time, Colin.

**[08:01] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, for me, for me it's going to be the first time. I mean I started actually going last year to a youth event so I mean this is the first time that there is like an opportunity for me to go to Denver. So yeah, I'm excited. I heard like a lot of different opinions. People say it's great. Other people say kind of changed over the years and it's a bit more, you know, more marketing related and less you know, core Ethereum stuff. But yeah, I mean I'm gonna try to experience it for myself and see what it's all about. I mean like I said 20,000 people is still. I mean it's the only major US event I think there is in the year, so yeah, I'm quite excited to explore it. I think it's going to be great. Also they changed the format from what I heard. I mean, maybe Bob, you can explain a bit on what changed there. And if it's going to have an impact on, the previous years, of course. But yeah, I'm quite excited for my first time.

**[08:54] SPEAKER_00:** Have you been before Mark? Have you been before Mike?

**[09:00] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, sorry, yeah, I was there last year with you.

**[09:03] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yes. And that was your first.

**[09:06] SPEAKER_03:** Uh, yes, that was my first.

**[09:07] SPEAKER_00:** There we go. There we go.

**[09:09] SPEAKER_04:** So.

**[09:10] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, I mean, Colin, you were, you were at ECC last year. I mean, I think, yes, they're fairly comparable ish sizes. I kind of kind of think of like, you know, ECC is the European one and ETH, uh, Denver's, uh, the North America one. You know, kind of, kind of similar. Is size different?

**[09:31] SPEAKER_01:** ECC just had like, I feel like it had like a lot of side events. I mean, because like for ECC, the main event tickets were just like. I mean they were super pricey. I think it was like €500 for a ticket. And just like many people or like many developers just came to, to Ken and then they just like went to all the site events to get like the free drinks, the free food like always, and then try to connect somewhere, try to get a job. I mean, I spoke to like many people at ECC. That were actually trying to get a job into the crypto space and they said, oh yeah, the main event is too expensive. So that's like, that's why I also think there were so many site events at ECC. I mean, for like the location, Ken is not that big. I mean, Bob, you explored it. I mean, compared to like a city like Denver, it's like super small. And, and then I mean there were so many site events was just incredible.

**[10:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean, I think it's, it's, it's become the curse of the major events. Is they, they kind of become like a meeting point. You know, they, they kind of become like a, you know, a, ah, you know, are you going to be there? And it's kind of like not so tied even to the main event. It's just like, are you physically going to be in that place on those days?

**[10:45] SPEAKER_02:** Yes.

**[10:46] SPEAKER_00:** Great. Where are you going to be? What are you going to be doing? I don't know. There's all these different side events. You Know, just sign up, sign up for 100 things and see what.

**[10:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[10:57] SPEAKER_00:** What you get and see where people are. They can be very, very fragmented. I mean, um, I mean my understanding of the move to Cannes was partly to try and like counter that because at least it's like a physically smaller place. So the side events have to be kind of closer together so you're not so, so fragmented. Um, when I, When I went to ECC the prior year in Brussels, I felt that was very, very fragmented. Like, I think, you know, that was kind of a really bad kind of year that they had to sort of react to. Um, and it has been a criticism of ETH Denver as well. I mean, one thing I've seen that's happening in Denver this year, um, is like happened in DevConnect. If kind of like the World Fair, lots of things under the same roof. There seems to be kind of a push to that kind of thing. Right. Of saying, well, we're going to get lots of threads under that same banner. It's like, come to the main site and stay right. There's enough going on that you don't have to leave. You've got these different threads happening.

**[12:18] SPEAKER_04:** Um, Well, I think one of the challenges that you've. Denver has, and I kind of felt this at DevConnect this year. What was that? The event itself is in the middle of nowhere. So you gotta kind of make a call between like. And a lot of the side events are downtown. So you gotta kind of make a call of like, do I say downtown or do I go out there? And it kind of depends on who you're meeting really. You know, sometimes it just makes more sense to kind of stay downtown.

**[12:44] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Have a day here. Uh, a day in the middle, a day on the other side.

**[12:50] SPEAKER_04:** There's no middle. That's the problem. Right. Like there's just. You just gotta go one or the other. You know, I almost, uh, I tried a bird scooter for the first time last year trying to shuffle shuttle myself and I. That was terrifying. I'll never do that again. I'm way too old for that.

**[13:09] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I, I went on a lime scooter thing in Austin one time and it was like, this is so dangerous.

**[13:19] SPEAKER_02:** In Austin.

**[13:20] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.

**[13:20] SPEAKER_00:** Wow. Okay. That's just like a rattly crappy bit of road at the side. No helmet. Just like, this is bad. One of the things I saw as. As part of our sponsorship, which was quite interesting at ETH Denver, uh, is they actually have a condition in there to be a sponsor of the main event. That you have to promise not to have a competing event during core hours. I thought that was quite interesting. It's like. Right, yeah, uh, you want to be in the gang. No. Straight competition. Because, I mean, that's like, that's the. That's a real killer thing. Right. It used to be side events were, you know, in the evening, days before, days after, and now it's just. No, we're just like. We're having our main conference on exactly the same day as you. Like, just straight competition. Um, yeah, it's funny how the norms have changed. Like, Victor, you talked about that, uh, in. With regards to Ripple and. And, uh, Consensus.

**[14:21] SPEAKER_04:** Oh, no, it was ETH Bos Toronto.

**[14:23] SPEAKER_00:** ETH Bos.

**[14:26] SPEAKER_04:** It was, yes, that they, uh, that they kind of got booted out. And then they made their parallel conference later though. Their parallel conference, you know, had.

**[14:35] SPEAKER_00:** And this was a few short years ago, but very amazing and controversial at the time that you would dare to, uh, you know, have some competing content. Same city at the same time.

**[14:48] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I mean, it was. Ah, yes. And, well, I think the big thing was they had these like, giant Ripple buses in front that like, ferried you to. So it was just like. Yeah, like, you know, um, also in the days when, uh, they saw Blockchain as direct competitor to Swift, I think that that ship is zeroed. Like, I think it definitely is a competitor.

**[15:12] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I mean, um, talking about sort of the. The corporate thing that you were mentioning there, Colin, so, you know, there has been some criticism of ETH Denver specifically for having, like, headline sponsors that are, uh, Ethereum killers in quotes. Uh, yeah, so it's like, you know, how dare you have whatever, like Polkadot as a primary sponsor or. Or BNB, um, uh, you know, or Cosmos or what have you. But. But they've. They've always had a line. So it's not. Not like we had a token where you've got Tron everywhere pasted all over the shop. You know, like, that's not happening. And you're not seeing like, Bitboy as a main speaker has happened in, uh, in Blockchain Futurist in, uh, in Toronto. So. So there is a line which I think is sort of been like, you know, Ethereum and friends with a number of those friends having become L2s or EVM support over time. Anyway, so it's kind of like a big Ten vision. Um, but also saying, you know, that sponsorship is key for keeping the tickets free for normal people, which is.

**[16:46] SPEAKER_04:** Well, now that Vitalik doesn't like O2s. Do. Do we still have that? Are they out of the 10?

**[16:54] SPEAKER_02:** There we go.

**[16:58] SPEAKER_04:** Yes, exactly.

**[17:00] SPEAKER_01:** Like.

**[17:00] SPEAKER_04:** Well, the other thing that's a little bit different, Colin, about ETH Denver, it's like you have like the hardcore dev conferences, DevConnect, ETH Con.

**[17:10] SPEAKER_01:** Mhm.

**[17:10] SPEAKER_04:** And then you have like what I call the commercial conferences, you know, Consensus. Yeah, Token or these ones. But ETH Denver is kind of in the middle. I think they try to be the culture conference, but it's a little bit of both. So it's.

**[17:24] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think also like, for example, like, DevConnect is like almost fully organized by the Ethereum Foundation. I mean, they have like a full DevConnect team for it. Um, so that kind of makes sense. But like, from what I spoke to a few guys of the EF lately and they say like, they have been making their way more into ETH Denver this year than they did before. Like, there is going to be an, um, an Ethereum Foundation day, if I am right. Yeah, there's going to be like a full day for them. Um, and they have like a whole section also this time. So like you say, like, I think what you say, Victor, is a bit in the middle this time. Um, and absolutely. Like on other events, like, like Token Dubai, Token Singapore, that's like even more to the commercial side. And I mean you won't see like that much. There's, um, not much of the, of the core principles. I think so. Yeah. I mean, I think it's a bit in the middle, but I see still like a lot of chances and opportunities. I mean, it is still like the biggest, like I said before, the biggest US event. 20, 000 people coming there. I mean there's still, I mean it's, it's a big audience, but you don't need to lie about it. It's a big audience still. So I think there's a lot of chances for them.

**[18:27] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. And Kieren, like, in, in the past, I think, like the first time we went there were like a couple hundred people. And then like next year it got huge quick.

**[18:38] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, it felt, you know, familiar. Right. It was kind of. And it was very Denver. Like, you know, it was like down the street from the dispensaries. There's Kombucha on top. You know, I assume that maybe still is there, but, um, yeah, it had a kind of like hippie, uh, Agora, uh, feel to it, which maybe it still does. We're gonna, we're gonna see.

**[19:01] SPEAKER_00:** Sports palace was a cool building. Um, so apparently I was wondering like why it had the setup it had which is like these sorts of like stories with like ramps around between them. But apparently it used to be like a car warehouse place. That's why.

**[19:16] SPEAKER_04:** Interesting.

**[19:17] SPEAKER_00:** But, but you just had this multi level thing with sort of ramps going up and round it and some of them were, were, you know just were, were talks and stuff. But yeah, it was only a few hundred.

**[19:30] SPEAKER_02:** I might be getting this wrong but I, I remember um. So I think the venue has changed again at some point. It was um, like a rodeo, right?

**[19:39] SPEAKER_00:** No, it's the same. It's the same venue but a different building on that same complex.

**[19:43] SPEAKER_02:** I see.

**[19:44] SPEAKER_04:** Gotcha.

**[19:45] SPEAKER_02:** But I remember I was catching up with John some years ago and he was telling me just the you know, the legacy had to go to, to deal with the amount of people who wanted to come uh, which are pretty extreme. Like you know on the order of renting out a stadium. Which is pretty funny to me.

**[20:02] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it's certainly a pretty major kind of kind of undertaking there. Um, but uh, but yeah there has always been a you know a large sort of cultural and artsy kind of part to it as well. Um, so, so yeah, I mean the thing I've been m. Mainly involved with there is uh, is this Museum of Ethereum. So uh, when you come into the venue you go through the main ticketing you, you. There is going to be a, an area which is called Biddle uh Alley New Biddle City which is kind of a ah, Blade Runnery sort of Futurescape somewhere like Meow Wolf or Harry Potter, um Diagon Alley kind of kind of vibes uh of going through this area and there are going to be various different uh, you know sub areas and zones in there. Um but yes one of the, one of the large ones there is, is Museum of Ethereum uh which we are sponsoring uh as our Golem. Golem of DevCon 0 presentation. uh age and then ourselves DevCon 1 era. So super OGs still going. Um, and it's a mixture of physical and uh, digital artifacts drawing largely from the early days of Ethereum. uh you know, bios and interviews and everything. Um also uh, some photos through 2014 largely from Taylor Goering, um also some of them from the Toronto Bitcoin Expo in uh, in April 2014. Um then the other thing I've been working on for that which I think is really really cool I've uh, called the Ethereum Time Machine. What I'm providing there is an authentic experience of uh, running original software. I have got two 2010 era white plastic MacBooks and two chunky ThinkPads. And um, so I was trying to get back to Frontier Software. Um, I can run Frontier Software. Um, however the second phase is actually mining. So the goal I had is can you run you know, 2015 era software on contemporary hardware? CPU, mine the chain back to life. So that's what I've been working on like in the background for a couple of months. Um, so basically like GPUs at first get the thing moving and then as it's moving the difficulties coming down and you're easing off. So I'm in, in the final phases of that I wanted to revive Frontier. Uh, sadly that's a very, very expensive proposition that maybe some other future sponsor would like to drop 15 or 20k of GPU on. But, but yes, I have revived Homestead. So you know what you'll have there is running Mist. Running Mist at Homestead, CPU mine transactions back and forth, sitting there getting you know, the real experience of 10 year old software. Original chain, original protocol. So that was, that was, that was fun.

**[24:10] SPEAKER_04:** Optional in the real experience or like, I'm sorry, is pulling out your hair in frustration optional or required experience? Because I remember a lot of that myself.

**[24:22] SPEAKER_00:** I'm just hoping they don't crash too often.

**[24:24] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I, I remember Mist crashing a lot like I, when we, we were playing around with it.

**[24:31] SPEAKER_00:** So yes, there will be reboot uh, instructions uh, on, on hand. So there's, there's also.

**[24:39] SPEAKER_04:** Are you gonna be doing tech support on hand too?

**[24:43] SPEAKER_00:** I hope not. I hope to have left sufficient instructions that competent people can keep it going. Otherwise there might be some downtime. But yeah, so there's also a big chunk which uh, Jessica Angel, the creative director has taken the lead on. Ah, to do with some orbs that you can put your hands on and reach consensus between each other and light up different phases. Um, and then there is also a centerpiece which is still in motion. So I won't talk about. But uh, but yeah, uh, you know the hope is that a good chunk of those 20,000 people are gonna, are gonna walk in and they're gonna experience a bit of uh, a bit of Ethereum history really uh, touching on those early days and people that they may have got no clue were around, um, and have a little bit of a flavor of, of what that year was like and get your hands on and.

**[25:49] SPEAKER_04:** And you're speaking on the main stage about it too. Right?

**[25:51] SPEAKER_00:** So like I am talking about early days of Ethereum as well. Yeah, that's on there's, there's, there's a stage that's like storytelling or culture. I can't remember quite what, what that was called. It's called like New France Stage I think. So, uh, so yeah, I uh, I'll be giving a little talk there though. Likely what I'll do is, is play some ancient videos for people's amusement. There are, there's really fun stuff from the very early days uh, that a lot of people again they, they, they won't have seen. I mean particularly that Toronto Bitcoin Expo. So that was, that was in April 2014 and it was like the second time probably that most of the people on the team had met each other. You know some, some had met in Miami in the January and then some again met uh, in that uh, April. But at that point Ethereum was, it was like a company. So Ethereum were the headline sponsors for that event and they had a booth and they like gave away hundreds or thousands of T shirts and flyers. And so it was uh, you know it was the Ethereum company for the one and only time that you ever had that. But with a new EF being engaged again that's, they're not being the company but they are starting to uh, you know to have a presence at events again which, which I think is a very positive uh, thing to see. You know that engagement, you know they're obviously never going to have an EF stand up token or what have you but having a presence at ETH Denver and ECC absolutely makes sense. So hopefully they'll, they'll have a good presence.

**[27:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, no, I mean we're looking forward to see you speak Bob, but um, I remember like, I think you were kind of planning the same, I mean or like also speaking about Ethereum, early days at uh, DevConnect, but then there was like like all issues with like the Wi Fi or something or the Internet. I remember. So I hope this time that like the Internet is going to be good because I remember like DevConnect. So many people just left the main venue again because they couldn't do anything. Like it was super badly the Internet and you can say okay it's like Argentina but I mean come on like they should have like at least decent, decent type of Internet. Hopefully.

**[28:19] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, yeah, it will not be a problem in Denver I can assure you that. You know they've, they've got good, they've been there a good chunk of time and they, they know what they're doing. But yeah, the Wi Fi in Argentina was, was dreadful.

**[28:36] SPEAKER_04:** I Mean we, we went to off site coffee shops for Wi Fi and you know so I don't think it was a general Argentina problem. It was definitely ah a problem.

**[28:45] SPEAKER_00:** I think it was just like a capacity problem because there were so many people there. Ah and I mean the, the problem specifically at the Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress was they only got in the venue like two or three hours before the event. It was an absolute like rush job. Um but yeah, yeah I mean they.

**[29:02] SPEAKER_01:** They did everything on like the volunteers. I mean they had like so many volunteers because of course like the most of the core organization of ETH was just traveling. I mean it was at the beginning of DevConnect so so most of the people were just arriving um and they said okay we're going to let it uh be run by, by volunteers to set up all. So yeah, maybe there was like an issue but I mean it was great. Just like I think you just unfortunately couldn't do your talk there. But um, yeah, hopefully to see in Denver would be amazing.

**[29:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah I mean uh, I, that talk I will record, I will re record with them at some point. That still hasn't happened. Um but yeah, I mean it was just a bit of a mess on the day but yeah Denver's fine. I mean they've been planning it for perfect forever. Um so yeah, what's happening with Book of Ethereum? How's things in your world?

**[29:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I mean we're trying uh to manage the winter period of crypto as we speak. Uh, I mean it's crazy times actually. Um but we're doing our best. We're managing things um, just focusing on building the community. Um really making time to invest in community building. I think it's like super important. Um, I see these months of a big chance to improve UX, improve onboarding strategies because I feel like that's something that really we still miss. Um, if I speak in general crypto, Ethereum specifically also. Um, I mean because they always speak about the millions of people we're still missing out on board but then you also need to do something about it. Um and I see like these times are, are pretty good to do it. Um I mean like there's slow volume days. Um, markets are like terrible at the moment. So yeah it is what it is so we need to look at other things to do now
