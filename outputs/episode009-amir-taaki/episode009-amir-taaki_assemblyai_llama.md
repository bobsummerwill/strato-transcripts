**[00:03] SPEAKER_00:** Hello, hello, hello, hello. Great to see you, my friend. So we are here. We are here in Prague, in beautiful Prague, Dark Prague. The inaugural Dark Prague 0 Congress conference. I'm not quite sure what you'd call it, but yeah, delighted to talk to you today, really within a context of, of this early days of Ethereum project that I've been looking at. And one of the things I remember seeing earliest was the two Amirs that you had. Capitalist Amir and anarchist Amir. So tell me, you know, before all that started even, you know, how did your.

**[00:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, how come you're doing this project?

**[00:58] SPEAKER_00:** How come I'm doing it?  Well, it was quite. I mean, it's quite coincidental. You know, I'd gathered a bunch of information back in 2017, 2018, basically because Ming Chan was getting hoofed out and I asked Vitalik if what I could do to help, you know, anything with. Help with the transition or whatever, and he said, can you, can you like, go and talk to people in the community and sort of see what they think the Ethereum foundation should be like, what should we be doing?

**[01:38] SPEAKER_01:** Oh dear. If you ask that question, it's already a bad sign.

**[01:42] SPEAKER_00:** Well, my question at that thought, at that point was, so Ming was terrible. She's one of the least professional people I've ever worked with. She was an absolute nightmare. And my thought was, well, what the hell was happening before that? That she looked like a good choice. And there was a real sort of shroud of mystery as to what had happened then, even though it was only like three or four years before. And so like there just was no canonical history. Nobody really knew what happened. Even something as basic as, like, was Charles like kind of a co-founder or not? He kind of says he was maybe, but maybe he wasn't, which is just crazy because, you know, he was there like doing videos and like there's just tons of evidence. But anyway, so I started digging back into Anthony Di Iorio. Yes, that's right. There were three.

**[02:39] SPEAKER_01:** Didn't he get rocked or something?

**[02:40] SPEAKER_00:** There were, there was, there was Anthony Di Iorio.  There was Anthony D'Onofrio, that was Texture, and there was another guy called Anthony Euphemio who did this Digix Gold thing. But anyway, so I. That's where I started, like getting interested in Ethereum history is just like, well, what the hell happened? I mean the. What ended up happening is everything I recommended to Vitalik, like, never happened. Like, it was just completely a disaster. You Know, Ming went and he just got Aya. Here you go. It's a new one. No changes. Like the, the. The. What people wanted was like transparency. They wanted community input. They wanted like professional executive, like operational. It's like, you know, let's have organization to help the devs, basically. But primarily it was like, don't be a Swiss opaque foundation with no accountability or any public information at all. Anyway, so I put the stuff aside at that point. It's like, great. That was a good use of my time, you know, advising the millionaire for free for months. But then just recently, so guys I now work with, they started recording some videos because. So Kieran is. Kieran James Lubin is Joe's son. So he was actually around from March 2014 and the others were sort of involved from 2015. And they were just like, we should like get some of these memories down. Right? It was like eight years ago at that point. So they did a couple of those videos and I, you know, I really loved them and I was making tons of notes and finding links and photos and all of this, and then they interviewed me for the third one. But then more recently, I did interviews with Taylor Gehring and with Texture and just tons of stuff came out of that. And then I just kind of like shoved those together and there you go. That's early days of Ethereum is this sort of combination of sort of biographical stuff and photos and videos, links to articles and then, you know, conversations with people. And it's really just because it's like, this is history, right? This stuff was crazy.

**[05:16] SPEAKER_01:** Seeing being in crypto since like, you know, almost the beginning, and seeing the stuff that happens, but seeing what got recorded, right? And it's like, wow, like history really is just written by the victors. Yeah, it's just crazy.

**[05:35] SPEAKER_00:** So the. This. The one thing on that score which I don't know if you know, is. So the original Bitcoin talk post for announcing Ethereum. So that was done on 23rd January 2014, right. Just before the Bitcoin Miami. That page got changed. Oh, about, about eight months later, probably around August, September. It got. It got quick edited and a whole load of people that were there got written out.

**[06:13] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, you mean like just somebody they.

**[06:16] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I mean, I guess you can edit Bitcoin talk pages, but what about.

**[06:22] SPEAKER_01:** The people getting deleted and stuff?

**[06:24] SPEAKER_00:** So, yeah, just a whole bunch of people got deleted out.

**[06:27] SPEAKER_01:** By who? The admins?

**[06:29] SPEAKER_00:** Well, by Vitalik, I imagine.

**[06:31] SPEAKER_01:** But how do you edit people out of your thread?

**[06:34] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, the original post Said, hey, we're Ethereum, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This is the team, this is what we're doing.

**[06:42] SPEAKER_01:** I see.

**[06:43] SPEAKER_00:** I. So that post, which at the start went, look, here's about the 30 people that are working on things, went down to. Oh, right, Charles and Amir. Well, Amir I don't think was in the original post because he didn't want to be. But. But Charles got edited out, Stefan and Taylor Guerin got edited in, and all the rest of the team got shoved off the page. Yeah, but, you know, many, many people that were involved early, you know, they're just like forgotten. You know, they were on. You know, if you go back to early Internet archive versions, you can find some names. So, I mean, some people, like Mr. Ryan Taylor over here. So Ryan worked on all the early websites for months. You know, these. These pages that thousands or tens of thousands of people have seen. As you know, this is the main Ethereum page. Nobody knew who did it. I didn't know. Like, you know, just on one of the early ones, just for a little while, it just said like, Ryan Taylor Webb. I know who Ryan Taylor is. Like, so a number of these names, you know, I don't know who they are or maybe start to find them. And basically, you know, it's. It's like the work of. Of many hands. Right? This was something I was talking about is, you know, you've got like, great man theory, right? The thought that you have these exceptional people and by amazing powers of, you know, intellectual skills and power of force, that they bend the universe to their will. And, you know, that's kind of the story that people like Feudalism.

**[08:24] SPEAKER_01:** It's like, you pledge your allegiance to his liege.

**[08:28] SPEAKER_00:** That's right.  Or if you, you know, tech world operate. Yeah, well, you know, like, people are looking for heroes and, you know, they're champions to cheer, you know, in the. In the highest case, you know, something like North Korea. They literally think the leader is, you know, is a God. You know, they're just crying in front of him, just, oh, so amazing. So, yeah, I'm. I'm trying to record the real truth and give people their voices and. And just make sure stuff doesn't get lost. Right. So many things have already been lost.

**[09:11] SPEAKER_01:** Pete Rizzo did that for Bitcoin, right? He's like. He did really, really deep history of Bitcoin stuff.

**[09:18] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. So check him out as well. Yeah, so. So, yeah, I'm Finding stuff. And you know, you shared your old YouTube channel with me as well. You seem to have a reasonable number of artifacts of various ages that have been preserved about you.

**[09:39] SPEAKER_01:** Funny, because I was just filming and I was just putting it. My video camera on the Internet on YouTube. So that's why I have that page.

**[09:49] SPEAKER_00:** Right. It's. It's funny. There's a. There's a guy called Freddy Hartline who was one of the guys that started the main. Kind of like it was like Bitcoin co-working space or whatever in Vancouver. But he was saying he's got loads of stuff on his Facebook account of all things basically. Even though it's like as boomer as you can imagine, it's like, yep, loads of other people have had things on so many other platforms and everything, they've all got lost and fucked. I've just posted shit on my Facebook page and it's, you know, it's, it's up there forever. Obviously, like preserving things yourself is way better than relying on any of these platforms. But yeah, like so much stuff has just like rotted because people have deleted their accounts or like a platform isn't around anymore or just you know, general, general kind of rot.

**[10:49] SPEAKER_01:** But everything I have from this survived is because I uploaded it to like a, A normie platform.

**[10:56] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. Well, this is it.

**[10:58] SPEAKER_01:** I like periodically have like a, A cleanse cleansing like a non. It's not accidental, but it's just like every few years, you know, your data is just reset to zero.

**[11:09] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, sucks. Well that's it. Yeah, I mean that. So yeah, that was Freddy's super normie story. Is still using Facebook even though you know it's Facebook. So yeah, I mean, you know, you were, you were a free software guy and a general developer on that thread and early, early Bitcoin dev. So like how did you find Bitcoin?

**[11:45] SPEAKER_01:** So I was, yeah, I was working on free software for five, six years and then off. And then I became a professional poker player.

**[11:57] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[11:59] SPEAKER_01:** That was for over two years. And the poker sites, you know, you're playing against other players.

**[12:04] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[12:06] SPEAKER_01:** But the way the sites operate the platform, they take a cut out of every, every pot, basically every game that you play.

**[12:15] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[12:16] SPEAKER_01:** So. But the sites charge a huge amount of fees for like a really crappy service. So I had this idea, what if you could have a P2P site, then it wouldn't have rake and fees.

**[12:29] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[12:30] SPEAKER_01:** So I had like the design for it, but then the main issue was the payment system. And so then I was on IRC in this channel with other anarcho hackers. I know. And I was telling them about that. And this guy just is like a mathematician that worked for the W3C. His Melvin, he dumped just like 10 links in there. And, you know, they're like random open source projects for, like, money. And there's stuff like lets. Have you heard of lets?

**[13:06] SPEAKER_00:** No, no.

**[13:06] SPEAKER_01:** That was at one point. People, like, really into that. But it's like you. But off. I think it's like offering your labor. You get like a token or something. But anyway, so I would say going for one of all of these links and they're going, no, no, no, no. I saw Bitcoin. I opened the page for Bitcoin. He goes, Bitcoin is a P2P currency that cannot be controlled by governments or central banks. And then I was like, that's garbage. Like, obviously not. That's just because there's like loads of random projects like that on Sourceforge. Back in the day, like, once saw like a Jurassic park video game, and it was going like, you could do everything. You can punch through the walls, you can hack the terminals, you can hunt the dinosaurs. And I, like. I was like, whoa, sounds amazing. And I checked the code and it said, like, main cpp. And they had like, just, you know, like one file. Yeah. Like, just got. It got bored of it. It, like it just wrote the idea.

**[14:10] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right.

**[14:11] SPEAKER_01:** And then, like, I kept checking months every so often, and there's like zero progress on that. So I thought Bitcoin was like, one of those kind of projects.

**[14:19] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[14:19] SPEAKER_01:** I went, no, no, no. And then I was like, oh, they're all shit. So I was like, okay, let's take a deeper look at all of them then. And so then when it came to Bitcoin one, I downloaded the source code and I started going through the source code and I was like, oh, it's really interesting. First of all, Bitcoin source code is about 15,000 lines of code time.

**[14:38] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[14:39] SPEAKER_01:** Which, you know, 15,000 lines of code. It's actually a small amount of lines of code. Like, some programmers can even do that in like a week or something. Like, very talented programs. But. So I was like, oh, but it's not nothing, Evo. It's not like that Jurassic park game I was just describing. So it's like 20, you know, 15,000 lines of code. Like, let's.

**[15:01] SPEAKER_00:** You can. You can read through and kind of understand.

**[15:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So I printed it all out and I covered it all over my floor.

**[15:06] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[15:06] SPEAKER_01:** You Know, it's like my pornography that I'm looking at. I started studying it.

**[15:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[15:11] SPEAKER_01:** And it started to make sense. I was like, oh, very interesting. Oh, interesting. And so when I figured out how it worked, I was like, whoa, this is amazing. I'm gonna work on this. Like. And so then.

**[15:22] SPEAKER_00:** So what month do you think that was?

**[15:24] SPEAKER_01:** That was the summer of 2010.

**[15:26] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[15:26] SPEAKER_01:** So that's when I like, basically I was like, okay, I'm just doing this amount. And so then I had like a. So I made like a plan of like, oh, in 10 years we'll be here, etc.

**[15:38] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[15:39] SPEAKER_01:** Because I was like, this is like a long term thing I'm going to work on. But then that basically just happened really quickly. Like just started growing massively. So it's pretty crazy. But I started working on Bitcoin, started writing code. You know, I was one of the first five Bitcoin developers, which I was like listed on Bitcoin Dog.

**[15:57] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[15:57] SPEAKER_01:** But that page is gone. Gone from the Internet. So people.

**[16:00] SPEAKER_00:** It's like maybe. Maybe it got archived.

**[16:03] SPEAKER_01:** No, I don't think so.

**[16:04] SPEAKER_00:** No, just gone.

**[16:05] SPEAKER_01:** Bitcoin web page with the list of names.

**[16:07] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[16:08] SPEAKER_01:** So like, I had a war with Gavin Andreessen.

**[16:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yep.

**[16:11] SPEAKER_01:** Because he was like a. He's a like in many ways. But basically he really likes regulations and the state and stuff like that. He's a statist and he's let into the banks and stuff. But also he was just not that good a dev. And when there was like other young devs that were coming up, instead of trying to like nurture them, he was instead, like trying to push them out and try and keep control. So I became like his main enemy, basically. I was like his first enemy. And then he kind of seemed like.

**[16:42] SPEAKER_00:** He never wanted the role even. He just sort of got.

**[16:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, he kind of locked into it.

**[16:47] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[16:47] SPEAKER_01:** And then he was there and he's like, oh, I want to keep it. I really like it. He know. So, yeah, I like went to the very first event presenting Bitcoin to it was to an audience of bankers. And so I did my talking afterwards. Gavin Andreessen, he DM me and he goes, I think you should not talk at conferences ever again. I was like, who the is this guy? You're not in charge of project. You.

**[17:14] SPEAKER_00:** But was this in London or in the US Somewhere? Amsterdam.

**[17:17] SPEAKER_01:** Right. But anyway, so you know, one of the first things that Gav Andreessen did.

**[17:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[17:25] SPEAKER_01:** Was to try and get my name off of that list. Name added. But anyway, Right. So he was like that. And.

**[17:35] SPEAKER_00:** You know, I mean, did you end up starting Libbitcoin quite early then?

**[17:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, 2011. Yeah, yeah. Mid like March 2011 or something.

**[17:46] SPEAKER_00:** And was that around the same time as BIPs? Was that kind of like you were coordinating that? It's kind of like, right, we need, we need specs, we need multiple clients.

**[17:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Because Gavin saw Bitcoin not as an open source project but as a startup.

**[18:04] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[18:04] SPEAKER_01:** So he's like, we need to like pull ranks and we need to like make these features and changes so we can make a payment system that's fast.

**[18:13] SPEAKER_00:** Make a road map.

**[18:15] SPEAKER_01:** I. I don't know, it was more like just he wanted to operate it like a business.

**[18:19] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[18:20] SPEAKER_01:** And so I was like very worried because he was, because he wasn't treating it like an open source protocol. It was like, we need to add this thing, we need to add that thing. So I was like, there need to be some constraint on his like, like wild ideas. So that's why I proposed that system. And thing is like, Gavin, I mean, I don't want to talk about people. But anyway, yeah, so I made that BIP system for that reason was. I was just afraid of that direction. That side of Bitcoin which they later made a foundation y and they put themselves as chief scientist and they tried to do this. It was takeover of business guys on Bitcoin. And yeah, they wanted, they were like, we have to push out the anarchists. Yeah, it was this like, it's like this attitude of like, oh, these crazy anarchists, they've invented this like new plaything and it's just so it's like really interesting toy and if we can just pry it out of their hands, then we can get it accepted by big banks and then it can do something useful. Whereas our side.

**[19:28] SPEAKER_00:** You're putting people off, huh? You're putting people off. All this anarchist talk, you know?

**[19:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly.

**[19:34] SPEAKER_00:** We're trying, we're trying to sell this thing.

**[19:36] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I had. So our side was like more like, oh, this is like an actual new economic paradigm.

**[19:42] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[19:43] SPEAKER_01:** And you know, so it's interesting because now all the Bitcoin maxis are very Bitcoin maxi. But on, for example, when I first met Peter Willer or SIPA, one of the core devs of Bitcoin in 2011, I was talking to him in the conference and he says, he says, oh, I'm not really interested in the monetary aspect of Bitcoin.

**[20:09] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[20:10] SPEAKER_01:** I'm more interested just in the scripting language.

**[20:13] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, right.

**[20:14] SPEAKER_01:** It enables smart contracts and programmability. Yeah, he wasn't interested in the money thing.

**[20:20] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[20:20] SPEAKER_01:** So this new Bitcoin fanatic ideology. Yeah, it's like retroactive. Back then people in Bitcoin were like, oh, we want to explore.

**[20:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[20:30] SPEAKER_01:** What you can do, you know.

**[20:31] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I mean for the longest time there was this thought that, you know, all innovation that happens elsewhere will come back to Bitcoin. Right. It's, it's inevitable. You know, we don't have to be like pushing anything ourselves because you know, like, it'll just all, all come home.

**[20:47] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. The problem with Bitcoin is the, it became taken over by these people that they like going to conferences, right. It's like, you know, they see people they know, you know, a lot of, you know, culty massive Bitcoin people, you know, they will want to like, like, oh I love you, you're amazing. You know, like, and these people, they're not interested in the bigger mission or sense of. It's like it's about themselves. And so Bitcoin got taken over by these like influencers essentially.

**[21:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[21:23] SPEAKER_01:** And the thing is when somebody come and says, you know, let's do something big, let's rock the boat. Yeah, they're going to see that as an enemy because, and that's why Bitcoin is so conservative is because it's been, it's been taken over by this class of people.

**[21:39] SPEAKER_00:** There was like sailors, like absolutely the worst for this. There was a little video of him I saw the other day or yesterday which was saying the biggest risk to Bitcoin is like competent and enthusiastic devs.

**[21:59] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I need to see the full quote because that sounds ridiculous.

**[22:03] SPEAKER_00:** But he basically seems to have gone for this absolute full on ossification of saying, you know, these developers, they want to actually change things and that's a problem. We should never change anything. We need to be thinking in hundred year timelines because you know, this is the proof of, sorry, this is the, you know, the store of value that's going to save humanity. And that's. And that's all there is, right, that, that store of value narrative and don't use it, don't use your Bitcoin.

**[22:46] SPEAKER_01:** Well, the thing is there's this book in the 90s which is the sovereign individual.

**[22:51] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[22:52] SPEAKER_01:** I'm not saying I agree with all the book, but it does, it does make interesting analysis. It's definitely worth studying. And it says that Israel in 1997 and it's talking about cryptocurrency and it's saying how the invention of cryptography will enable the proliferation of markets like cyber markets in cyberspace.

**[23:16] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[23:17] SPEAKER_01:** And the capital will become hyper liquid and you know, will be able to flow from any place to any other place and the governments would lose their power.

**[23:26] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[23:26] SPEAKER_01:** Taxes capital, or control this capital.

**[23:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[23:29] SPEAKER_01:** And therefore it would like inherently change the logic of violence.

**[23:35] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[23:36] SPEAKER_01:** And yet, and this is also a very big idea in originally in crypto as well, you know, early days of Bitcoin, people would always bring out this up, this book, and yet it hasn't come to fruition.

**[23:53] SPEAKER_00:** So.

**[23:56] SPEAKER_01:** You know, just, just in case it hasn't come to fruition. And so we have to ask ourselves why? Like I don't think, I don't think the thesis is wrong. I just, I think the thing that they missed was surveillance.

**[24:15] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[24:15] SPEAKER_01:** Because the surveillance apparatus obviously can monitor all the flows, all the activity of people. And if you can do that, then, Then you, then now you have law enforcement.

**[24:36] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[24:37] SPEAKER_01:** So yeah.

**[24:43] SPEAKER_00:** And you know, you pause a sec for sure.

**[24:48] SPEAKER_01:** I just need to listen to this.

**[24:52] SPEAKER_00:** So, you know, from what I could see, you know, you started traveling around the world a bit. Right. You, you were in various different places at different times. I mean, were you, you know, you going around meeting different people, like building, you know, building different things. How, how, how was that?

**[25:13] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was traveling a bit. I actually come from a movement of anarchist hackers in Europe which were living in squatted buildings.

**[25:26] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[25:27] SPEAKER_01:** So you know, there's like, in Europe there's all these squatters laws which if a building is like abandoned, you can like move into the building and some, some squats, they last for years.

**[25:39] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[25:40] SPEAKER_01:** And we'd get amazing buildings. So in Amsterdam we had like a huge house.

**[25:45] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[25:46] SPEAKER_01:** Imagine we're working on free software, you know, we're broke devs.

**[25:51] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[25:51] SPEAKER_01:** It's like really, it's really useful lifeline to have. And also like living in the center of the cities. I mean like now even working in crime crypto, I look at the price of property and like it's ridiculous. Yeah, yeah, it's like really ridiculous. I think like societies really need that kind of stuff, like support people working on projects and software and stuff like that. It's a shame we don't. But anyway, I was part of those hacker movements, so I had like lots of places in Europe I could go to. You know, we would have communities, people working on free software. You know, in, in Barcelona, in London.

**[26:32] SPEAKER_00:** London, I saw. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when did your focus switch to Dark Wallet?

**[26:43] SPEAKER_01:** So actually I made the first CoinJoin and Stealth implementations in Bitcoin, which are the very first privacy techniques. And so I was working on Bitcoin implementations, nodes, but I was also focused on the privacy. So I already did those projects before.

**[27:03] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[27:04] SPEAKER_01:** And then the Dark Wallet, I was like, we need to create a product. Like, we need to create like a wallet or something.

**[27:09] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[27:10] SPEAKER_01:** So that's why, you know, we made the Dark Wallet.

**[27:16] SPEAKER_00:** And when did you first meet Vitalik? Can you remember?

**[27:21] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was so, I was like, I say I was living in these squats around Europe.

**[27:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[27:25] SPEAKER_01:** So after 2012, then. Then there was like, okay. There was like a friend I met many, many years ago when I was hitchhiking and he was really cool dude. And I just saw him randomly on the Internet and I was like, bro, I'm making a conference. Come to my conference. He's like, okay. And I didn't hear back from him.

**[27:46] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[27:46] SPEAKER_01:** It turns out he likes. He just. He walked onto a ferry without any documentation from. He came from Estonia across Europe.

**[27:53] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[27:54] SPEAKER_01:** He came into England and he was like. He now looked like Jesus and he had like long hair and long beard and stuff.

**[28:00] SPEAKER_00:** Didn't look good for an entry.

**[28:02] SPEAKER_01:** Anyway, Mihai.

**[28:03] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah.

**[28:04] SPEAKER_01:** Met him at the conference and was like enchanted by him. He was like, I just met this guy, your friend. He looks like Jesus, man.
