**[00:03] SPEAKER_02:** Hello, hello.

**[00:04] SPEAKER_00:** Hello, hello. Great to see you, my friend. So we are here. We are here in Prague, in beautiful Prague. Dark Prague, the inaugural Dark Prague Zero Congress, conference, I'm not quite sure what you'd call it. But yeah, delighted to talk to you today, really within a context of this early days of Ethereum project that I've been looking at. And one of the things I remember seeing earliest was the two EMEAs that you had: capitalist Amir and anarchist Amir. So tell me, you know, before all that started even, you know, how did yours—yeah, how come you're doing this project? How come I'm doing it? Yeah, well, it was quite—I mean, it was quite coincidental. You know, I'd gathered a bunch of information back in 2017, 2018, basically because Ming Chan was getting hoofed out and I asked Vitalik what I could do to help with the transition or whatever. And he said, can you go and talk to people in the community and sort of see what they think the Ethereum Foundation should be? Like, what should we be doing?

**[01:38] SPEAKER_02:** Oh dear, if you ask that question, it's already a bad sign.

**[01:42] SPEAKER_00:** Well, my question at that point was, so Ming was terrible. She was one of the least professional people I've ever worked with. She was an absolute nightmare. And my thought was, well... what the hell was happening before that, that she looked like a good choice. And there was a real sort of shroud of mystery as to what had happened then, even though it was only like three or four years before. And so like, there just was no canonical history. Nobody really knew what happened. Even something as basic as like, was Charles like kind of a co-founder or not? He kind of says he was maybe, but maybe he wasn't. Which is just crazy because, you know, he was there, like, doing videos and, like, there's just tons of evidence. But anyway, so I started digging back into that stuff.

**[02:35] SPEAKER_02:** What about Anthony Di Iorio as well?

**[02:37] SPEAKER_00:** Anthony Di Iorio, yes, that's right.

**[02:39] SPEAKER_02:** Didn't he get rocked or something?

**[02:41] SPEAKER_00:** There was Anthony Di Iorio.

**[02:43] SPEAKER_02:** I don't know the history.

**[02:44] SPEAKER_00:** There was Anthony D'Onofrio that was Texture. And there was another guy called Anthony Euphamio who did this Digix Gold thing. But anyway, that's where I started getting interested in Ethereum history. It's just like, well, what the hell happened? I mean, what ended up happening is everything I recommended to Vitalik never happened. It was just completely... a disaster. You know, Ming went and he just got Aya. Here you go, it's a new one, no changes. Like, what people wanted was transparency. They wanted community input. They wanted professional executive—like, operational. It's like, you know, let's have an organization to help the devs basically. But primarily it was like, don't be a Swiss opaque foundation with no accountability or any public information at all. Anyway, so I put the stuff aside at that point. It's like, great, that was a good use of my time, you know, advising the millionaire for free for months. But then just recently, the guys I now work with, they started recording some videos because, so Kieren James Lubin is Joe's son. So he was actually around from March 2014, and the others were sort of involved from 2015, and they were just like, we should like, get some of these memories down, right? It was like eight years ago at that point. So they did a couple of those videos and I really loved them and I was making tons of notes and finding links and photos and all of this. And then they interviewed me for the third one. But then more recently, I did interviews with Taylor Goering and with Texture. And just tons of stuff came out of that. And then I just kind of like shoved those together. And there you go. That's Early Days of Ethereum, is this sort of combination of sort of biographical stuff and photos and videos, links to articles. And then, you know, conversations with people. And it's really just because it's like this is history, right?

**[05:13] SPEAKER_02:** This stuff was crazy, seeing, being in crypto since like you know almost the beginning and seeing the stuff that happens but seeing what got recorded right and it's like wow, like history really is just written by the victors. Yeah, it's just it's crazy.

**[05:35] SPEAKER_00:** So the one thing on that score, which I don't know if you know, is so the original BitcoinTalk post for announcing Ethereum, so that was done on the 23rd of January 2014, right, just before the Bitcoin Miami. That page got changed. Oh, what the fuck? About eight months later, probably around August, September, it got quick edited. And a whole load of people that were there got written out. Oh, you mean like just somebody they well, I mean, I guess you can edit BitcoinTalk pages.

**[06:22] SPEAKER_02:** But what about the people getting deleted and stuff?

**[06:24] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, just a whole bunch of people got deleted out by who the admins? Well, by Vitalik, I imagine.

**[06:31] SPEAKER_02:** But how do you edit people out of your thread?

**[06:35] SPEAKER_00:** No, no. The original post said, hey, we're Ethereum, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This is the team. This is what we're doing. So that post, which at the start went, look, here's about the 30 people that are working on things, went down to, oh, right, Charles and Amir. Well, Amir, I don't think, was in the original post because he didn't want to be. But Charles got edited out. Stefan and Taylor Goering got edited in and all the rest of the team got shoved off the page. Yeah. But, you know, many, many people that were involved early, you know, they're just like forgotten. You know, they were on, you know, if you go back to early Internet Archive versions, you can find some names. So, I mean, some people... Like Mr. Ryan Taylor over here. So Ryan worked on all the early websites for months. You know, these pages that thousands or tens of thousands of people have seen as, you know, this is the main Ethereum page. Nobody knew who did it. I didn't know. Like, you know, just on one of the early ones, just for a little while, it just said, like, Ryan Taylor Webb. I don't know who Ryan Taylor is. Like, so a number of these names, you know, I don't know who they are or maybe start to find them. And basically, you know, it's like the work of many hands, right? This is something I was talking about is, you know, you've got, like, great man theory, right? The thought that you have these exceptional people and by amazing powers of, you know, intellectual skills and power of force that they bend the universe to their will. And, you know, that's kind of the story that people like.

**[08:23] SPEAKER_02:** It's kind of like feudalism. It's like... You pledge your allegiance to his liege.

**[08:28] SPEAKER_00:** That's right.

**[08:29] SPEAKER_02:** And if your liege becomes popular, you will gain through him. You will live vicariously.

**[08:38] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[08:39] SPEAKER_02:** That's how the tech world operates.

**[08:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well, you know, like people are looking for heroes and, you know, they're champions to cheer. You know, in the highest case, you know, something like North Korea, they literally think the leader is, you know, is a god. You know, they're just crying in front of him, just... Wow, that's amazing. So, yeah, I'm trying to record the real truth and give people their voices and just make sure stuff doesn't get lost, right? So many things have already been lost.

**[09:11] SPEAKER_02:** Pete Rizzo did that for Bitcoin. Right. He did really, really deep history of Bitcoin stuff.

**[09:19] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. So... You should check him out as well. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm finding stuff. And, you know, you shared your old YouTube channel with me as well. You seem to have a reasonable number of artefacts of various ages that have been preserved about you.

**[09:39] SPEAKER_02:** It's funny because I was just filming and I was just putting my video camera on the internet on YouTube. So that's why I have that page.

**[09:48] SPEAKER_00:** Right. It's funny. There's a guy called Freddie Hartline who was one of the guys that started the main kind of like, it was like Bitcoin co-working space or whatever in Vancouver. But he was saying he's got loads of stuff on his Facebook account of all things. Basically, even though it's like as boomer as you can imagine, it's like, yep, loads of other people have had things on so many other platforms and everything. They've all got lost and fucked. I've just posted shit on my Facebook page and it's, you know, it's up there forever. Obviously, like preserving things yourself is way better than relying on any of these platforms. But yeah, like so much stuff is just like rotted because people have deleted their accounts or like a platform isn't around anymore or just, you know, general, general kind of rot. But, uh,

**[10:50] SPEAKER_02:** Everything I have that's survived is because I uploaded it to a normie platform. Yes, this is it. I periodically have a cleansing. It's not accidental, but it's just like every few years, your data just resets to zero. I don't know, it sucks, but you know.

**[11:12] SPEAKER_00:** Well, that's it. Yeah. I mean, so yeah, that was Freddie's super normie story is still using Facebook even though, you know, it's Facebook. So, yeah, I mean, you know, you were a free software guy and a general developer on that thread and early Bitcoin dev. So how did you find Bitcoin?

**[11:45] SPEAKER_02:** So I was working on free software for five, six years. And then I became a professional poker player.

**[11:57] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[11:58] SPEAKER_02:** That was for over two years. And the poker sites, you know, you're playing against other players. Right. But the way the sites operate, the platform, they take a cut out of every pot, basically, every game that you play. Right. But the sites charge a huge amount of fees for a really crappy service. So I had this idea, what if you could have a P2P site, then it wouldn't have rake and fees. Right. So I had like the design for it, but then the main issue was the payment system. And so then I was on IRC in this channel with other Anarcho-hackers, I know. And I was telling them about that. And this guy is like a mathematician that worked for the W3C. His name's Melvin. He dumped just like 10 links in there. And they're like random open source projects for money. And there's stuff like Letts. Have you heard of Letts? No, no. At one point, people were really into that. But it's like... you but off I think it's like offering your labor you get like a token or something but anyway so I would say going through one of all of these links and they're going no no no no I saw Bitcoin I opened the page for Bitcoin it goes bitcoin is a foot is a p2p currency that cannot be controlled by governments or central banks and i was like that's garbage like obviously not that's just because there's like loads of random projects like that on the source forge back in the day like i once saw like a jurassic park video game and it was going like you could do everything you can punch through the walls you can hack the terminals you can hunt the dinosaurs and i like i was like whoa sounds amazing and i checked the code and it said like main.cpp and they had like just you know like one file yeah like it just got it got bored of it it like got it just wrote the idea right right and then like i kept checking months every so often and And there was like zero progress on that. So I thought Bitcoin was like one of those kind of projects. I went, no, no, no. And then I was like, oh, they're all shit. So I was like, okay, let's take a deeper look at all of them then. And so then when it came to Bitcoin one, I downloaded the source code. And I started going through the source code. And I was like, oh, that's really interesting. First of all, Bitcoin source code is about 15,000 lines of code at that time. Which... you know, 15,000 lines of code, it's actually a small amount of lines of code. Like some programmers can even do that in like a week or something like very talented programmers. But so I was like, oh, but it's not nothing either. It's not like that Jurassic Park game I was just describing. So it's like 20, you know, 15,000 lines of code like less.

**[15:01] SPEAKER_00:** You can read through and kind of understand that pretty well.

**[15:04] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, so I printed it all out and I covered it all over my floor.

**[15:06] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[15:07] SPEAKER_02:** You know, it's like my pornography that I'm looking at. I started studying it.

**[15:11] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[15:11] SPEAKER_02:** And it started to make sense. I was like, oh, very interesting. Oh, interesting. And so when I figured out how it worked, I was like, whoa, this is amazing. I'm going to work on this.

**[15:22] SPEAKER_00:** So what month do you think that was?

**[15:24] SPEAKER_02:** That was the summer of 2010. Right. So that's when I, like, basically, I was like, okay, I'm just doing this from now on. And so then I had, like, I made, like, a plan of, like, oh, in 10 years we'll be here, et cetera.

**[15:38] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[15:39] SPEAKER_02:** Because this is like a long-term thing I'm going to work on. But then that basically just happened really quickly. It just started growing massively. So it was pretty crazy. But I started working on Bitcoin. I started writing code. I was one of the first five Bitcoin developers, which I was listed on Bitcoin.org. But that page is gone from the internet. So people, it's like, they don't like that.

**[16:01] SPEAKER_00:** Maybe it got archived.

**[16:03] SPEAKER_02:** No, I don't think so.

**[16:04] SPEAKER_00:** No, just gone.

**[16:05] SPEAKER_02:** Bitcoin web page with the list of names. Right. So I had a war with Gavin Andreessen. Yeah. Because he was like, he's a motherfucker in many ways. But basically, he really likes regulations and the state and stuff like that. He's a statist. And he's into the banks and stuff. But also, he was just not that good a dev. And when there was other young devs that were coming up, instead of trying to nurture them, he was instead trying to push them out and try and keep control. So I became his main enemy, basically. I was like his first enemy.

**[16:41] SPEAKER_00:** And then he kind of seemed like he never wanted the role. Even he just sort of got kind of locked into it.

**[16:47] SPEAKER_02:** And then he was there and he's like, I want to keep it. I really like it. I went to the very first event presenting Bitcoin to audience of bankers. And so I did my talk and afterwards Gavin Andrees and he DM me and he goes, I think you should not talk at conferences ever again. I was like, who the fuck is this guy? You're not in charge of your project. Fuck you.

**[17:14] SPEAKER_00:** Was this in London or in the US? Amsterdam. Amsterdam, right.

**[17:18] SPEAKER_02:** But anyway, so... You know, one of the first things that Gav Andreessen did was to try and get my name off of that list. He got his name added. But anyway, so he was like that. And, you know...

**[17:37] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, did you end up starting Libitcoin quite early then?

**[17:42] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, 2011, yeah. Like March 2011 or something.

**[17:46] SPEAKER_00:** And was that around the same time as Bips? Was that kind of like you were coordinating that? It's kind of like, right, we need specs, we need multiple clients.

**[17:56] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, because... gavin saw bitcoin not as an open source project but as a startup right so he's like we need to like pull ranks and we need to like make these features and changes so we can make a payment system that's fast make a roadmap Yeah, I don't know. It was more like he wanted to operate it like a business.

**[18:19] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[18:20] SPEAKER_02:** And so I was very worried because he wasn't treating it like an open source protocol. It was like, we need to add this thing, we need to add that thing. So I was like, there needs to be some constraint on his wild ideas. So that's why I proposed that system. And the thing is, like... Gavin, I mean, I don't want to talk shit about people, but anyway. Yeah, so I made that BIP system for that reason. I was just afraid of that direction, that side of Bitcoin, which they later made a foundation for. And they put themselves as chief scientist and they tried to do this takeover of business guys on Bitcoin. And they wanted they were like, we have to push out the anarchists. Yeah, it was just like it's like this attitude of like, oh, these crazy anarchists, they've invented this like new play thing. And it's just so it's like really interesting toy. And if we just pry out of their hands, then we can get it accepted by big banks and then it can do something useful. You're putting people off.

**[19:30] SPEAKER_00:** You're putting people off all this anarchist talk. We're trying to sell this thing.

**[19:36] SPEAKER_02:** yeah i had so our side was like more like oh this is like an actual new economic paradigm right and you know so it's interesting because uh now all the bitcoin maxi
