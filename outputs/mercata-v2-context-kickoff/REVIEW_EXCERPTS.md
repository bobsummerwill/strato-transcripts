**Intermediate:**

> Okay, so yeah, maybe we start. Yep. So yeah. Okay. Hi everyone. Good to have you here. I'm Bob Simwill. I'm the head of ecosystem at Strata Block Apps. Victor, who's with us here, is the chief Product officer and co founder. Mercator V2 is the new iteration of our application of our network, which has been a major focus for us this year, we spent the vast majority of this year rebuilding a completely new application experience. The current production mainnet is more of a ebayish kind of setup really coming out of an earlier period where we were having a marketplace of kind of like collectibles, tokenized whiskey barrels and other things which were more NFT like. The focus for V2 is really about high quality hard assets, specifically gold and silver.

So just for everyone's information, and since we're not going to talk about the weather, this is our first simulcast. It's happening on YouTube Live and Twitter Spaces. There was some behind-the-scenes wiring up of all this. And if anyone has poor audio or anything, please let us know, and we'll try and rectify it next time. So yeah, we're using StreamYard, which seems to be sort of the best answer there is.
