**Intermediate:**

> hello hello hello hello great to see you my friend so we are here we are here in prague in beautiful prague at dark prague the inaugural Dark Prague Zero Congress, conference, I'm not quite sure what you'd call it. But yeah, delighted to talk to you today, really within a context of this early days of Ethereum project that I've been looking at. And one of the things I remember seeing earliest was the two EMEAs that you had capitalist Amir and anarchist Amir. So tell me, you know, before all that started even, you know, how did your... Just curious, how come you're doing this project? How come I'm doing it? Yeah, yeah, what's the... Well, it was quite, I mean, it was quite coincidental, you know, I'd... I'd gathered a bunch of information back in 2017, 2018, basically because Ming Chan was getting hoofed out and I asked Vitalik if what I could do to help, you know, anything with help with the transition or whatever. And he said, can you can you like go and talk to people in the community and sort of see what they think the Ethereum Foundation should be like? What should we be doing? Oh dear, if you ask that question, it's already a bad sign. Well, my question at that point was, so Ming was terrible. She was one of the least professional people I've ever worked with. She was an absolute nightmare. And my thought was, well... what the hell was happening before that that she looked like a good choice and there was a real sort of shroud of mystery as to what happened then even though it was only like three or four years before and so like there just was no canonical history nobody really knew what happened even something as basic as like was Charles like kind of a co-founder or not he kind of says he was maybe but maybe he wasn't Which is just crazy. Because, you know, he was there, like, doing videos and, like, there's just tons of evidence. But anyway, so I started digging back into that stuff. What about Anthony Delorio as well? Anthony Delorio, yes, that's right. Didn't he get rocked or something? There was Anthony Delorio. I don't know the history. There was Anthony D'Onofrio that was Texture. And there was another guy called Anthony Euphamio who did this Digix Gold thing. But anyway, so that's where I started getting interested in Ethereum history. It's just like, well, what the hell happened? I mean, what ended up happening is everything I recommended to Vitalik never happened. It was just completely... a disaster. You know, Ming went and he just got AYA. Here you go. It's a new one. No changes. What people wanted was like transparency. They wanted community input. They wanted like professional executive, like operational. It's like, you know, let's have organization to help the devs basically. Um, but primarily it was like, don't be a Swiss opaque foundation with no accountability or any public information at all. Anyway, so I put the stuff aside at that point. It's like, great. That was a good use of my time, you know, advising the millionaire for free for months. Um, but then just recently, um, So the guys I now work with, they started recording some videos because, so Kieran is, Kieran James Lubin is Joe's son. So he was actually around from March 2014 and the others were sort of involved from 2015 and they were just like, we should like, get some of these memories down, right? It was like eight years ago at that point. So they did a couple of those videos and I really loved them and I was making tons of notes and finding links and photos and all of this. And then they interviewed me for the third one But then more recently, I did interviews with Taylor Goering and with Texture and just tons of stuff came out of that. And then I just kind of like shoved those together and there you go. That's early days of Ethereum is this sort of combination of sort of biographical stuff and photos and videos, links to articles, and then, you know, conversations with people. And it's really just because it's like this is history, right?

#### [25:13] SPEAKER_01 (block 18/35)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, I was traveling a bit. I actually come from a movement of anarchist hackers in Europe, which were living in squatted buildings. Right, right. So, you know, there's like in Europe, there's all these squatters laws, which if a building is like abandoned, you can move into the building. And some some squats, they last for years. Yeah. And we'd get amazing buildings. So in Amsterdam, we had a huge house. Imagine we're working on free software. We're broke devs. It's a really useful lifeline to have. and also like living in the center of the cities. I mean, like now even working in crypto, I look at the price of property and like it's ridiculous. Yeah. It's like really ridiculous. I think like societies really need that kind of stuff, like support people working on projects and software and stuff like that. It's a shame we don't. But anyway, I was part of those hacker movements, so I had, like, lots of places in Europe I could go to. You know, we would have communities, people working on free software, you know, in Barcelona, in London. London, I saw them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when did your focus switch to Dark Wallet? So actually I made the first CoinJoin and Stealth implementations in Bitcoin, which are the very first privacy techniques. So I was working on Bitcoin implementations nodes, but I was also focused on the privacy. So I already did those projects before. Right. And then the Dark Wallet, I was like, we need to create a product. Like, we need to create, like, a wallet or something. Right. So that's why, you know, we made the Dark Wallet. And when did you first meet Vitalik? Can you remember? Yeah, so I was, like, I said I was living in these squats around Europe. Yeah. So after 2012, then... Then there was like, okay, there was like a friend I met many, many years ago when I was hitchhiking. And he was a really cool dude. And I just saw him randomly on the internet. And I was like, bro, I'm making a conference. Come to my conference. And he's like, okay. And I didn't hear back from him. It turns out he just walked onto a ferry without any documentation. He came from Estonia across Europe. He came into England. And he was like, he now looked like Jesus. But he had like long hair and long beard and stuff. Didn't look good for an entry. Anyway, Mihai met him at the conference. It was like enchanted by him. He was like, I just met this guy, your friend. He looks like Jesus, man. And then I can't remember how it happened, but yeah. so then he he was meant to come back with me to my house actually he missed the train okay and so he ended up just walking into around the building in london and that was like the building of the occupy activists right then i went there and then mihi came and we just started living there and then we started setting up our hat club right there But then also I have friends in Spain that are hackers that also they're making these communities. They also had Calafo. So then they decided to make Calafo, which was eco-industrial. Near Barcelona, right? Yeah. So I was living with Mihai, I think, for like a year in London. Right. And then we went to Calafo in Barcelona. Right. And Mihai co-founded the Bitcoin magazine with Vitalik. Right, right. And so then I was also working on the Bitcoin magazine with them. Oh, I see. Right, right. you know not I wasn't I didn't write loads of stuff it was mainly those guys writing stuff but like for example I helped Mihai with the graphic design right like some of the covers I helped design right when we were high there you go so then anyway we went to California and then Vitalik came to live with us yeah So then it was and then there was like two other Spanish hackers, which are old friends of mine and we We were working together on projects. Yeah, so I'm right that was when we started dark wallet, right? I knew Cody from the conference So I says like Cody let's start the wallet which conference from the Amsterdam conference the one that you Right, right Was that the one that you organized? Yeah, I did the 2011 one in Prague. Right. And the 2012 one in London as well. Right, right. Yeah. So, yeah, at the time we were working together in the Hack Lab. Mihaly had his, I think it was Akasha. I'm not sure. No, I think he did that later. Oh, no, it was Agora or something. Right. Anyway, he was creating, I guess, what Darkfire is going to be now, like a social network marketplace. Okay. So then he was working on that, and my friends were working on that. And Vitalik was working on Bitcoin stuff. I was working on Bitcoin stuff. Right, right. And then he was also working, they were working on the magazine. Yeah. So we were doing a whole bunch of stuff there in Hack Lab. Yeah, right. And then, you know, we co-founded the Dark Wallet. Right. And Peter Todd as well? No, Peter Todd came later. But you can see the original Dark Wallet announcement video on YouTube. And it has all the co-founders listed. Right, right. So, yeah, we were working on that. And then, so the CIC was a network of 10,000 cooperatives throughout Catalonia. Okay. And the whole reason that was made is because there's like a big anarchist movement in Catalonia. Yeah, yeah. And they... You know, they'd been doing their thing for many years. Right. But then they started to mature as anarchists, and they were like, so to think more about economics. Right. And organization and stuff. Right. It's something I also like about this Spanish tradition of anarchists. Right. They're a lot more organized than, for example, like London, where it's just like crazy people going, you know, like. Yeah. So they... Yeah, so they were like, okay, we need to make a network of cooperatives. And cooperatives need to provide all the basic things that people need to live. And we would therefore become autonomous from the state. So we'd become our own parallel system, which is cool, cool stuff. And so our team... was actually the cryptocurrency part of that. They were interested in cryptocurrency because, for example, trading inside the network allowed people to avoid paying taxes because they consume from each other. But they also wanted to exchange outside of it. So they were like, oh, we can use cryptocurrency to do that. So we set up the first ATMs in Catalonia for cryptocurrency as part of this cooperative. but they also had a research lab which was a giant factory complex in the catalan countryside right which is um it was burnt down and the people came there with a proposal to the owner to buy it from the owner right but then also there they had like it was it's like a village basically it's massive um but they had like a industrial research sector electronics one of them was the hacking stuff which is our club right and that's where we were doing our cryptocurrency stuff right right um but anyway as part of that research of the cic and the tools that the cic needed that's how we came up we came up with these ideas which is the ones maybe you've seen the page it's on archive right on system one talking about bit law anyway i'm not sure anyway there's like a bunch of pages on our old wiki right and it's talking about like oh what the applications we need to build with bitcoin right so then um that's when vitalik started to become interested in in those ideas right right so then afterwards he left to master coin yes the bitcoin he was like okay yeah uh loosen the restrictions on the op codes yeah and the bitcoin people were like no yeah we're not changing

**opus:**

> Yeah, I was traveling a bit. I actually come from a movement of anarchist hackers in Europe, which were living in squatted buildings. Right, right. So, you know, there's like in Europe, there's all these squatters laws, which if a building is like abandoned, you can move into the building. And some squats, they last for years. Yeah. And we'd get amazing buildings. So in Amsterdam, we had a huge house. Imagine we're working on free software. We're broke devs. It's a really useful lifeline to have. And also like living in the center of the cities. I mean, like now even working in crypto, I look at the price of property and like it's ridiculous. Yeah. It's like really ridiculous. I think like societies really need that kind of stuff, like support people working on projects and software and stuff like that. It's a shame we don't. But anyway, I was part of those hacker movements, so I had, like, lots of places in Europe I could go to. You know, we would have communities, people working on free software, you know, in Barcelona, in London. London, I saw them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when did your focus switch to Dark Wallet? So actually I made the first CoinJoin and Stealth implementations in Bitcoin, which are the very first privacy techniques. So I was working on Bitcoin implementations, nodes, but I was also focused on the privacy. So I already did those projects before. Right. And then the Dark Wallet, I was like, we need to create a product. Like, we need to create, like, a wallet or something. Right. So that's why, you know, we made the Dark Wallet. And when did you first meet Vitalik? Can you remember? Yeah, so I was, like, I said I was living in these squats around Europe. Yeah. So after 2012, then there was like, okay, there was like a friend I met many, many years ago when I was hitchhiking. And he was a really cool dude. And I just saw him randomly on the internet. And I was like, bro, I'm making a conference. Come to my conference. And he's like, okay. And I didn't hear back from him. It turns out he just walked onto a ferry without any documentation. He came from Estonia across Europe. He came into England. And he was like, he now looked like Jesus. But he had like long hair and long beard and stuff. Didn't look good for an entry. Anyway, Mihai met him at the conference. It was like enchanted by him. He was like, I just met this guy, your friend. He looks like Jesus, man. And then I can't remember how it happened, but yeah, so then he was meant to come back with me to my house. Actually, he missed the train. Okay. And so he ended up just walking into around the building in London and that was like the building of the Occupy activists. Right. Then I went there and then Mihai came and we just started living there and then we started setting up our hack club right there. But then also I have friends in Spain that are hackers that also, they're making these communities. They also had Calafou. So then they decided to make Calafou, which was eco-industrial. Near Barcelona, right? Yeah. So I was living with Mihai, I think, for like a year in London. Right. And then we went to Calafou in Barcelona. Right. And Mihai co-founded the Bitcoin Magazine with Vitalik. Right, right. And so then I was also working on the Bitcoin Magazine with them. Oh, I see. Right, right. You know, not I wasn't, I didn't write loads of stuff. It was mainly those guys writing stuff but like, for example, I helped Mihai with the graphic design. Right.

So then it was, and then there was like two other Spanish hackers, which are old friends of mine and we were working together on projects. Yeah, so. Right. That was when we started Dark Wallet, right? I knew Cody from the conference. So I says like, Cody, let's start the wallet. Which conference, from the Amsterdam conference, the one that you... Right, right. Was that the one that you organized? Yeah, I did the 2011 one in Prague. Right. And the 2012 one in London as well. Right, right. Yeah. So, yeah, at the time we were working together in the Hack Lab. Mihai had his, I think it was Akasha. I'm not sure. No, I think he did that later. Oh, no, it was Agora or something. Right.

Which is, it was burnt down and the people came there with a proposal to the owner to buy it from the owner. Right. But then also there they had, like, it was, it's like a village basically. It's massive. But they had like an industrial research sector, electronics, one of them was the hacking stuff, which is our club. Right. And that's where we were doing our cryptocurrency stuff. Right, right. But anyway, as part of that research of the CIC and the tools that the CIC needed, that's how we came up, we came up with these ideas, which is the ones maybe you've seen the page, it's on archive. Right. On System D, talking about BitLaw. Anyway, I'm not sure, anyway, there's like a bunch of pages on our old wiki. Right. And it's talking about like, oh, what are the applications we need to build with Bitcoin? Right. So then Vitalik started to become interested in those ideas. Right, right. So then afterwards he left to Mastercoin. Yes, the Bitcoin, he was like, okay, yeah, loosen the restrictions on the op codes. Yeah. And the Bitcoin people were like, no. Yeah, we're not changing.

So then, yeah, Toronto in April and the crowd sale actually was like July, August-ish of 2014. And then you had the Ethereum Foundation starting to do the crowd sale. And then, yeah, early contributors got paid back for their work in those prior months. And, you know, Ethereum was often live. We did the dark market just purely for money. Right.

> No, Peter Todd came later. But you can see the original Dark Wallet announcement video on YouTube. And it has all the co-founders listed. So yeah, we were working on that. Then about and and then The so this so the CIC was a network of 10,000 cooperatives throughout Catalonia Okay, the whole reason that was made is because there's like a big anarchist movement in Catalonia. Yeah, and they You know, they'd been doing their thing for many years. Right. But then they started to mature as anarchists, and they were like, so to think more about economics. Right. And organization and stuff. Right. It's something I also like about this Spanish tradition of anarchists. Right. They're a lot more organized than, for example, like London, where it's just like crazy people going, you know, like. Yeah. So they... Yeah, so they were like, okay, we need to make a network of cooperatives. And cooperatives need to provide all the basic things that people need to live. And we would therefore become autonomous from the state. So we'd become our own parallel system, which is cool, cool stuff. And so our team... was actually the cryptocurrency part of that. They were interested in cryptocurrency because, for example, trading inside the network allowed people to avoid paying taxes because they consume from each other. But they also wanted to exchange outside of it. So they were like, oh, we can use cryptocurrency to do that. So we set up the first ATMs in Catalonia for cryptocurrency as part of this cooperative. But they also had a research lab, which was a giant factory complex in the Catalan countryside, which is, it was burnt down and the people came there with a proposal to the owner to buy it from the owner. But then also there they had like, it's like a village basically, it's massive. um but they had like a industrial research sector electronics one of them was the hacking stuff which is our club right and that's where we were doing our cryptocurrency stuff right right um but anyway as part of that research of the cic and the tools that the cic needed that's how we came up we came up with these ideas which is the ones maybe you've seen the page it's on archive right on system one talking about bit law Anyway, I'm not sure. Anyway, there's like a bunch of pages on our old wiki.
