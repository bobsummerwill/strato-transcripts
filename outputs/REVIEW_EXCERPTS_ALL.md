#### [37:20] SPEAKER_01 (block 40/53)

**Intermediate:**

> where I'm describing. Yeah. And Bob, what do you think? Do you have any of you to add on? Yeah, I mean, you know, I think a lot of it is just technical maturity as well. You know, there wasn't really any ZK back then. So it's like, how do you do privacy? How's that work? You know, and I mean, that's how Quorum like came into existence was that, you know, Amber and the team at JP Morgan wanted to do something. And without a privacy story, it was never going to get approved. They wouldn't be allowed to do anything. So it was like, okay, well, what's the thing we could do? Okay, we can have a private database and that can be offered around the side and you just do hashes on the main net and the other bits are permissioned. So it's kind of like there's a workaround for it. But, you know, they did that with open eyes, knowing like the ZK stuff is coming late, but it's not there. We have to do some hacky thing. Otherwise, we're literally not going to be allowed to do anything. I mean, this was also a story. I think that's true, too. And I'll add my take.

#### [00:00] SPEAKER_00 (block 1/276)

**Intermediate:**

> Alrighty, so we're on. Thanks. So my name is Kieran James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James from OzDR and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Blockapps which has been in operation for quite some time. But that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened and so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for, for posterity and here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion. But we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, Kieran produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes. Alrighty, so let's, let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad of bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of 14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a paypl type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. So that said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

**Intermediate:**

> Serenity. You know, they were like epochs where like there would be testing of the software and they intended to stay in testnet for quite a long time. That's the upshot. And I think they ended up like crediting some of the testnet mind ether like 1 to 10 again or 10 to 1 against real ether. So 10% of the value for the people who mined on the test. Net. So they made it kind of progressively more real. But really was fortuitous that there was that price crash because we might never have seen it. Might have never seen the light of day. So many of these.

> All righty, so we're on. Thanks. So my name is Kieran James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James Hormuzdiar and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called BlockApps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened. And so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity. And here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, current produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes. All righty. So let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad. of Bitcoin and I distinctly remember it being three dollars down from a recent peak of 14 or 15 dollars. I thought it was interesting and, you know, looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. You know, if you asked me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. With that said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

#### [1:14:22] SPEAKER_01 (block 69/136)

**Intermediate:**

> well yeah I mean the it was fun and frustrating at the same time because um I think that the Ethereum Foundation was trying pretty hard to put the specs out there but still things were changing faster than like the yellow paper could could keep up to things so I would just uh like have something to the point where it was connecting and communicating and running running the virtual machine And then like next day I'd come in and completely wouldn't work. And maybe, maybe a few weeks later, like the yellow paper would be updated to explain why. But in the meantime, the only way that I could sort of figure stuff out was to just go and get one of the other clients and read how in the world are they getting this thing to work? And there was one point when they added encryption to the connect to the connection that essentially changed the protocol completely. I connected, nothing was working anymore. I had to like just dig in and,

And at the same time they had blockchain people and the blockchain people really wanted to focus on the blockchain side of it. And the Azure people wanted to like use this as a way to, to promote, uh, the new platform. So, so there was always a little bit of friction within.

#### [33:35] SPEAKER_00 (block 31/60)

**Intermediate:**

> yeah do you remember anything about that but beyond you know it was crazy um so so there were so you had all the supply locked into this contract and I think the hack was like yeah so there was this massive race between there was a flaw in the contract logic and because it's immutable the smart contract couldn't be changed right and when people realized there was this massive race between the people who were trying to extract the money out of the contract and the people who actually worked on the Dow itself so it was like this and but the people who were successful at kind of extracting the money pulled out a lot of it like I think I I don't remember the number but I think it was like a huge amount of the value they were able to pull that out yeah now the the the ironic thing was that it got pulled out and put into an account and everyone knew where it went because you know everything on the blockchain is completely transparent but no one could do anything about it like they couldn't take the money out and so the money was just sitting there basically that got like it was like it got stolen and left on the side of the street or something and no one knew what to do about this situation

And then there was us where we were working with Microsoft that was happening sort of organically. But we realized that there was the need for companies to kind of collaborate, to work together on this kind of stuff. And Jeremy Miller just thought like this is in working like what's happening now isn't working we gotta get some you know proper structure uh because I think it was just an announcement on the ethereum Foundation site but no one was really driving it so during that day we like kind of aggregated a bunch of people in that coffee shop like it was like literally happening beside you and there was like Jeremy, you know, John Wheeling was there from Santander, like, Matt Spohr came in, I think Marley came in at one point, and, you know, Lali, James Laszlo came in, and we were all kind of saying, okay, we need this organization, we need to get this together. And it was all happening at this coffee shop that was at the Starbucks that was just like, just literally outside the conference center. And

> And I mean, another major difference there talking about clients is it was a very deliberate decision, right, on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients. And there were multiple clients from day one. I see if I can find my Twitter thread. I was finding these the other day. I was finding the first commits for PyEthereum, PyEthApp, or PyEthereum as it was, CPP Ethereum and GoEthereum. And they were all, um, I think they were all November or December. I think they were all 2013, not even 2014 for those three. Yeah. Um, and then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April, I think. But yeah, Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014. Yeah, we were much later. We were, um, when did we get deployed? Quarter 2014. Yeah. That sounds about right.

> one of my first observations on joining the the foundation is these people seem allergic to professionalism because that's seen as you know in an organized way well you're one of the baddies you know you're the status quo you're trying to subvert it and take it over you know things as simple as like like you know have we got like technical leads that actually lead know have we got any project management have we got any it have we got anything and it's like no it's just like a jumble of people doing stuff um and it's like how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment um but that was kind of the vibe as well that was seen as a good thing um you know because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing right you know we don't

> um and then you know how are those words continuing so over that month or so right where it's like you know the money's been stolen into the sub down are we going to do anything you know you have the most um you know vigorous debate on all platforms right you know it was the the topic you know what's going to happen how's it going to go and everything right so you know I don't think there's anyone that was like unaware of this stuff happening you know it's very very everyone with their eyes open Um, but yeah, you know, you just, you just have this group of people kind of gathering together and it's like, no, you know, we're not gonna go with it. This is not gonna happen. Or, or at least like, you know, we're not following that hard. Maybe people do, but you know, a bunch of people deciding not to, um, the other thing I thought was really interesting at the time and was to my mind, the, the best thing of all about that chain split is to that point, I don't think there's ever been a minority chain that survived, right? The standard thinking is like, you're going to have a winning side and a losing side. And, you know, it's going to happen and we'll see where's the thing, you know, where are the people going, which is the winner and then the losers, you know, well, you know, people will stop mining, it will just die, right? Because it's the loser chain. So there's no economic value there and, you know, forget it. But what actually happened on the ATC side is, you know, you had miners that were like, well, you know, just going to keep on mining. I'm not updating, you know. You know, some of it going, you know, the evil Ethereum Foundation and, you know, Vitalik's a dictator. You know, I mean, I don't think any of that's true. But you have got people that were like, no, I'm going to keep going. And then, oh, look, block production's still going and, you know, it's still happening there. uh and then poloniex listed it and then it's got a market value and then you've got speculative activity around that you've got ether holders like dumping their etc you know it's hey it's free money um but also you've got other people on the other side going well you know i see real value here and like this etc is going cheap so you know noticeably notably barry silbert who first non-bit in ethereum to that point presumably like based on pre-mine and various other things but was like well oh actually like you know an immutability focused dtc uh you know would be would be really interesting so yeah you just got this sort of grassroots thing forming you've got volunteers jumping up saying hey you know I'm a developer I'll keep maintaining the the classic geth clients and so on and um you know and it it found its own uh legs there you know you had like the the ethereum subreddit was like a primary communication platform at that point and then you had like an appearing classic one um you know being created and some people in you know, one side, some on the other, but you know, it, it got quite bitter in the end, right? You know, you've got a lot of people that were like, you know, foundation, you guys, you just ruined, you know, you've just ruined the project. Um, and you had people, um, on the other side, seeing is seeing ETC is really illegitimate, you know, as, as saying, well, look, you, you know, it's just a money grab. You just want your free money. Um, you know, why are these Bitcoiners kind of coming over? Like they weren't interested in Ethereum before and now they are like, that's not, you know, uh, you know, that's, that's not good. And, and you did obviously have a bunch of speculators in there as well. So that's all a bit nasty too. Um, but I think the thing that like severed those communities, um, finally was this like 100% F meme which came about because somebody tweeted, hey Vitalik, I hear that you're working on Ethereum Classic. Is there any truth to this? And he said, no, I'm only working on Ethereum. And the person then said, well, what if ETC had more market cap than Ethereum? And he said, no, I still wouldn't work on it. 100 F like he wasn't saying it in a purity pledge we was just in the way he does being just making a factual statement but then I remember you know Joe replied you know I'm 100 F and then it's like everyone's doing it right it's this purity pledge you know everyone is expected to you know pledge allegiance to air So it became a, you know, oh, shit, is this an either or? Like, you can't be in both. Like, if you're interested in ETC, then, you know, you're a dirty person. So I think that really wedged it, you know, wedged it permanently apart at that point. And also, you know, a number of the people that were volunteering on ETC, you know, they were really angry. They were like, you know, well, I, you know, been involved for, two two and a bit years in this project you know really pumped about everything that you can do with ethereum and that you guys have you know wrecked it so there was a lot of you know bitterness from that ec side back um but then you know things kind of split apart and and over time etc you know found its own path so with the real differentiation being Well, firstly, the DAO hack didn't happen. That was the only initial difference. Very rapidly, though, there was this conclusion that fixed economic policy was needed. You know, the ETC was really like Bitcoin with Ethereum technology, but, you know, Bitcoin, you know, culture and ethos. So it's like, right, you know, there's no fixed monetary policy for Ethereum. I mean, you see this over many years is like, you know, change of change of block rewards ice age delays uh fee burning you know many many changes so um that was the first kind of like major change on the etc side was introduction of that fixed monetary policy because there was consensus that that was an import you know that was like bad inheritance that we that we want to fix and the other thing that that enabled was the uh the grayscale etc fund So at that point, it's like, right, okay, this is really a Bitcoin feeling thing. And there's a feeling that there's a value here. So then from that, Grayscale then created the ETC cooperative that I work from. So a share of the fees went into that kind of not quite a foundation, but a bit like a foundation, a nonprofit to support the ecosystem. And then the other thing more recently is just proof of work. You know, there was sort of fairly rapidly a consensus that ETC wanted to stick with proof of work indefinitely, but that proof of state was seen as a, you know, as a centralising, oligarchic, kind of thing that didn't really fit with that ethos. But more generally, ETC is tracking protocol changes in Ethereum, you know, very compatible. So there have been forks, but not the hard fork along the way, because... Well, so yeah, I mean, hard forks, but not chain splits. Got it. Okay. In the all protocol updates on Ethereum as well, you know, they're all hard forks. And the old side doesn't actually go away. You could run a Frontier node if you wanted. You can mine on Frontier, mine the Olympic testnet, mine any of these ones. It's just you have had the wither and die because there hasn't been contention. But on ETC, you have sufficient contention that you had a chain split. But yeah, I guess that's sort of a Bitcoin forks are bad, but it's like, consensuous hard forks are bad. Hard forks are an upgrade mechanism for the protocol. Yeah. I mean, I remember I had to implement that fork a few years ago and it was pretty blatant. It was just like, take money from here and place it here.

> I mean, I was, I was sort of building, uh, the various clients quite a bit, cuz I was trying to integrate with them at the time. And my memory was that the C plus plus client had all the newest stuff in it first. So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there, but the go client was more stable. Like because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client, it was often an unstable situation. And so I would typically kind of go to C++ first to see the new stuff. But if it wasn't building that day, I would run over to go and try it out.

And that means they could kind of set the agenda and direction of whatever they were trying to push, if you will. It was unfortunate that it was like, Um, way back then it was that easy to sway, but I think that's something Vitalik probably learned, uh, certainly by the time we launched the project, he was becoming more aware of how people, um, would, would use him in that way. Um, but in the end it all worked out we all had the three different clients that were interoperable to your point the amount of work that had to go into the yellow paper to take everybody's discussion and put and codify it into something that was even if imperfect uh close enough for the for the clients to be developed totally siloed from each other um i i still remark that as one of the best things that was accomplished whoever's goal that was probably gabs but Famously, I think, Bitcoin defined the implementation as the spec. And from a technical perspective, Ethereum had an actual spec and that you could derive any implementation you wanted from it. And that's something that the purest technology guy inside of me really appreciates. Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's...

And I know both of you were kind of heavily involved with the foundation, which could have pushed that along harder or been sort of a legal brick and mortar host for the DAO as opposed to whatever it is and was. And we've seen a couple kind of work. It seems like the DeFi DAOs are okay, and they may be a little bit centralized in decision making and so on, but they actually seem to serve a purpose. And sometimes they're kind of like intimately involved in the protocols. I'm thinking like... the Aave DAO or the Uniswap DAO, etc. So like people have been able to achieve it on Ethereum. Right. And so like, why didn't Ethereum itself achieve it? Also, I mean, there's things that could be done that aren't like we could take stake weighted votes on things, for instance. And I think it's never really been done other than stake staking itself. And I don't know why. I think maybe later entrants sort of had to do it from a transparency perspective. But I think it's a will thing more than anything. One, it's like a really intense effort just to keep the network up and so on. And then it got really big and you didn't want to change it, kind of, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, I agree it didn't happen, and I think it could have happened, and I don't know. You know, there's definitely a gap there, and I don't really know the why. I want to also put in beforehand to Bob, we should, before we let Taylor go, talk a little bit about the Red Wedding, but I'll throw it to Bob on this question. Yeah, for sure. So, I mean, just on the, you know, on that Web3 vision, you know, that the other leg's not landing,

#### [24:37] SPEAKER_06 (block 17/67)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, well, I mean, something that I saw in those early days of Ethereum as well was a real kind of almost like allergic reaction to anything that looked like organization or hierarchy or structure. You know, just like this total flip to the opposite side, right? Everything's got to be flat and open and, you know, everything, everyone involved with everything, which is just completely impractical for actually organizing or doing anything. um yeah it's yeah it's just it's just nutty so but then it's like i realized it's like hierarchy isn't the problem being trapped in a hierarchy where it's to your detriment and you can't get out is the problem yeah you know yeah and a lot of and i think a lot of times what happens in that is smart people you know

#### [51:55] SPEAKER_06 (block 34/67)

**Intermediate:**

> the formation of the Ethereum Foundation, right? So the Red Wedding was 3rd of June 2014, where you had that, I guess, that final decision of the foundation happening versus the for profit because you had uh we had people coming notably answer media oreo coming to uh zoob at that point to sign papers right you know it was it was to do with that swiss uh legal entity and then it was like yep no we're not signing the papers the big mess uh and then the foundation uh, was, was July that that was, uh, incorporated and you still have the crowd sale ongoing through July and August. So yeah. And that's a hell of a long span of time. Yeah. We kept saying two weeks. I don't know. That was a meme for a very long time. Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. Well, the website that was up at the time of the Miami conference was showing a countdown to the first of February. That was when the sales were going to start. Yeah. And then, you know, I was with Vitalik when the sale was launched.

**gemini:**

#### [1:10:57] SPEAKER_03 (block 51/67)

**Intermediate:**

> if if you look at the early days and and you take all that political seriously and you realize that metallic's basically like a 18 year old kid in the middle of this like i was under prepared for the political but i wasn't even like the center of it you know metallic had to be pushed into this weird situation where all these sharks and snakes were around and where charles is acting some type of way. Um, and then everyone else around him is, is vying for power and that's a lot of stress. Right. And so if I was thinking of it from Vitalik's perspective, to me, my primary goal for myself would be to insulate myself from the, those political games to, to the greatest degree possible. Right. And so, you know, In some ways, it's kind of like the requirement to stay sane and the requirement to insulate yourself from people playing these games and trying to get to you is that you kind of have to anoint yourself king and do the thing that Charles did, which is surround yourself with people who are going to basically have like fealty to you, right? They're not there because they're trying to manipulate you or get one over on you. They're not there because they're not playing games behind your back that you're going to have to deal with. And I think that if you're trying to focus on your goal in this kind of foundational structure, I just assume that every decision that's been made in the structure of the foundation is... Michael Morehead, Based on kind of two principles, one is kind of the the amorphous notion that, like a decentralized project shouldn't have. Michael Morehead, centralized control structure and it, you know there's really some sort of kind of suicide urge that I see in the way that they structure it like it could be an organization that exists for you know. a thousand years if they organize it correctly but they're they're trying as hard as they can it seems to make it disappear and i think that that's like incredibly misguided i don't think there's any historical um examples of anything like that happening and i think that if the foundation disappeared tomorrow then all those power game you know the power vacuum would just create fucking infinity of those power games until somebody stepped up and know ethereum becomes whatever the person who can kind of get that power position so so i think that unfortunately from from my assessment vitalik's need to keep himself sane and protected um is has not been done in such a way that that the ethereum foundation necessarily serves um the long-term uh survival of ethereum uh just like that's a major concern for me. So I don't, I don't, I think a lot of people might criticize the way it's structured for reasons like, but I understand, man, like I'm not Vitalik and I've had to deal with, you know, those power games and they drive you crazy, man. They get in your way. They keep you from being able to focus on what you want to focus on. And I think not coming up through the traditional, um, kind of like Silicon Valley group. When you come up in that, you're surrounded by people who've been in it and have survived for a long time. And they understand how to support founders and they understand how to legally orchestrate these things. And I just don't think that he had those people around him to protect him. So I don't know. Kieran, you got something to say?

He just showed up and kind of inserted himself and was like, I'm going to be CEO. He's just a fucking liar, though, man. He was like 24 or something. 25. Yeah, he presented himself like he was 50 years old and he'd been in tech forever. And here's the thing, man. I actually was probably the most experienced in terms of I'd lived in Silicon Valley. I'd worked in multiple startups. But... Like despite my personality on Twitter or even if you meet me in person, like I'm pretty humble when I get into a group of people that I can tell have skills. So I kind of just sat back and didn't try to insert myself. I didn't try to like demand anything. you know i'd be involved in this or that i just tried to kind of be as helpful as i could um so you know when i when i talked to uh uh charles for the first time i was like all right you know this dude's kind of weird like but well we'll see what's up so like literally the moment i met him in miami i shook his hand and i was like oh god he's a sociopath like okay well maybe he's our sociopath you know like every company has a sociopath like maybe he's like a well-regulated sociopath and then when we got to the miami house i found out no no he's not a well-regulated sociopath he's a fucking compulsive liar manipulative weirdo kieran were you gonna say something

You know, I just remember like shooting shit with them and talking to him about thoughts and stuff. And he was real like quiet and, you know, told me about his time making music videos in Jamaica or whatever.

So Christoph and I, our paths crossed for the first time way back. back in 2015 when I was trying to do C++ Ethereum on my smartwatch. And this was around the time that Christoph was still at the Ethereum Foundation. And then I think I crossed paths across a number of times since, and Kieran's too. Indeed.

And I did find on our slack um you know a bit of a thread where where things I think from you Christoph were were being discussed by Jim I don't know did you guys interact directly at all on on testing Jim Christoph not directly not as far as I can remember I mean maybe there was some messages I mean it's about it has been a while ago

#### [38:13] SPEAKER_01 (block 40/79)

**Intermediate:**

> The problem with this is you only need it if you really need it. Meaning if Uniswap failed, the interface is not there. It's like a backup. But it's not what you want to use daily. And if you remember, maybe, Kiri, you were there at DEF CON 1. When they presented MetaMask, my first thought was oh this is totally away from the vision like how can you not run a full node how can you dare you like to just serve over rpc with infura like almost not a scam but it was like not what we intended to build today it's like this is a decentralized version of it this is like non-castor the metamask or the good guys compared to all the others. See how the view shifted over the years. Back then, it was absolutely required to run a full node if they missed browser. This is how it's done. And now we have MetaMask plus Infora. And today, this is really the version which is viewed as the original non-custodial Ethereum vision. how things are shifting, basically. But yes, you only need those things if things are falling apart. Just as an example, so many people use the Gnosis Safe. Let's say the Gnosis Safe UI is gone. Technically, it shouldn't be a problem to run another one, but there really needs to be something on IPFS, there needs to be something which can self-host, so I can still access my wallet without going to the command line. So for those reasons, you need it. And the mispronouncement was sort of as the fallback for every debt. Like, of course, you can have your application run on a normal.com domain on AWS, fine. But if you could serve the same app in a decentralized fashion as a backup, this would be great because you could still use it if the company gets a Uniswap, the company fails. If someone builds a nice Uniswap UI served by IPFS, directly interacting with the smart contracts.

And at that time, it was not like today, like a business tool for the company. It was really communities. Like we had 5,000 people in our Slack, which is not how it's used today.

And I don't know anyone that uses internet computer, but like every once in a while I see tweets about it and I'm like, that sounds great. Yeah, start the app from the chain. You know, it's got some cool like smart contracting language in it.

So, yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now. I think we did meet in Bogota for DevCon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself. I was not aware of your background and role, but... But yeah, specifically, you were an intern at Dev in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended DEFCON 1. So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time? Oh, yeah. Thank you for the intro. And good question. It was in Bogota. I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then. But yeah, I think...

**Intermediate:**

> you were chatting with someone and talking about the old days and I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum. And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client back starting September or August 2015. I think it was like... Maybe August to December? Yeah, it was August to December. It was a couple of weeks after Mainnet launched and the first week I was there was when there was like the first a big fork where the Go client forked from the C++ and Python client. There was a chain split on mainnet? Yes. And it happened, I think, the second day I was there. And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office. right um so everything was extremely chaotic and people arrived at the office for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time and eventually i was just sitting there in the corner working and i was like no we can't do this because there's so many people who are just like looking some started leaving so i i kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation of on ethereum back then that i had given a couple weeks before back in in copenhagen prior to your internship Yeah, I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group. Oh, goodness. So when do you think that started? I know exactly when it started. It started on the 14th of July 2015. Right, right. And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science. Okay. And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin. Okay. So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate? No, it was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015. I see. So you had graduated. Yeah, but just a bachelor. Right. And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then. Right, right. I... We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship. I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to the C++ client or something like that. I've known of Ethereum since the end of 2014. We wrote this bachelor thesis, me and two of my... my friends, and we shared it with the foundation, and then we got offered internships. Right, right. And I was the only one, I was tired of studying already, only after a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue, so I was like, okay, I'm going to do this. And a couple of weeks later, I moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client. Right, right. And, yeah, that was a very... interesting time like thinking back now i'm sad i didn't write down more things or right to take more pictures or appreciate some of the the things a little bit more but i also had no idea that things would get as big as they as they are now yeah but yeah i enjoyed it a lot um so i mean it was primarily c++ development under gav that was that was happening in that office right but But also Felix Lang I know was there on the Geth team. Yeah, there were some different people. I remember Gustav Simonsen, I think he was doing Go stuff. And yeah, the Solidity team was also there. I think they were under the C++ team back then, but they were there. And Remix as well. Well, Mix, sorry, at the time. Yeah. And I also remember the Mist, I guess. At least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around. So there was a good amount of different people around. And also quite often people would come and visit from other places. I remember a couple of times Christoph Jens came to visit. There was one time where... I think he arrived at midnight or something like that. And there was no one else at the office. I was doing my internship, and I think he wrote late afternoon, he wrote on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever. So I was just like, oh, it's fine. I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway. I had the smallest room. Just like a small room with a bed, nothing else basically. So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office and I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice. Right, right. Yeah, I had one night where I think I let him into the office at midnight and we had a little bit of a chat. I got to know him. He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing. It was quite interesting. And that's cross-client testing as well, wasn't it? Yeah, if I remember correctly, he was building a lot of JSON data that they fed to the clients. And that was from the C++ client, I know, that CPP Ethereum was leading And the tests were generated from that, but then running those against the Python and Geth clients. Yeah, that sounds about right. There are a lot of small stories. You told me we don't have too much time. I'll try to keep it short. I would say if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was like... Of course, being lucky enough to participate at DEFCON 1. Right, yeah. And also experience the

**Intermediate:**

> usage of money, but also the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly. Yeah, that's right. And the Ether price itself was also, I think it dipped below the pre-sale price at some point in September 2015. A year in and you've had no accumulation. But yeah, I didn't have any interactions with Ming back then. Actually, one thing I just remembered now, I was actually supposed to have done my internship on the C++ team in London, but a couple of weeks before that, I was told, sorry, we can't do it anyway because we don't have the money anymore. Right. Well, because they were getting very rapidly the funding or even shut down entirely, I think. Yeah, probably already. Or that was coming. Yeah, so that's why it ended up being the Python team instead because there was some budget. But yeah, like sitting as the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner, I had a lot of fun kind of following how people came and went and went into Gavin's office and had a chat there with him in Utah or whatever. And I didn't really know in the beginning what was going on until I was also asked if I wanted to come in and talk. And it was basically like, presenting ideas of what would happen next with the C++ team and if they wanted to consider joining there or whatever. So that was sort of the pre-formation of what became F-Core, later Parity. Yeah, I think so. I was witnessing that without knowing what was going on. I had no insight into the finances of the foundation or anything like that. I only found out about most of those things later. But it was quite interesting to see. Yeah, so maybe let's talk about DevCon 1. So the first DevCon was DevCon 0.

> which happened in November 2014, before your time, which was the closed event. Mainly Ethereum Foundation-y people, but some broader ecosystem people. But then DEVCON1 happened in November 2015 in London. it had got announced early in the year and got cancelled because of this funding squeeze but then consensus basically stepped up and filled that funding gap and and did some organizing so that was in november of that year i i was not present myself that i i couldn't afford to go or whatever at the time but i watched a lot of the limestream but You know, that was a really very seminal conference. So how was that? For me, it was amazing.

#### [10:38] SPEAKER_00 (block 6/6)

**Intermediate:**

> I've never been good at sitting still on a chair for a long period of time. But there I was at every talk from the beginning in the morning until the end. I think I missed one talk because I had to go catch my flight to go back on the last day. But I was just sitting there and sucking up all of these ideas and visions. And it was really... I think before that I had an idea that I thought it would be interesting to continue working with Ethereum or in the Ethereum space. But after DEFCON 1, I was like, I have to do this. There's no other way for me. I'm not going back to the university. I'm not going to do anything else. This is what I'm going to do. Because it was a full day, or three full days, of just sitting there and people presenting their ideas. I remember clearly Maker was presented. I was like, okay, we can do stablecoins. I was like... amazing. I think Fabian Vogelsteller and Alex Vanassande and some other people presented the ERC20 token standard or the early version of it, which, yeah, OK, this has also this is such a big part of Ethereum now. think maybe Gnosis I'm not sure actually and of course the project I was working on the people there like we were presenting the Raiden network which got a lot of very good feedback as well so it was it was so interesting and Hydrochain as well right yeah I was not so sold on Hydrochain back then because it was like aimed at yeah One of the very first permissioned Ethereum. Exactly. It was like a round-robin kind of algorithm. And now it seems like something people would actually have used these days. So only 10 years too early. But back to DEFCON 1, I was just thinking about it after our conversation last night, that DEFCON 1, It was just about the technology. I think maybe there were three booths or something like that. They just had a couple of stickers. I barely remember. I just remember what was the name of the Haskell project? Block App Strato. I remember they had a small booth, I think, and some stickers. I'm very sad that I lost that sticker. But other than that, it was just people. There was one stage and everyone was in the same room. And in the evenings, people would go out for dinner maybe, but there was not a single side event. There was not a single party. Glory days. It was just dinners and a couple of shepherd's pies somewhere. Right. And that was kind of fun. You got to know people really, really well. And it was really just the golden days, I felt like. There were so many inspired people and ideas, and people only talked about tech. I think there was like one... a little bit weird product hype talk with a guy who had a t-shirt gun on the stage this like free my bunk right like a very different energy than everybody else it felt like he was the only one who actually knew how to give a talk and how to actually sell and back yeah i thought it was way too much but now now it's basically what everyone else is doing and the quality of slides was so bad as well it's right to look back But yeah, I was thinking about that and then I was comparing with, let's say, DEF CON 2. Right. I think at DEF CON 2 there was maybe like A couple of parties, I think ConsenSys had a bar somewhere where we would usually go. It was still not that big. There was still only one stage, I think, at DEFCON 2. There was just one main stage. Yeah, quite doable. And then I think at DEFCON 3 in Cancun, that was where you could really feel, okay, now there's a lot of money in this space because there were parties right and left. And yeah, the rest is history, right? That's right. It's been quite crazy to see this development as well. measuring on the amount of events and parties at the different DEF CONs, how popular things got. But for me, the DEF CON one is like, one of my best memories of these 10 years, simply because it was just so inspiring and motivating, I would say. And a lot of the people you have on your list were around there. It's quite cool. And I actually recently found out that someone I got to know or a couple of years ago only, who's also doing some cool stuff. He actually was around there. We didn't meet each other. I only found out like two years ago. And he said he didn't see almost any talks because he was sitting in the back trying to get or the guest client to run on his machine or something like that because it was not easy back then. It took days. Even if you had the devs available right next to you, it wasn't easy. So yeah, I think that's mainly what I have to share without going into too much detail about things. Well, thanks so much. You're very welcome. Great chatting always. Yeah. Okay. All the very best. Thank you. You too.

And that was sort of like how the beginning of that of people getting together to start doing that happened. So I have like another sort of like interconnection that the first time I ever spent Bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought whiskey for Smari McCarthy and Asta Fish, who were two of the parliamentarians in Iceland from the Pirate Party. Oh, yeah, yeah. And Smari McCarthy, you know, was one of the early WikiLeaks guys, right? Okay. And they were sitting in Jörg Platzer's bar in Berlin, room 77, which is where the earliest Bitcoin meetups were happening. Okay, okay. And also was the first place that you could buy alcohol with crypto with Bitcoin yeah and so smari had uh tweeted that he was going going to york's bar and i was like okay cool i've definitely got to buy you a whiskey so like we did this over twitter and i and i you know i published the tr the transaction you know on twitter right right to see that it was confirmed and i you know bought them whiskey in your bar and And so Jörg Platzer is one of the original members here of Parallel Only Polis, right? Oh, yeah. Right, okay. So the role that I have here now of kind of being the one that packs it all together and gives like a vibe of, you know, where we're at in the space or where we're at in the house was what Jörg used to do here. And so, yeah, there's like an interesting connection. And so Room 77... Yeah, is actually where it is that Vitalik and Gavin decided to literally to actually do a theory. Right. Right. Gavin was introduced to Vitalik by Amir. Yes. Who's also here in the house. And so like this house is really like interconnected for me with all of these people. This social nexus. Yeah, yeah. Because Michael Goolsky who was my partner in Bitcoin is Without Borders, who was the PHP programmer who wrote the module for all of the membership donations to the Bitcoin Foundation, was an original member of this house. And he's the one who introduced me to Amir Taki. Right. And also the one who introduced me to Lynn Ulbricht. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. And he's the guy that started freeross.org. Right, right. So we're really far away from Ethereum history, but it's kind of... Yeah, yeah. To talk about Ethereum in the early days, you have to talk about Bitcoin. Right. Because, you know, it was an ICO on... Right, right. It was an ICO on Bitcoin, right? And you were... not so far away from Berlin all of these years. I mean, did you meet some of these people in Berlin? Was that primarily where? These people were coming through Vienna as well. So we had two spaces in Vienna. We have Metalab, which is the second earliest hackerspace after CCC in Europe. So there was Noisebridge. in San Francisco and CCC and Metalab. So that's where early meetups happened in Bitcoin. But the earliest Ethereum meetups were at Riot, R-I-A-T dot A-T from Matthias Tarsiewicz and Ralph. And they hosted the first Ethereum meetups, which is the first time that I met Vitalik personally. Was that Riot? Right. There you go. Yeah. But yeah, you'd mentioned the yellow paper. So the timeline on that is...

> So I had two viewpoints I think that are common to early Bitcoiners, right? Anything that can be built on another chain can eventually be deployed on Bitcoin, right? Yep. Very common early belief.

I'm really happy that all this stuff is happening on Ethereum. like a sandbox. Right. Yeah. And not happening on Bitcoin. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So so I mean, look at the look at the ecosystem. You know, I think one of the coolest things that that Ethereum enabled was was crowdfunding. Right. Yeah. Just this completely alternative economy that created stocks, shareholders, you know what I mean? And it's in a completely new form that just was so direct. Yes. Right. Yeah. It's like amazing. The whole world should literally work like that. And I so I love that aspect of a theorem is that they is that they just fucking did it. Yeah. That literally we issued created companies, created, oh, There's no jurisdiction where we can register and do our stuff. Fuck it. We're going to build DAOs. You know what I mean? And so all of this fabulous permissionless stuff has happened on Ethereum that could not culturally happen on Bitcoin and may not ever actually happen on Bitcoin. yeah with the way that it's becoming part of the traditional finance yeah yeah so another thing that i think is really interesting is seeing the is seeing what's going on now with actually enterprise ethereum and you were at the ea at the beginning which was super logical for me right yeah but it was too early because there wasn't really any clients you were just doing educational work pilots

I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one is pretty cool. Pretty great. Because you're thinking, there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Isn't there just an answer that just works? But the thing is, those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind. They don't like it. They want to track you in. Yeah, exactly. X especially. So that's against our vision. On X, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah, it's... Why would you want to download it? You know, like that's something, you know, I guess the next step in maybe like... You want to use it somewhere else? Are you seeing somebody else? Be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms. Even own a query or just access, you know. Something I love about Google is like I can go, I can activate, you know, like the tracking, you know. But at least I can go in and say, what did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have like thousands of data, but they don't even share it with you. Yeah, exactly. I find it quite, quite well.

I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one is pretty cool. Pretty great. Because you're thinking, there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Isn't there just an answer that just works? But the thing is, those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind. They don't like it. They want to track you in. Yeah, exactly. X especially. So that's against our vision. On X, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah, it's... Why would you want to download it? That's something, the next step in maybe like... You want to use it somewhere else? Are you seeing somebody else? Be able to own your data in all those platforms. Even own a query or just access. Something I love about Google is like I can go, I can activate the tracking. But at least I can go in and say, what did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have like thousands of data, but they don't even share it with you. Yeah, exactly. I find it quite, quite well.

So let's say I've got some USD, I want some Euro. And we kind of like agree to a USD Euro trade. And so we like, I guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at. And I think it's like, I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to Swift. And you do too. And then Swift checks if it matches. It charges $7 either way. If it does match, then it'll tell us that it matched. Well, I don't think it's actually exactly this way.

Um, so like when I was learning UX UI, it was, I, it was like some courses that I would take and do that. And then a lot of it was just trial and error. And I think a big part of it was having my own thing and I'm sure Kieran can I think all of you, both you guys can relate to this, is that once it's yours, there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it rather than just working for someone. When you work for someone, it's like, oh, okay, I get equity options and this and a paycheck, and that's nice. That's not as much skin in the game as truly... owning something and having being like aligned of like okay if i kill this like i get monetarily incentivized just because i killed it and it's my baby right um so i think that sort of shines a lot in in in being like a founder and growing your own application and then it's just like i have like an obsession with it to be honest like i have an obsession of talking to users and understand what makes it better. And just like the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth it over. Right. And so I think all of that has just like aggregated to and led me to where I am today.

You don't have to worry about even having your phone stolen, right? Like we can recover everything in, programmatic ways and secure ways as well. That's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. And so, but at least the next wave of updates that we're gonna be doing is gonna be really cool too. I think like, it's just like the ability to, essentially the alpha is like the ability to send bank transfers from an on-chain account, like to specific accounts all over the world for very, very cheap. Um, so like stuff like that is going to be really cool because that solves real pain, right? It's like this idea of going back to before literally what I've been talking about, um, like crypto and even to tie it all in for the is better web three UX, the key to mainstream adoption. And I don't think it is right. It's like better UX is the key to any app adoption, right? It's why we've seen Robin hood or whatever get big, but there needs to be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day. And if our ability, if my ability to send an on-chain transaction, and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or a spay transfer from the US to Mexico for only a dollar, like that's significant pain being solved because like most common applications right now that do it are let's say like Dollar App or Felix, and they do it for like a $3 flat fee, which is still pretty expensive for considering if you want to send money to someone, if you only wanna send it in small amounts, right? a hundred dollars that's a three percent fee that's quite high and so we can basically do it in a way with like no limits no caps you can send fifty thousand dollars for for a dollar if you want to do it like with banking rails or if you want to just keep it on chain and keep it in pistachio right it's it's free unlimited as we all know how you can like send money and in in crypto land right you can send a million dollars in a second for for only a few cents and on pistachio every all the peer to peer transactions are free so i think we're ready for normies right now but it's just about increasing the amount of um increasing the use cases within the app to solve very distinct pains. Painful, expensive pains. That's the way to do it. Okay. Well, thank you very much. Thank you guys for having me. Yeah. I know you got to run. At least some of us will be at some of the international events. Maybe we can catch up there. Yeah, perfect. Please, if you guys are going to eat for that time in Brazil or DevConnect, I'll be at both of them. We will definitely be there. Look forward to seeing you in person, man. And I want to see your talk. Share us details about your talk, man. Yeah, absolutely. Will do. Take care. Okay. Thanks so much. Thanks. It was great to meet you, Bob. You too. Cheers. Bye-bye.

A hundred dollars that's a three percent fee that's quite high and so we can basically do it in a way with like no limits no caps you can send fifty thousand dollars for for a dollar if you want to do it like with banking rails or if you want to just keep it on chain and keep it in Pistachio right it's free unlimited as we all know how you can like send money in crypto land right you can send a million dollars in a second for only a few cents and on Pistachio every all the peer to peer transactions are free so I think we're ready for normies right now but it's just about increasing the amount of, increasing the use cases within the app to solve very distinct pains. Painful, expensive pains. That's the way to do it. Okay. Well, thank you very much. Thank you guys for having me. Yeah. I know you got to run. At least some of us will be at some of the international events. Maybe we can catch up there. Yeah, perfect. Please, if you guys are going to ETHDenver or DevConnect, I'll be at both of them. We will definitely be there. Look forward to seeing you in person, man. And I want to see your talk. Share us details about your talk, man. Yeah, absolutely. Will do. Take care. Okay. Thanks so much. Thanks. It was great to meet you, Bob. You too. Cheers. Bye-bye.

You can definitely push the price as reported and provided by the decks off of the true market price. And in here we're combining a couple different data sources to get the spot price and that's just coming through an Oracle really here it's just a reminder. The spot price is used for like the health calculations when you borrow and the reason you want to do that is you know someone could do a big trade on the one of the pools and manipulate that price and then liquidate someone or or etc as we.

That's right. So basically the deal there was that I guess annually you had like the king giving the speech in front of the parliament, you know, So you had like basically the royalty and all of the elite sitting in the hall. They like stuffing barrels of gunpowder underneath, but it was discovered at the last minute. So then there you go. You now have a burning of Guy Fawkes in effigy on bonfire nights to celebrate that it didn't happen. And yeah, so you have a doll or whatever that's the guy that you put on the fire. So anyway, happy bonfire night, everybody. Happy bonfire night. We should probably introduce Michael, because he's a special guest. Absolutely, yes. I guess he's a guest. We'll make him a regular, I assume. You guys see me on the telegram. Michael, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

That's represented of my, my lending pool contribution. I believe that is in these non earnings right here. I am a good, so let's also contribute some money to the swap pool so you can earn APY. Let's see what looks juicy right now. The silver wow. Silver trains. Looking for my deposit. And we are deposited and we're earning APY.

Victor, who's with us here, is the chief Product officer and co founder. Mercator V2 is the new iteration of our application of our network, which has been a major focus for us this year, we spent the vast majority of this year rebuilding a completely new application experience. The current production mainnet is more of a ebayish kind of setup really coming out of an earlier period where we were having a marketplace of kind of like collectibles, tokenized whiskey barrels and other things which were more NFT like. The focus for V2 is really about high quality hard assets, specifically gold and silver.

#### [14:08] SPEAKER_03 (block 35/138)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, I mean, early on I was like part of what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where the users of the networks also participate in upside of the network. There's. The fat protocol article. That was super popular 2016. So just thinking about, okay, what does monetization look like and can you build platforms that are. More collaborative than extractive, where it's like if you're meta, you're just like, I'm just going to extract as much metadata and sell ads, which is a great business. But partially for me it was almost like a thought experiment of is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads? And it could be, maybe it's a marketplace as the business model and then it's like collective ownership via the token. So yeah, I was, you know, drink drinking a lot of the crypto Kool Aid at the time. Still am, yeah. To be, yeah.

#### [24:27] SPEAKER_01 (block 70/138)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, please take a take on it. So in defy, we're starting to see like as the administration has cleared the way to some extent, it seems like there was a pent up demand for something like a TRADFI defi merger. It's not all the way there yet, but it's getting to just be fi. Like I see the path to that happening. Do you think NFTs really stay sort of like a distinct asset class forever? I know maybe you could talk about your gallery. I know you started to do a lot of physical sales.

#### [09:30] SPEAKER_01 (block 11/41)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, I, well, I mean, it was super interesting, right? You know, like we were all kind of on the ground floor at the consensus office or like, you know, at least me and Kieran are hanging out there and like watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating. Cause I was like, I remember me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC 20 tokens and like, I found it was like super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard is a super simple protocol, very simple code. But like the adoption created this, you know, there's massive wealth generation. And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans in the economy. Like it was like incredible to see that happen. And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC721 and I saw the CryptoPunks launch and I was like, well, this is pretty crazy. If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata. It could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs and that I don't know exactly what the business model is going to look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large. So that got me into NFTs. And then on the flip side of that, I was also kind of in and around the New York art scene, like going to the art fairs. I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kind of part of the business of art. And it's just seemed obvious. I was like, oh, there's now a way to kind of like truly own digital assets. And this is obviously going to apply to digital art. So it's kind of like the marriage of, you know, like my interest in the tech side, but then also my interests and passions around art.

It's just enormous stuff sitting five years, 10 years, you know, and it's feast or famine. Like if we print a bunch of money, probably get a bunch of transactions. Yeah. Just wait. Yeah.

> technically worked, but were a business failure, I think is fair to say. And so, you know, the audience can learn from our like sort of failed mistakes in the past right now. But we sort of built, so we had heard years ago about CK, but we sort of just, I don't know, at the time looked into it and said like, oh, this looks like overly complicated. You can get privacy through these other means. And we ended up building a system that that allowed for sort of like quick spin up of private chains that everything was sort of like in an encrypted tunnel and you could have like these chains completely secure and nobody else would see what was happening there. But long story short, you know, slow learning process. We found out that customers want everything and to the point that it made it worthless. Like we would go into enterprise, we would say like, oh, you can set up these private channels with others. And they loved that because they could sort of control that and they could control who goes in there. But then once everything was going through these private channels, then they wanted to be able to like transfer from private chain to private chain. And that's where everything started to fall apart. And getting things back onto the main chain became sort of this extra complicated system. And at the same time customers wanted to have like a full flexibility in having like extensions to solidity where you could just like name a chain and send some money from chain A to chain B. And really the only way to make that stuff work is you have to go back to ZK. So ZK is overly complicated, but it is necessary. And so, We started looking at that again, but I think like the safe thing to do is start with a proven technology and Zcash had been around for years and nobody had stolen money. And this is just sort of like a subset of ZK, but it's kind of a cool thing. You can build what they call tumblers of money. You throw a bunch of money in and then the money that you put into the Tumblr is, you know how much went in, but the ownership is completely scrambled up. And at any time you can go and transfer money from within the Tumblr from one user to another, but only the users who did the transferring and got the money know what was there, but nobody else can see what's happening. So again, like you have these systems of multiple users with lots of money, but you don't know who owns a percentage of the money.

#### [19:56] SPEAKER_00 (block 15/29)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, Bob, you were saying something? Yeah, so Zcash is onto its fourth round of different cryptography. So I forget what they're called, Sapling, something else. We're onto Orchard now. But I mean, that's been now over the course of nearly a decade. You know, each time you've got another sort of two years worth of leading edge advancement. And... And yeah, like talking about that performance thing. So something which I think has been a key piece in Zcash price appreciation recently has been the arrival of a functional mobile wallet. So that's called Zashi, which is made by the... electric coin company, but you're basically at the point where you can run that proof on your phone. So something which used to be laptop seven minutes is now phone second. So what you've seen, if you look at the size of these shielding pools, where these pools are effectively like, you know, all of these things are all you know, mixed and hidden together, right? The more that you've got in a pool, the more, you know, the more unlinkable you are. If you have a, you know, if you do something simple like ring signatures where you're just whatever, I think Monero's got 16 transactions that, you know, get all joined together. So you can trace through that to a degree, but if you've got hundreds or thousands or millions of people in that same pool, it's effectively completely anonymous at that point. But if you look at the stats of usage of these particular pools, are you seeing what proportion of the money supply has been shielded versus being transparent? I guess that's another thing to say, right? Bitcoin is transparent, so same with Ethereum. But then they use the word shielded to talk about that you are within this anonymity set. So these earlier rounds, you had a bit of use, but not a ton of use. But right now, I can't find the view, but it was something like about four or five million of the 21 million were within that shielding pool. So a significant chunk of it is shielded now, which was never the case in the past. I remember on ETC at some point, we were looking at whether we were going to bring over the pre-compiles to do with some of the curves. I don't know if you remember that happened in Ethereum at some point, but one of the Blake curves, I think, went into the pre-compile. And we were talking about whether we were going to do that or not. And really talking about gas limit as well. How gas expensive would operations be using these things even? And the stats at that time were, you know, it's like maybe 2% of transactions on Zcash were shielded, something like that. You know, it's basically like not being used at all, you know, functionally pretty much identical to Bitcoin. But probably a lot of end users going, yeah, I'm using Zcash, I'm private. And it's like, yeah, you know, you're not at all. You're getting zero benefit at all.

#### [18:08] SPEAKER_03 (block 34/66)

**Intermediate:**

> Yes, but what's the whole acronym? There is a way, I think, to take an arbitrary computation and to prove that it has a certain result without revealing the intermediate states and so on, but it's not computationally feasible. It's just so slow that if you try to do it that way, it becomes very difficult. So I believe, just tying back to Jim's point, you could try to do this in a generality, like the EVM. I can verify there are these ZK EVMs. I can verify any computation that comes out of this thing. And I think the problem with them has been performance. And so the Zcash people, I guess, had to decompose every little step into specific circuits, right? Yeah. very low-level programming thinking in the ZK world. Literally, they're circuits that you end up compiling and so on and so forth.

You got to continue to push that down, but I think the ratio is very large. Well, I think we are at time. You know, where can we find you, Jim? I'm going to start with you. Where can you find me? Yes. People want to hear more and learn more about Jim, which I, you know, please speak up, ask him where can, where they find you.

> pouring more money into it from the seams of it. At a time, I think much of the space was extremely eager for institutional approval, even with some nominal hostility to it. And I now feel the emotion that I'm like, I almost don't want it. I'm like, get out of here. I want it to go back. I guess I'm happy maybe about the asset values, although it's not my primary motivation at all. But I hope that they don't, because the thing you see with like, you know, the Web2 world, while the internet remains at least kind of open, the people use like six apps. And so it's just pretty easy to affect the whole planet of users of the internet just through these six apps. And I kind of... It could easily happen that way in crypto, where crypto itself remains totally open. But like, as a for instance, so the company, we have a Coinbase account, which we use a little bit, and they are way more difficult and onerous and making information requests all the time than any bank I've dealt with. It's bizarre. They try to introduce a whitelist for the accounts you could send out to. This was like a month ago. Apparently you could turn this feature off and it's for your protection in case someone's gotten in there. But it's like you're worse than the thing you said that you were setting out to destroy from a is-it-our-money perspective. And that feels... You know, I'm happy that the Genius Act passed, I think, but it also has that feel, too. Coinbase itself is now in, like, a fight with the banks. Like, wait, wait, wait, we didn't mean you could do this. We want an all-yield band. So...

> I wonder if that's changed. It used to be like the joke that I've both experienced in my face to face life and like on crypto Twitter. It's like when you're like dentist or realtor friend asks you about what you think about Cardano or Ripple, then it's time to sell. There was plenty of Charles, but no Ripple. Yeah, I wonder. I think BNB flipped XRP recently. They did. I just saw that. Yeah, up to number three. Amazing. How are you guys feeling about having been in the space for so long that long-term projects like MetaMask are now launching a token? Oh, yeah, yeah. This is another part of the crazy. This is a good reminder. I think basically just a lot was held back by uncertainty. And so the high-quality stuff A strange thing about the Gensler era was that it felt like at least the eye of Sauron was on the good projects and the bad projects, in a sense, were sort of left to run and the good ones. So like any industry, if you looked at all of the businesses, Most of them are bad. Most of them go out of business. And if you imagine if you like made all the businesses publicly traded, most of the stocks would go to zero. So you would kind of expect in crypto that like most tokens are bad. It's sort of like what you would see if you just made essentially no barriers to entry to like publicly listing stock, not that tokens are stock, but anyway. So, however, if you kind of market cap weighted, you would probably find that the things near the top are pretty high quality. And then sometimes things will come out of the bottom and go into the top. But by and large, you should sort of forget about that long tail of things. And it did feel like, to a significant degree, the eye was on the big things. And it tried to destroy them before there was a token or freeze them or what have you. it left the bad stuff to run amok, contributing to the impression that the space was just all scams. And it might be all scams by number of projects. The average project might be a scam or just not worth any value. But the average business is not a good business. But the big ones are good most of the time, not all of them. And they're kind of just being allowed out.

**Intermediate:**

> Um, and that really changes things. Yeah. And, um, one question, uh, like, are we going to DevConnect? I know me and Bob have already bought our tickets. Karen, you're the hoedown. Can I get a commitment? I'm still a problem. Let me, um, I want, I've never been to Argentina. I really do want to go. Um, but. I really want to see what's going on. Yeah, I haven't been to South America, and I really want to see what's happening in the crypto world over there. Because you hear a lot about it. Obviously, there are big exchanges and big projects there. So I'm just really curious to find out. Vitalik said he's more likely to get recognized in Buenos Aires than in the US, say. Yeah. Well, and so if you like this content, please join us every week. We have this at the same time. Follow us on Twitter at straddlemercada with an A and join our Telegram community. Bob, if they want to hear more from you, where can they find you? Yeah, so I'm just Bob Simerill, same as my name, on Twitter. And Kieran, where can people find you? um k james lubin um so shortened but but my name also um on on twitter slash x and you can find me at vic for wong on twitter um bob and karen have both shamed me publicly because i have so few followers even though i was an early adopter so please please uh connect to me love to hear from you what what's the fall about what what's the vic for what's what's that so Four is a number that no Chinese person likes because it sounds suspiciously like death. So back in the world of eight-character usernames, I could always get Vic4Wong because having an Asian name with the number four in it pretty much guaranteed that I could get it. Always doing things the Wong way. Yeah. Exactly. I've never heard that joke before. Okay. Thank you, everyone. See you again next week. Take care. Cheers, guys.

**Intermediate:**

> Yes. So, you know, we've been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey. So you'll get, hopefully, no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we're going to talk about today. And today we are going to talk about the highlights from Token 2049. And was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world? Joining me is Bob Summerwell. Bob, you want to do a quick intro?

**Intermediate:**

> Practically illegal. Yes, exactly. I think booth babes are gone. But Token was very much like a booth babe conference. And in fact, they were sort of like, almost like seemingly more of them than last year. And then this led to like, does this mean we're near the top? Like, You know, like, is the price speculation at a maximum at this moment? And I got... You know, it wasn't euphoria. But people were feeling pretty good. And I like a conference when people are feeling a little shitty. Right. Because then, you know, there's room for things to run. I think... yeah like for better for worse interest in the industry as a whole just trends upwards with prices so like it's good for us for for prices to go up um but um Yeah, I mean, I could see, I think the digital asset treasuries too are also evidence that it's kind of late cycle. But even still, stuff is just happening really quickly. I think products kind of mostly work in crypto now. There's a strange moment where like DeFi just worked. And this is part of the reason why we really got into it. It definitely like only kind of worked through 2021, 2022, maybe even 2023. And then it just kind of functions and it's big. Like every week or so I see of the ave people tweet like how big it would be compared to the us banks and it's like 47 43 36 uh you know it's running um and so there's a feeling of inevitability that kicked in for me like a couple months ago that you know has has i've never quite felt what about you bob what did you find you know on the craziness level what do you think is
