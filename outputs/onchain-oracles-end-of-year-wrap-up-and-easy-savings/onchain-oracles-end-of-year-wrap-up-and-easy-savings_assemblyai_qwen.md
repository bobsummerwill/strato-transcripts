**[00:04] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, we are live. Welcome to this week's On Chain Oracles. As usual, I am joined. I'm Victor Wong, founder and chief product officer at Strato. And as usual, I am joined with Kieren James-Lubin, CEO of Strato, and the man with the oranges, Jim Hermes, CTO of Strato, from sunny California.

**[00:32] SPEAKER_01:** That's not so sunny right now.

**[00:34] SPEAKER_00:** Have you eaten many oranges or are they just—

**[00:38] SPEAKER_01:** There's a tree behind me.

**[00:40] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, nice. Well, this week we are going to do our crypto year-in-review recap. But before we get into that, two quick things. One is, at some point during the show, I will announce a special giveaway, and it's going to be a really special year-end giveaway. But in preparation, we recommend that everyone get a Strato account if you don't have one already and join our Telegram because those will be two parts of it. And before we get into the URL—

**[01:14] SPEAKER_02:** For the to sign up.

**[01:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, thank you. It is Strato—S-T-R-A-T-O—Nexus to sign up.

**[01:25] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, and you can go straight to app.StratoNexus.

**[01:29] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, thanks, Kieren. And then we are joined by Michael Tan today for our Strato Spotlight because we have lots of new features to show. Michael, what do you have for us today to talk—

**[01:46] SPEAKER_03:** Hi everyone. I'm showing you guys the Easy Savings package path today. Basically, it's bridging in stables from Ethereum and saving them, earning yield in the lending pool. So I start by connecting my Ethereum wallet. As such, it's a really simple process as long as you have it in the browser. My wallet is connected. I can pick between USDC and USDT. We're going to be adding a couple of different stables soon, including yield-bearing ones. Bridge in 100 here. Make sure this is checked so that it goes directly into the lending pool. We just add these cool modals, but you just need to confirm everything. Sign the permit, confirm the transaction. Why is it—All right, there you go. Takes a couple of seconds, waiting for the all safe. Great. Now, should be receiving the deposit one to two minutes into the lending pool. And that is your Easy Savings—the fastest and easiest way to earn money, earn points on Strato.

**[02:55] SPEAKER_00:** And now, so in the background, what's happening, Michael? It looks like we're converting from USDC into our local stables, USDST, and then putting it into the lending pool. Is that right?

**[03:08] SPEAKER_03:** Yep, that's correct. And you could do the same with USDT if you'd like.

**[03:12] SPEAKER_00:** Awesome.

**[03:13] SPEAKER_03:** And we also have a bridge-out feature if you ever need that over here. But for now, this is the easiest way to get money in the lending pool and start earning.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_00:** Cool. And as Rowan knows, we launched our Season One reward program roughly two weeks ago. So how's that going, Michael?

**[03:31] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, so we have quite a bit of points that have been issued. You can kind of check it here—the leaderboard—if you go to this tab. You can also go here to go directly to the leaderboard from the sidebar. But as it currently stands, looks like I'm number 13 on this. You can check out the different activities in the network that are being done to earn points as well. The rewards here—these are your different positions—are currently earning points. And this is my lending pool from Easy Savings.

**[04:04] SPEAKER_00:** Awesome. Well, you've got to bump up your activity to get up on the chart. Yeah, get to the top three soon. Well, thank you for joining us, Michael. And we look forward to the next segment. So with that, great being here. Take care.

**[04:19] SPEAKER_02:** Thanks, Michael.

**[04:21] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, so let's talk about the crypto year in review. This has been, like, when I kind of reflected, I realized this has been a crazy year for crypto in general. And I think for us specifically, there's just been so much going on. So let's start with what you think is the biggest story of the year. And I'm going to start with Jim. Jim, from your boat—

**[04:49] SPEAKER_01:** You know, I want to push back a little bit on this one because—I'm not going to push back. I'm going to answer the question. But I found this the least interesting of the questions because, by definition, the biggest story is the stuff that we've all been talking about nonstop all year anyway. It's the stuff that's been in the news. So my answers are just going to be boring and obvious. In crypto in general—well, sorry—it's Black Gaps. The big story was that this was a development year. We spent the whole year. We figured out what we wanted to do early on. We spent the whole year really making a great product and only released it in the last few months. So that is the big story from us. In crypto in general, the big story was just the crazy ride that crypto took. Bitcoin was down, then it was up, then it was down again. I don't even know where it is today. Somewhere in the middle of the year, I have this memory of seeing Eric Trump 5 in Toronto introducing some crypto projects. So it's just been a crazy ride this year in crypto. But I will pass it on.

**[05:58] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, Kieren, what was your biggest story of the year?

**[06:01] SPEAKER_02:** Okay, so I'll quibble with Jim a little bit. I think mine's a bit of a meta story. So it depends what you mean by "big." I have a little bit of a philosophical objection to news. News is always point-in-time and doesn't really tell you trend. I think we would agree on this. And people who over-index on the current and under-index on what's really going on—you know, the biggest one for me was that adoption and price have continued to decouple. We started to see maybe in 2023–2024 that the supply of stables on-chain, which was previously correlated with crypto prices, started to stop being correlated with crypto prices. Stables on-chain are at all-time high, and transaction volumes in stables doubled again between 2024 and 2025, I believe. I asked the AIs this—they all said that. At the same time, prices are a little bit down from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. So this may just be how it is for a while. There are also other metrics: active wallets are up by maybe 10 million, depending on the time interval you consider. There are different estimates. Mobile is up 20-ish percent. And institutions are clearly doing more than wading in—they're actually quietly moving money with stables, especially around the world. There's more of a recurring institutional buy happening. Part of the reason crypto has been so volatile is that a bunch of very aggressive speculators are buying and selling rapidly. If you compare stocks, the stocks that get included in the major indexes—quite often people have their send $500 a month to Vanguard, and that smooths out the volatility to some degree in high, medium-to-high market cap stocks.

**[08:14] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[08:15] SPEAKER_02:** That's actually starting to happen a little bit in crypto. And I think at some point you'll see some of the dapps get included in indexes. So that same pool of capital will start to flow into crypto. It's been friendly on the regulatory side, at least largely. The U.S. is passing some of the laws. The laws may not be perfect, but they're better than before. And the behavior of the regulatory agencies is far less aggressive—far less arbitrary and capricious, if you will. And yet the prices are not up. So to me, this is okay. It might be a sign of maturity, but this is the story.

**[08:54] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I do think part of it might be that the adoption from institutions and more mainstream things is a leading indicator of where it goes. It's not like some big BlackRock announces some big thing and they turn it on immediately.

**[09:11] SPEAKER_02:** So, maybe it does feel like to me that most of the time, institutions are early, and retail price action comes later. You see that like funding private companies—you need retail or the public markets to get that next liquidity. Right? I'm not sure—because there was a time, during the pandemic, when everyone had their stimulus checks and was gambling at home.

**[09:47] SPEAKER_00:** Like retail—everything, not just crypto.

**[09:52] SPEAKER_02:** GameStop era. So I don't know what the trend is like now. I guess that was all stuff that was funded in 2017–2018 by ICOs, which were a mix of institutional and crypto whale retail and so on. So I don't know. I think retail comes back, but it's a different form than the last time. Like, most people that trade in general—this includes stock day trading—something like 90% lose. One of our employees is fond of saying 90% lose, and on average it takes 18 to 24 months for them to admit it and stop and just hodl or, in effect.

**[10:46] SPEAKER_00:** So for me, I think the biggest story—well, maybe I'll start with the crypto one and then just a general theme, right? The crypto one is the return of building that matters in the crypto space. What I mean by that is, in the previous year, it was sort of the rise of meme coins. People were just kind of letting marketing win the day. It was the people who could make a big splash or excitement in the market. And I was kind of shocked when I looked at the timeline that the Libra coin was in February of this year—it feels so long ago. But now you see the projects that are rising, like Zcash—the rise of Zcash—projects that have been building for a long time and really investing on the infrastructure side. Even institutions are getting involved on the infrastructure side, like Temple by Stripe or things like Robinhood doing their own too. So as builders ourselves, I like the trend back toward building, and I think that's a big trend this year. But I think part of the other trend, which is directly related to crypto, is that AI has gotten really, really good and it affects everything, but it certainly affects my day-to-day and our day-to-day ability to deliver. Like, our mutual friend Stephen Chu just published, I think, the first theoretical physics paper co-authored by an AI. He describes AI at this point as a super genius that is kind of crazy—which is exactly the thing. Yes, it does lead you on some odd goose chases sometimes. Hallucination isn't over, but its potential to shortcut so many things is so powerful. Well, you guys, I think we're going—

**[12:52] SPEAKER_01:** Through a phase right now—in the last couple of months—where people are figuring out the limits of AI, which is a step in this process. Early in the year, it just looked like magic and could do everything. But we knew it wasn't doing everything because it hasn't taken over the world yet. Now we're understanding what it can and can't do.

**[13:19] SPEAKER_00:** And even how to check what it should be doing. Right? I think when we just took the outputs and assumed they were okay—but like, checking it—what do you think, Kieren?

**[13:32] SPEAKER_02:** Let me add an example. I've talked a bunch of times about getting back into writing code because the AI is so good. I thought that applied mostly to the app layer of our stack. For those who haven't seen it, we have an app that lets you save in high-quality assets, participate in swap pools, lending pools, all that sort of thing. It looks like somewhere between a DeFi app—it's definitely DeFi in architecture—and a Coinbase-style Apple application. The AI is actually really good at writing code in the app layer. But I didn't think—so we also have our own in-house blockchain that we worked on for years, starting with being an Ethereum mainnet client, kind of forking off for enterprise use, and then going back to being our own standalone L1. I didn't think the AI was going to be ready to help code in the really hardcore platform layer. But at least for simpler stuff, I discovered a couple of weeks ago that it can. If I describe the thing—you have to have a good instinct for how the pieces work together. Like, the peer-to-peer process is doing this, and we see this in the logs, and then the data is getting to the VM this way—I still have all of that, but I can barely write the Haskell anymore. But I don't have to if I keep it pretty constrained. And this is like a surgical fix, not a big rewrite. I couldn't do a big rewrite, but I could just describe what's wrong and what's probably right, and it more or less gets it right. I don't think it could do the Haskell six months ago. It's pretty good now—for surgical fixes, not really big stuff. But each part of our stack getting more accessible to AI is a remarkable change. I'd also say—I remember when I was very good at .NET new code snippets but couldn't read a code base. Now it can read a code base—maybe as of a year ago, maybe 8–10 months—it can read a code base so much faster than I can that I just don't need to read the code base except line by line on a specific issue. Sorry, go ahead.

**[15:52] SPEAKER_01:** So Stephen did say something in the podcast that—until he said it, I was kind of intuiting it, but it was an aha moment when he said it. I've been wondering why, even though I have all these amazing tools, sometimes I'm not going a lot faster—and in fact, sometimes I'm even slowed down. He expressed something he experienced in writing the physics paper, which is the wild goose chase problem. These things know too much and can throw out lots of great ideas, and you can go off and spend hours researching the ideas and end up wasting more time. A lot of them don't pan out. Some do. Sometimes I learn enough that I get some lifetime tool out of it that it was worth it. But I'm wasting a lot of time just slavishly doing what the AI wants me to do. And I've gotten a little bit ruder with the AI lately, telling it, "That's a stupid idea. I'm not going to waste my—"

**[16:59] SPEAKER_02:** But yeah, that also—it sometimes feels like there are certain types of attorneys or accountants or whatever professional service workers who want the belt-and-suspenders thing. Like, let me give the answer that minimizes my risk as the professional service provider—oh, and by the way, maybe cost the client a lot of time and money. I agree—you have to yell at it when it gets a little too—I don't know.

**[17:29] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, and the thing is also—I think the thing with Steve that he also said, by the way, everyone should check out the latest episode on the Manifold podcast because he did the paper with the AI on physics, which I don't understand, Jim—you're gonna have to explain to me one day.

**[17:48] SPEAKER_03:** But—

**[17:49] SPEAKER_00:** But he also did another paper on how he used the AI to write the paper, and that I found fascinating. I feel like we're entering what I call the centaur phase. There was this phase in chess with AI where the best chess players were actually computer chess engines combined with expert chess players. Right? And I feel like that's where we are now. You need some level—you need to be an expert yourself to be able to evaluate the output of what the AI does. And you can't always just say, "Oh, the AI should know what it is."

**[18:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, but it's like the AI telling the master chess player to go off and play 20 games to try different things out or something.

**[18:36] SPEAKER_02:** The solution is to ask the other AI.

**[18:38] SPEAKER_00:** To play things—not clean. That's right. Like, double-check that thing, though, you—

**[18:42] SPEAKER_01:** Know, you don't even have to ask another AI. These things are myopic enough that if you just turn around and ask the same AI, sometimes it's very angry at its own first answer. What irritates me a lot is when it says, "Here is a snippet of code for you to try out." I try it and it doesn't work. I come back to it, and the AI is like, "You're an idiot for trying that snippet of code. Obviously it would work."

**[19:12] SPEAKER_00:** One area AIs have not gotten down though is spatial reasoning. I did ask it to come up with a design for a box and give me the lumber that I needed. I just grabbed the list, ran off, got it, and came back—and it was totally wrong. When I looked at the diagram, the wood had overlapped with each other in space. Things like that—spatial reasoning seems like it's still lacking.

**[19:41] SPEAKER_02:** You would need to train it on a bunch of engineering diagrams or something. That's actually—someone should do that. I'm surprised; probably a bunch of people are working on it.

**[19:52] SPEAKER_00:** I'm sure they're working on it. And I think this is sort of in the space between the diffusion models and the LLMs. So I think that's where—when you ask spatial relationship questions, you can be sent to one or the other, and it sometimes gets confused. Okay, second big category: biggest surprise of the year. I'm gonna start with Kieren. What's that?

**[20:18] SPEAKER_02:** Okay, so I thought about this. I have a two-part answer, slightly related. October 10th—that was like a Friday. I think we had wrapped some work up. I can't remember exactly what was going on. But then it just—was it November 10th? 10/10? Right.

**[20:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[20:41] SPEAKER_02:** And then just like everything blew up. You're up the next one—it's like, whoa—like 20 billion. It was like the 20x larger liquidation than ever happened before. I guess there's a lot more leverage in the system with HyperLiquid and all these. But it was a perfect storm of circumstances, and it happened so fast. I guess all financial markets are like this—things can just explode in an instant if there's enough liquidity and derivatives. Right? But that was wild. I'm gonna add a related but on the edge: metals are at an all-time high right now. Yes, when we were starting to build out metals, we acquired some for direct sale on our version one marketplace. Our average silver cost basis was like $25–$27–$29. It's over $70 now—at least in the last day. I don't know what it's at right now. Gold is also at all-time high, and crypto's down. It sort of shows—I've believed this for a while, but I hope it maybe becomes not true in the future—that mostly crypto does not behave like a defensive asset. It behaves like a high-beta tech stock. It's risk-on. So if the major tech companies go down, Bitcoin goes down, and vice versa. It's not always true. I think on Liberation Day, we saw that happen for both, and then crypto actually went up—sort of a "if they're going to restrict the movement of goods and they're not going to restrict the movement of crypto, it's hard to do"—why is this? I think it's just the same type of people buying both, and they see it as a future-facing technology speculative asset.

**[22:49] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, for a long time people have pointed out that if you look at crypto, instead of acting as a hedge against the stock market, it acts as more of a high-alpha line of the stock market, which rather—

**[23:03] SPEAKER_02:** Early on, Bitcoin was totally uncorrelated with the stock market. But I think it probably started being correlated at least by 2020, but maybe even like 2018.

**[23:18] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, Jim, what was your biggest surprise of the year?

**[23:22] SPEAKER_01:** So I'm gonna say the return of—even though it never went away. And by the way, this might be recency bias because this has all been the last couple of months in my world—but the return of ZK into the world. Suddenly, about two months ago, I started hearing everybody talk about it again. When we were down in Argentina, a lot of the talks were about that board meeting. People were all asking us, "What's your ZK strategy?" You guys all of a sudden got really interested in the Zcash client that I had worked a bit on a couple years ago. It looks like it's probably real right now because there are certain applications that are actually working—although I won't say which. But I went to a bunch of talks in Argentina that clearly were vaporware. Maybe that's even generous—things that didn't make sense to me. But there are a couple of applications, and the scaling application that will probably happen in Ethereum could be big.

**[24:33] SPEAKER_00:** It's kind of exciting. Yeah, I mean, if you look at the trend lines, it's crazy. I think last year to do a proof on the Ethereum blockchain testnet, it took like a computer with 48 GPUs, and now it's down to 4. So it's really accelerating. Yeah, I'm not sure why that's happening, but it does seem to be positive.

**[24:57] SPEAKER_02:** I think many things are true at once. On the why—this is speculation—but one: the EU came out and said, "Oh, you're going to need a driver's license to use the Internet." And this scared the crap out of everybody. We weren't taking the privacy thing seriously—we just wanted to pump these prices. But are they gonna make me put my fingerprint on my computer to turn it on? No one has suggested that yet, but the cypherpunk fundamentals have come back into focus as governments seem to want to reassert or assert control over the Internet. And yeah, I think the privacy people were in the background. We went to the Cypherpunk Congress at the beginning of DevConnect, and clearly these people had just been there for 10 years. We kind of forgot about them, and they're just still there. But as a meta—like, the Zcash price went crazy. I think definitely some people were trying to find a way to rotate out of something into something else without making it look like they're selling the thing. And it's also—I think, yeah, maybe also like post-meme coins, there was a value rediscovery going on. Even the more extractive crypto types seem to have some cypherpunk inclination—not always. There's a lot of new entrants that are more like the Wall Street personality, but I think some mix of organic and manufactured got the price action going again. One thing that occurred to me as I started researching privacy again—because we spent lots of time with it both in our enterprise days and then subsequently trying to figure it out before Mainnet launch, which is why Jim built most of the Zcash client and then we kind of dropped it for a while—but part of the reason it came back for me is that it also seems more viable. There's a bunch of competing Ethereum ecosystem privacy products like Railgun, Privacy Pools, and so on. I guess Roman Storm was in the news a bunch during the year—Roman Storm of Tornado Cash, of course. And I didn't realize that it kind of maybe basically works. Zcash also added a mobile wallet now that supposedly just works.

**[27:42] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[27:44] SPEAKER_02:** And it's easy to shield. It wasn't easy to shield before. So some perfect storm of factors seem to reignite the privacy thing.

**[27:52] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I think part of it is just people realize—as maybe a new kind of mainstream adoption is taking place—people are realizing, "Oh, crap, my balances are in fact public."

**[28:08] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, there's a wrench attack per year, per week in 2025, something like that.

**[28:14] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So like, I think there was an assumption that my balance is worse—but I think for mainstream audiences, now they're not. So my biggest surprise of the year was really the Robinhood announcement. And it wasn't that Robinhood was doing stuff in crypto—we knew that forever. But the many things they announced at the same time—like their own L2, their own tokenization engine, secondary stocks, and pushing it out immediately—I think it got everyone really interested and excited. I think that sort of put in the arms race of institutional adoption. Right? I think that kick-started it, and it was surprising because—like, we're on the board of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. We talked to—we have a lot of connections with enterprises still, even though we're out of that business. And it caught a lot of those companies off guard. We had conversations with a bunch of other companies like, "Explain to me what Robinhood is doing," which is kind of interesting. Okay, next one. We never like to talk bad about anything, but what was your biggest disappointment this year? I'm going to start this one off. I think, like I mentioned before, Libra was this year—it was February this year. It was kind of shocking—the level of interest, manipulation. When the whole story came out, that something could get effectively to the presidential office of a government in order to do that—so in that way, it was kind of shocking to me. I know, Kieren, you have more pro-meme coin than me. But it's sort of—I think, on the good side, it seemed to be the death knell of meme coins. So even though the actual incident was pretty disappointing from my point of view, the consequences put the industry in a much more positive direction. What do you think? What's your biggest disappointment?

**[30:35] SPEAKER_02:** So I'm gonna mostly agree, but with a different take. I'd say the nature of the meme flame-out—you know, I think I'm sort of excited about all of the activity and the government kind of getting pro-crypto in the U.S. in the Meme Revolution—we'll see. But the way—I guess it takes a certain amount of expertise to embrace crypto the right way or a certain level of non-cynicism or something. They could have just hodled. But yeah, I think—in principle, there's no reason that meme coins have to be a pump-and-dump vehicle.

**[31:25] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[31:25] SPEAKER_02:** Like, some people say Bitcoin is the original meme coin. Yeah, and Doge is just still here and big and still kind of funny. And like Pump.fun—just so strongly orients the economics of the system. And I'm not saying it's anyone's fault for participating in it on either side—launching the meme coins or buying and selling them. But again, 90% of people lose. It's mostly about timing. You've got to just know when they launch, buy them really fast, sell them right away. And this is a reliable way to make money from some group of gamblers who eventually—then they haven't totally stopped, but will eventually stop playing in this particular casino. And it's like—it doesn't need to be like that. I think Bass tried to rebrand them to like creator coins. But most of the problems—incentives are about timing. Right? Like if you just forced some sort of hold—if the meme coins vested, maybe it would be fine. But we're just dumping them on retail. And so, NFTs had a phase like this. Some of them will kick around. They kind of came back in a rhyming way as meme coins, which were even more liquid and able to trade concepts. And I've said before, there's a sense in which meme coins are like the flip side of prediction markets—they're just a measure of what people believe. But the design is bad from a market structure perspective, and as a norm—it's like everyone opted into this, but it still kind of looks gross when you look at it.

**[33:24] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean, I think it's the difference between a speculator versus a builder mindset. We know it takes time to build stuff—building audiences, building products—it just takes time. AI has sped that up, but you have to invest that and have that longer-term outlook. Okay, Jim, what's your biggest disappointment of the year?

**[33:46] SPEAKER_01:** And I'm going to assume you're not talking about—you don't want me to talk about the fact that crypto coins didn't stay at an all-time high forever. And at some point—

**[33:57] SPEAKER_00:** You know, I had to tell many people, "Hey, now that we have to manage our treasury and this is going to go up forever"—I'm like, "Wait a second, it's not gonna go up forever. Nothing ever goes up forever."

**[34:14] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I'm gonna go a little bit more myopic—look in the development of our products and treat it as a lesson maybe. I think my disappointment was various features that we had put into the product that were sort of an extension to Ethereum. We do have some good extensions to Ethereum that we're keeping in there, but various parts we sort of had to pull out. For instance, we had taken identity, turned it into a username, built a lot of security around that, and turned that into a first-class citizen so that it wasn't something built upon it. We sort of had to pull that out because we realized we have to—especially with the new direction of the company—really integrate with things that are out there. So even something like using a wallet became hard when the first thing you have to do in the wallet is have the address database, and I'm like, "Well, we're not really based on addresses." So some cool things were pulled out. But the important thing is realizing that there is a whole ecosystem out there and we are part of that now, and we have to stay within the parameters of that ecosystem.

**[35:40] SPEAKER_02:** Let me add—so many. No one really loves Solidity. People are probably almost instantly on arrival unhappy with the ERC-20 standard. Yeah, yeah—someone who maybe worked on it, Bob would have to tell the story, but instantly started dedicating his life to trying to move to a different standard that's mostly the same but better, gets rid of the approves.

**[36:12] SPEAKER_01:** And I'm on the record for saying that I'm very pro-UTXO vs. Merkle Patricia for data. But yeah.

**[36:21] SPEAKER_02:** Likes something UTXO-flavored better—including me. We're just stuck somehow with ERC-20. It's like—Solidity and ERC-20 is the COBOL of the ecosystem. It's going to be here. People keep trying. I mean, Solana kind of made Rust smart contracts work. But that's like the only other example really. Everyone goes off and invents some UTXO thing because it's much cleaner conceptually, and then the devs don't use it and it doesn't integrate. I guess I would say partial exception with some of the privacy tools, but the ones that people use are built on a base of ERC-20 or Zcash.

**[37:12] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, yes, but like—it's one of these things where every developer always wants to write like—"This language is terrible. I'm going to write my own language. It's going to be so much better." And no one ever uses that language. Right? Like, what actually happens is people make JavaScript much faster.

**[37:34] SPEAKER_01:** We kind of have an internal joke because I won't mention any names, but we had a developer once—we assigned this, the last company we worked on.

**[37:45] SPEAKER_00:** We assigned this—the last company we worked on.

**[37:49] SPEAKER_02:** Last company.

**[37:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. We asked him to do task A, and he was like, "Before I can do task A, I have to rewrite the language and create a rules engine that would be used so that..." I don't know. So we always use the phrase "rules engine" whenever somebody wants to go out and build it. But it still was—you know, it's one thing to be able to build cool new additions. It was a little sad this year to actually have to sit there and rip out cool new additions to be compliant.

**[38:18] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[38:19] SPEAKER_02:** So we'll add more in time.

**[38:22] SPEAKER_00:** But it's funny that in many ways we got back to basics—not only from the tech, but even in branding. Right? We went back to our original Strato name, even though we had been kind of adding over to it. And that takes us back 10 years. So—okay—Strato update and roadmap. So, Kieren, I looked back at this. I think at the end of 2024, our TVL on Strato was slightly less than $100,000. It is currently about over $9 million.

**[38:58] SPEAKER_02:** 90x in the year is pretty good.

**[39:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, exactly. Can you give a quick update about what's happening with the project and any things that you want to let people know to look forward to in the coming year?

**[39:12] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, well, I think at the top level we're trying to make the thing useful and popular. It's tricky how to measure that. Right? But more TVL is a good proxy. The thing is generating revenue now—should generate more. The CDP and the lending pools are just—there's a little bit of interest accruing every day for the protocol. It's like, whoa. And the swap pools too. We'll see lots more assets. So at the moment, we've got four first-class assets and then LP tokens of different types, including our native yield coin, which is driven by our lending pool. There'll be lots more—from tokenized stocks, which are all third-party issued. If they're available within DeFi, we can kind of copy and
