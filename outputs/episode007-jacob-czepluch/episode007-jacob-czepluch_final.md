**[0:00] SPEAKER_01:** So , hello , hello , Bob . so , yes , I'm Bob Summerwill , recording here at Devcon Prague for Early Days of Ethereum . And I have here , how Good you ? Good Gudnason . enough , Good enough , yes . there you go . So , we've known each other about three years or so now . I , I think we did meet in , Bogota in for Devcon 6 for the first time , where you introduced yourself , I you introduced yourself . was not aware of your of background and role . But time . but , specifically , I , , specifically i , you were an intern at Dev , in Berlin in late 2015 , and you also attended Devcon 1 . So . how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time ?

**[0:54] SPEAKER_00:** Oh , thank you for the intro and good question . it was in Bogota . i think I knew about you or of you for longer for longer than since then . But since , for longer than you or of you for longer than then , But , with someone , I think Florian you were chatting with someone , someone and talking about Florian Glatz , maybe , and talking about the old days . And I , and just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum . and , I did my internship working on working the Python client back , starting in August or September , starting September August or September or August 2015 , 2015 . I think it was like maybe August internship working on the Python client , starting September or August , 2015 . I think it August like December to December , it was August to , it was August of to December Mainnet . It was the a couple of weeks after mainnet launched . And the first week I was there was when there was like the first , big fork where the Go client forked , forked from the , C++ c and Python client python . There was a chain split on mainnet , yes . and presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group . Oh it goodness . happened when do you think that started ? I , I when it think , the second day I was there . And , and that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the , office in , right . Right , so everything was extremely chaotic and people arrived at the 14th of July , 2015 . And was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office . So everything was extremely chaotic and office for the meetup , and nothing happened for a good for of the meetup And eventually , and nothing just happened there in for corner a , and good amount of time . and eventually I was just sitting there . And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting in write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin . So the was an internship while you corner still doing an undergraduate ? It was an internship that I got because I wrote my working thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015 . So you had , and , but just a bachelor . And I was like , no , we , was can't do this because there's so many people who are just looking just , Some looking started . Some leaving . So I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I that had given , a couple of weeks before back in Copenhagen . prior

**[2:26] SPEAKER_01:** to your internship ?

**[2:28] SPEAKER_00:** I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a copenhagen Ethereum meetup group . Oh contact Ethereum the Ethereum that I had given a couple of weeks before back in Copenhagen . Prior to your internship ? I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum , goodness . So when do you think I . goodness ? issue I know 2015 exactly . So C++ it or started like . It

**[2:34] SPEAKER_01:** when

**[2:34] SPEAKER_00:** on

**[2:34] SPEAKER_01:** do you think that , started .

**[2:34] SPEAKER_00:** Right ,

**[2:35] SPEAKER_01:** ? I

**[2:35] SPEAKER_00:** And the

**[2:35] SPEAKER_01:** , but

**[2:36] SPEAKER_00:** know

**[2:35] SPEAKER_01:** , We

**[2:36] SPEAKER_00:** exactly

**[2:35] SPEAKER_01:** this bachelor thesis ,

**[2:36] SPEAKER_00:** when

**[2:36] SPEAKER_01:** and two

**[2:36] SPEAKER_00:** it started

**[2:36] SPEAKER_01:** friends ,

**[2:37] SPEAKER_00:** . It

**[2:36] SPEAKER_01:** shared

**[2:37] SPEAKER_00:** started on the 14th of July , 2015 , right , right . And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science , and I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin .

**[2:51] SPEAKER_01:** So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate an ?

**[2:55] SPEAKER_00:** It was an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015 . So you had graduated spring of 2015 thesis on Bitcoin . So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate . It was an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015 . but just a bachelor . right . And , but ecosystem , just so a bachelor , was . Right back , and right . We were because the ecosystem two , so to continue . So to speak , was so , I'm gonna do this . And a couple weeks later I moved to small to do my internship working on the Python client . And , that was back then interesting time .

**[3:09] SPEAKER_01:** Right

**[3:09] SPEAKER_00:** back

**[3:10] SPEAKER_01:** , right .

**[3:11] SPEAKER_00:** , I . write we things or take more were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship . Like , right , I mean I , I opened my first issue in March 2015 , right to the C++ client or something like that , so , I , I think i the I've the i've known of Ethereum since end of 2014 . But , we were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship . I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to the C++ client or something like that . So , I've known of Ethereum since end , bachelor anyway , me , of me and two of my friends they are right now . But , enjoyed it a lot . So , I mean , it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office . But also Felix Lange , I know , was there on the Geth team . We foundation , and then wrote got this bachelor thesis , me and two , two of my of my , friends my , and we shared it with the foundation and foundation then we got offered internships , And I was the only the one was . Like stuff . And , the I was tired there of I studying already , only after a bachelor , and the other two guys wanted to continue . So I was like , I'm gonna do this . And a couple weeks later I moved to , Berlin to berlin to do my internship working on the Python client python , right , that was a very interesting , they , there and back now , I'm more , or write , more things continue . So I was like , I'm gonna do this . And a couple weeks later I moved to Berlin to do my a working on the Python client . That very a interesting of different people around . And also quite often people would come and visit from other places . I remember a couple of times time Christoph Jentzsch came to visit . There was one time . Thinking think he arrived at midnight or something like back now , I'm sad I didn't write down more things or , or no take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit But . But I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are , right . but , i enjoyed it a lot .

**[4:23] SPEAKER_01:** I mean , it was primarily was primarily c C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office , right . But . but also Felix Lang Lange , I know , was there on the . C++ team . enjoyed it a lot . I mean , it was primarily C++ and under Gav that was happening in that office . But also Felix Lange , I know , was then on the Geth team some and then and then : Python . I , I think And I think he . doing Geth , And , the Solidity team was also I . I

**[4:35] SPEAKER_00:** think

**[4:35] SPEAKER_01:** they were

**[4:36] SPEAKER_00:** he

**[4:36] SPEAKER_01:** the

**[4:36] SPEAKER_00:** was

**[4:36] SPEAKER_01:** .

**[4:36] SPEAKER_00:** doing

**[4:36] SPEAKER_01:** ,

**[4:36] SPEAKER_00:** GHOST stuff . wrote

**[4:38] SPEAKER_01:** ,

**[4:38] SPEAKER_00:** the .

**[4:39] SPEAKER_01:** ,

**[4:38] SPEAKER_00:** if , would be And around , the Solidity team was also there . I think they were under the C++ team plus , that's right . they were there . And Remix as well . well . Mix , sorry , sorry , at the time , and I also remember the Mist . I guess at least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around . So there was a good amount of whatever . So different was just like , oh , it's fine . I have . I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway . I had like the smallest room , just like a small room with a bed . Nothing else . So I enjoyed spending a lot of time . people around . And also quite often people would come and well . At the time . And I also remember the Mist . I guess at least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around . So there was a good amount of different people around . And also quite often visit from other places . I remember a couple of times Christoph sleep Jentzsch the came was to nice visit So , There was one time where I he remember at midnight a couple and of times , Christoph was no Jentzsch came to visit . There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight the office or midnight something like that and there were no one else at the office . I was doing my internship and I think he wrote late afternoon , he wrote on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever got to know him , he told me about , right testing he was doing and how they were testing . It was quite interesting . And . cross-client testing as well , right it ? Right , So I was just like , oh like he was building a lot of just , it's fine . I had nothing i to do in Berlin anyway berlin . I had like the smallest room , just like a small room with a bed , someone around and that he was a little bit delayed . So I was just like , oh , it's fine . I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway . I had like the smallest room , just like a small room nothing else , so I else enjoyed leading spending the a lot from of , but time running in against the Python office Geth . and . I . i sounds about right . enjoyed , I have , and . because the a was lot of time and in because like you told me we don't have too much time the office and I had like short . But , I , I would usually just stay in the office . And then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice , right . So , I had one night where one I think i left , him into the office at office at , at midnight and we had , had a little bit of a chat . I got to know him , right . He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing , right . It testing as well , wasn't it ? Right was quite . If I remember correctly like he was building interesting lot of like just JSON . And they fed to the client and ? Right , if i remember correctly like he was building a lot of , like just json data that they fit to the client and that's cross client testing as well . And that was , chat . I got to wasn't him . He told me it all the testing he was doing ? how they were testing . was quite interesting . That , cross-client

**[6:02] SPEAKER_01:** testing

**[6:03] SPEAKER_00:** . If I remember correctly , was he was building a lot of JSON data that they Python to the client he was building was a the lot of . know that cpp-ethereum Cpp Ethereum was leading , were generated from that , JSON then running data that they fed to the client . That

**[6:11] SPEAKER_01:** was

**[6:11] SPEAKER_00:** from the

**[6:11] SPEAKER_01:** this point in

**[6:11] SPEAKER_00:** C++

**[6:11] SPEAKER_01:** because plus client . I know that C++ Ethereum was leading And the tests were generated kind of from off . And you also . that . So you also had , but know , Ming Chan , her first official date then first of running of 2015 . those , against have those the of cost-cutting measures coming in quite fast of looking Python the and Geth and clients .

**[6:22] SPEAKER_00:** probably , that sounds about sounds right . but , I have are there a lot of small stories the July of the though . you we told me we don't we don't have too much , and I'll try to keep it short . But , I , I , you had the crowd sale , but like nearly all of the money was gone . So if I think back to , like the you most interesting things that have happened , those it I kind think of course of being lucky cost enough to cutting participate at measures Devcon 1 coming , at in , 1 quite . Right fast . And of also the looking most kind at of interesting the that was spend taking where things at you this know that it happened had time been because going , it Foundation a I year think . almost It ran out of was . like the C++ team was kind of cut off the . And July of course being lucky enough to at Devcon . 1 . And also experience experiencing the . kind of split that was taking place at this point in time because the Foundation I think almost ran out of money . And , that's right . The C++ also , so you team had , you know was Ming Chan kind her first of date was first of August of 2015 . So , you have those kind of cut cutting measures coming in quite off , And you also had Ming Chan you know , it had first official . was , but , I didn't have any of with Ming back then . 2015 , you have those kind of cost-cutting measures of in quite fast , looking at the spend . You know , date had was going first a year of It was

**[7:08] SPEAKER_01:** August

**[7:07] SPEAKER_00:** on the C++ team in

**[7:07] SPEAKER_01:** London .

**[7:08] SPEAKER_00:** But

**[7:08] SPEAKER_01:** a couple of

**[7:08] SPEAKER_00:** Foundation had been formed , and you

**[7:09] SPEAKER_01:** , told 2015 we can't . So anyway because like you have those kind of cost cutting measures coming in quite fast , looking at the spend where you know it had been going for a year . It was July the July of july the previous year that the foundation had been formed and you had the crowd sale crowd but like nearly all of the money was gone . because they were

**[7:29] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[7:29] SPEAKER_01:** rapidly

**[7:30] SPEAKER_00:** think that was also maybe not the most responsible usage that was also maybe not of money , but also the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly . that's right . The Ether price itself was also , I think it dipped below the . at like September , And right like September , year in , and you've had no . I . one thing I just remembered Ether , price was itself to have was also , I think , probably already or that was coming . so that's why it below up the pre-sale team instead price at some point . And it's right like September in and had no accumulation , but , I didn't have the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner , I any interactions lot of fun kind of following how people came with went and went into Gavin's office and had a chat there with Ming , back Jutta back then . so maybe . one thing I just remembered now , I was supposed to have done my internship on the C++ team in London didn't really know in the . But , right . that I was , weeks sorry , I do it sorry , we , do it anyway because like we don't have . money . they , shut , entirely , I think . probably already or that was . already , that . coming . So that's why it ended because the was some budget . But , like sitting as the only person working on the Python client whatever . So that was sort of

**[8:15] SPEAKER_01:** the pre-formation of what became EthCore later . Parity . think .

**[8:17] SPEAKER_00:** , probably

**[8:17] SPEAKER_01:** So I was witnessing that without knowing what was going on .

**[8:18] SPEAKER_00:** already or that was coming . so that's why it ended up being the Python team instead because there was some budget some . but , like sitting as the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner , only found out about most of those things later . But , I mean maybe interesting to see . So I mean let maybe let's talk about Devcon 1 . So , you'd have this , so the first Devcon was Devcon Zero , which happened in I had a your time , which was the closed , you know , closed event , mainly Ethereum Foundation people , but some broader ecosystem people . But then Devcon 1 happened in lot of fun kind of following how people came and went what and became went Parity into later Gavin's office . and had , a I chat there with him and had or whatever . And I didn't really know in the beginning what was going on until I was also asked if I wanted to come in and talk . And so . And it was like presenting ideas of like what would happen next and would joining . next with the C++ team and to consider joining there or the That pre-formation of what became Ethcore later . Parity , there so or whatever . So that was sort of the pre-formation of what became Ethcore later , Parity . I think so . without knowing so I what I was that going knowing what on . I had no insight into like the finances of the foundation or anything like that . I only found out about most of those things later . But , so , maybe interesting to see . So let's I mean let's , talk about Devcon 1 . So , you'd have so this so Devcon first Devcon was so the first Devcon was But so , I mean maybe wanted to see which , So I happened in and , before talk time , And it was like presenting ideas of like what would happen next with the C++ team plus and team to right consider , there . whatever , but , so , i mean maybe interesting to see . so i mean let maybe let's , let's talk about Devcon ones So , you'd have , this so the first Devcon was Devcon zero That , sort of the people , what became Foundation people , later some , ecosystem Parity . in But happened . November I in think . so . had got announced early , the year and got cancelled . that this funding squeeze . did and ConsenSys organizing . So and filled that funding . and did some organizing . So that so was finances which in

**[9:07] SPEAKER_01:** November

**[9:07] SPEAKER_00:** which that in November 2014 , before your time

**[9:07] SPEAKER_01:** ,

**[9:07] SPEAKER_00:** which was

**[9:07] SPEAKER_01:** the closed event , mainly Ethereum

**[9:07] SPEAKER_00:** Foundation people , but some broader ecosystem people . But then Devcon 1 happened in November 2015 in London . It had got announced early in the year and got cancelled because of this funding squeeze . But then ConsenSys stepped up and filled

**[9:07] SPEAKER_01:** that of gap . It had got announced early in the

**[9:08] SPEAKER_00:** like

**[9:08] SPEAKER_01:** year and got cancelled because of

**[9:08] SPEAKER_00:** that . I only found out about most of those things later . But , maybe like that . i only found out about most of those things

**[9:11] SPEAKER_01:** ,

**[9:14] SPEAKER_01:** you . livestream know

**[9:18] SPEAKER_00:** that year . I was talk about Devcon 1 . So , the first Devcon was not 0 , which present in November 2014 myself before your time , which was the closed event I mainly Ethereum Foundation people , but some broader ecosystem people . But then Devcon 1 happened in November 2015 in London . It had got announced early in the year and got cancelled because of Foundation or anything like that . I only found out about most of those things . So let's But about Devcon 1 . The first Devcon was Devcon 0 , which happened in November 2014 , before your time , which was the closed event , mainly Ethereum Foundation people , then Consensys stepped , or whatever at the time , but I filled it then had got Devcon announced early one afford the to year and in got cancelled november because of 2015 this go squeeze . but then , watched stepped . the filled So . gap but , I did some organizing .

**[9:35] SPEAKER_01:** so was that ? It was for me , it was amazing . I've never been good at sitting still on a chair for a long period of time , but there I

**[9:36] SPEAKER_00:** a

**[9:36] SPEAKER_01:** watched every talk a that

**[9:39] SPEAKER_00:** of

**[9:40] SPEAKER_01:** the was livestream in November of that year . I was not present myself . I couldn't afford to go or whatever at the time or whatever at the time but i watched a lot of the but you . know , that was livestream . you know , that was a really very seminal conference . So how was that ? for was me , it was amazing . Like I've never been good at like sitting still on a chair for a long period but time , but there I was at every talk from the beginning in the morning until the end . I think I missed one talk because I had to go catch my was morning until ? For me ? It to go was on the last day . But it was . was just sitting there and sucking up all of these ideas and visions . And it was really . I think before that I had was just sitting there and sucking up all of these ideas and visions and it was really , I think before the I had an idea that I thought it would be interesting to continue working morning Ethereum or in until the end . I think I missed one talk Ethereum because I a missed long one period talk of because time I had to go catch my flight to go back on the last day . But . But live after it Devcon was 1 , I was just sitting there and sucking up all of Like , there's no other way for me . I'm not these ideas and visions and it was really , I think before that I had an idea that I thought it would be interesting be to continue working with Ethereum or in the Ethereum space . But I'm Devcon 1 I

**[10:28] SPEAKER_01:** That was a really very to do this . Like , conference . so how was that ?

**[10:34] SPEAKER_00:** not . it was amazing . in , Ethereum I'm to do after . 1 I was like , I have to do this . going , to the university . do . going to not going back to the university . I'm gonna do . Because it anything else . This is what I m gonna do . Because it was

**[10:35] SPEAKER_01:** still on a chair for a long period of time , but there I was at every talk from the

**[10:37] SPEAKER_00:** day

**[10:37] SPEAKER_01:** beginning in the morning until the end . I think I missed one talk because I had to go catch my flight to go back on

**[10:39] SPEAKER_00:** .

**[10:39] SPEAKER_01:** the last to

**[10:40] SPEAKER_00:** a

**[10:40] SPEAKER_01:** back on

**[10:40] SPEAKER_00:** full

**[10:40] SPEAKER_01:** last

**[10:41] SPEAKER_00:** day , or

**[10:40] SPEAKER_01:** like

**[10:41] SPEAKER_00:** three full days

**[10:41] SPEAKER_01:** ,

**[10:41] SPEAKER_00:** of

**[10:41] SPEAKER_01:** was just sitting there and sucking up all of these , ideas

**[10:46] SPEAKER_00:** full

**[10:52] SPEAKER_00:** day or three full days just sitting there and people presenting all their these ideas , and . I remember clearly , like , was like . was , like , like , it , was did like . coins . amazing , amazing . I think Fabian Vogelsteller and Alex Van Alice van de Sande and some de people I the ERC-20 token standard , or the early Sande of it . which , and this has also become such a big part of Ethereum some . I other people presented the ERC-20 token standard , or the early version interesting it to continue working . this has , or is such a big part of Ethereum now , I think maybe Consensys , I'm not sure , and of course , the people I was working This . also , of is such a now of . I . I Gnosis I'm not sure , And , course . And of course , the a lot project very good feedback as well . so it was it was also I I'm right was working on , the people there , like were presenting the Raiden Network , which got a lot of very good feedback as well . So . it was so HydraChain as well , right ? I . I or three full days of just sitting was and a full day , or three full days of just not there so sold on Hydrachain back the , i remember clearly , like , there was like , a then , was presented , like , i was like , we because it . was it like aimed at Hydrochain . one right of One of the very first permissioned Ethereum . Exactly . It was like a as round-robin kind algorithm . And now it seems like I something people would have used these days . So , only 10 years it was amazing . I think fabian Vogelsteller and Alex Van de Sande and some other people of . And , 10 years too early would have used these days , So , only 10 , early . our conversation , night . Devcon 1 , it was just about the just thinking about that Devcon 1 conversation last night . Devcon 1 was just about the , which . this has also . technology is such a technology part of Ethereum now . i think maybe knosys i'm . sure . and of , the project i was working on Like the people there , like , we were presenting , Like radon Network , got a lot of very good feedback as well . so it was it was I hydrochain as well , right ? think . i maybe there were three booths or something like that , right . A couple of stickers . Like , I barely remember . I just remember , App . project what was the name of the project ? App . Strato . BlockApps . I . BlockApps ? Strato , BlockApps . I remember they had like booth they I think . had a small booth , I think , some stickers . Very small Block , I think . Right , right ? stickers . not so sold on hydrogen back then because it was like at permissioned Ethereum . One of the very first permissioned Ethereums . Exactly . It was like aimed , I think , right , stickers , Very sad that I lost . sticker . Right But , used Ethereum . Exactly . App it . like a round , robin kind what of what , was , algorithm the very name and

**[12:08] SPEAKER_01:** of

**[12:08] SPEAKER_00:** now

**[12:08] SPEAKER_01:** the

**[12:08] SPEAKER_00:** it seems like

**[12:08] SPEAKER_01:** .

**[12:09] SPEAKER_00:** was just

**[12:08] SPEAKER_01:** project

**[12:09] SPEAKER_00:** about

**[12:09] SPEAKER_01:** block

**[12:09] SPEAKER_00:** the technology .

**[12:09] SPEAKER_01:** block

**[12:10] SPEAKER_00:** sad

**[12:09] SPEAKER_01:** App

**[12:10] SPEAKER_00:** days .

**[12:09] SPEAKER_01:** ?

**[12:10] SPEAKER_00:** so

**[12:10] SPEAKER_01:** Strato

**[12:10] SPEAKER_00:** only

**[12:10] SPEAKER_01:** .

**[12:10] SPEAKER_00:** 10 years ,

**[12:10] SPEAKER_01:** , block

**[12:10] SPEAKER_00:** , too

**[12:10] SPEAKER_01:** block

**[12:11] SPEAKER_00:** early

**[12:11] SPEAKER_01:** that

**[12:11] SPEAKER_00:** . like

**[12:11] SPEAKER_01:** remember

**[12:11] SPEAKER_00:** a

**[12:11] SPEAKER_01:** they

**[12:11] SPEAKER_00:** but back

**[12:11] SPEAKER_01:** had

**[12:11] SPEAKER_00:** to like to a defcon one i small , booth thinking I , it i after our booth conversation last . night that defcon one it ,

**[12:13] SPEAKER_01:** lost

**[12:13] SPEAKER_00:** just , about right the . the some technology stickers . i think maybe there were , three that or something . like that very , right sad . i lost sticker Some . Right . stickers ,

**[12:17] SPEAKER_01:** ,

**[12:18] SPEAKER_00:** . . Very sad that lost I sticker lost Right that But sticker But , other than that , it was just like . people , There was stage and everyone was in the same room . same , the yes . the . the , in the , people would . But there was not a single go event . There was not a go party out It was just dinners and a couple of shepherd's , somewhere . out that was kind of fun go Like out for dinner maybe . But there was not a single side event . shepherd's There pies somewhere . Right . really was that was not kind of fun , Like a single party just the golden days . I , like , really . it was And , it was . I golden days . was , people and ideas and people only talked and ideas and people only talked a tech . I think there was , like , one a little bit weird product a , hype , just talk with a guy who had a T-shirt gun on the stage . This like free my bunk . right dinners and couple of dinners shepherd's pies somewhere . Right , a that was kind of fun . Like , you got to know people really , really well . And , I really just the golden days . I felt like there were so many inspired people and ideas , and people only talked about tech . I think there was like one a little bit weird product think talk with a guy who had a T-shirt gun on the stage this . Free My Bunk . there was in the same was . And in single the evenings , hype talk with a guy who had a t-shirt gun on the stage . maybe . But there was not a Who Free My Bunk . Who had like a different energy than everybody else . It felt like he was the only one who knew how to give a talk and how to sell . And back then I

**[12:50] SPEAKER_00:** very different event energy than everybody else . It felt like he was the only one who knew how to hype talk with a guy who had a T-shirt gun on the stage this Free my bank guy who had a very different energy than everybody else . It felt like he was the only one who knew how to give a talk and how to sell . Back then I thought it was way too more yes , and in the evenings , people would go out , go out for dinner maybe . but there a only one who knew how . It a talk and how to was . much . But . was . give . it's to what everyone . And . That's was . And the quality And slides . as well . It's right to look back . but , and I was about that and then I was comparing with . I , let's Devcon , Devcon 2 . I think I was at Devcon 2 there pies somewhere . And was that was kind of fun . You got maybe know people really , maybe really well . It was really just like golden days . I like felt like there were so many inspired a and ideas and people a only talked couple tech . of think there couple parties . I one think ConsenSys had like a , bar somewhere with a guy who had a T-shirt gun on the stage . This like Free where Bank guy who had like i think we was , like , one a little would parties usually go . It was still not that . Only one stage I that big . Only one I think ConsenSys had like at Devcon 2 just a , bar somewhere where we , hype , talk with a guy who had a we would usually go . It was still not that big . like free my bunk . Right . who had like a very different energy than everybody . else it felt . he was the only one who knew how to give a talk and how had like sell a back . then bar thought it somewhere way too where . we now would it's usually everyone go is that's . and the It of slides was so was as still not that big . only one only one , stage was thinking about that stage , I think at Devcon 2 . There was just one main stage one . main , stage doable . . and then I And then I with let's say defcon 2 think at Devcon 3 in Cancun , that was where you could really feel , now there's a lot of money in this space because like there were parties right and left . And , the , is history , right ? well of been quite crazy to see this development as well : measuring , on the amount of events and parties at the different Devcons , how popular things got . But absolutely : for me , Devcon 1 is one of my best memories of these 10 years simply because it was just so measuring and motivating on And the amount of events and parties at the different DevCons , how popular things got . But absolutely . for me , Devcon me , is Devcon 1 is like one of my of my best memories 10 of big these , 10 only one years i simply at defcon because . there it just one was stage . quite just quite doable . so , and then inspiring think at defcon and in Cancun motivating that was where . could really I , now there's a lot of money in this space because would there were parties right and just . and say . the rest so history , right ? that's . inspiring been quite crazy to see this development as And motivating .
