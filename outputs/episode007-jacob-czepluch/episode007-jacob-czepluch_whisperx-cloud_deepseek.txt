SPEAKER_01: So, hello, hello, Bob. Um, so yes, I'm Bob Summerwill, recording here at DevCon Prague for Early Days of Ethereum. And I have here Jakob. Good enough, good enough. Yes, there you go. So, yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now. I think we did meet in Bogota for DevCon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself. I was not aware of your background and role, but yeah, specifically, you were an intern at Devcon in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended DevCon 1. So, how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, thank you for the intro and good question. Yeah, it was in Bogota. I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then. But yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about Florian Glatz maybe, and talking about the old days. And I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum. And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client back starting September or August 2015. I think it was like maybe August to December. It was a couple of weeks after Frontier launched. And the first week I was there was when there was like the first big fork where the Go client forked from the C++ and Python client. There was a chain split on mainnet, yes. And it happened I think the second day I was there. And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office. So everything was extremely chaotic, and people arrived at the office for the meetup, and nothing happened for a good amount of time. And eventually, I was just sitting there in the corner working, and I was like, no, we can't do this because there's so many people who are just looking, some started leaving. So I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I had given a couple of weeks before back in Copenhagen and prior to my internship. Yeah, I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group. Oh goodness. So, when do you think that started? I know exactly when it started. It started on the 14th of July 2015. Right. And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science, okay, and I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

SPEAKER_01: So, this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate? It was actually an internship.

SPEAKER_00: That I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015. 2015. So you had graduated? Yeah, but just a bachelor, right? And because the ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then, right, right. I mean, I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 right to like the C++ client or something like that. Okay. So, yeah, I actually think I've known of Ethereum since the end of 2014. Anyway, yeah, we wrote this bachelor thesis, me and two of my friends, and we shared it with the foundation, and then we got offered internships. Right. And I was the only one like I was tired of studying already only after a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue. So, I was like, okay, I'm going to do this. And a couple weeks later, I moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client. Right, right. And yeah, that was a very interesting time. Like, thinking back now, I'm sad I didn't write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit more. But I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are. Right. Yeah, but yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

SPEAKER_01: So, I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right? But also Felix Lange, I know, was there on the guest team, yeah, and then some different people.

SPEAKER_00: And then some Python, Simon Jentzsch, I think he was doing Ghost stuff. And yeah, the Solidity team was also there. I think they were under the C++ team, that's right. Yeah, but they were there, and Remix as well, well Mix, sorry, at the time. Yeah, yeah. And I also remember Mist. I guess at least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around. So there was a good amount of different people around. And also quite often, people would come and visit from other places. I remember a couple of times Christoph Jentzsch came to visit. Yeah, there was one time where I think he arrived at midnight or something like that, and there was no one else at the office. Yeah, I was doing my internship, and I think he wrote late afternoon on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever. Right, right. So, I was just like, oh, it's fine. I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway. I had like the smallest room, just a small room with a bed, nothing else basically. Yeah, so I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office, and I actually had, I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice. Right, right. So, yeah, I had one night where I think I left him into the office at midnight, and we had a little bit of a chat. I got to know him. Right, he told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing. Right, it was quite interesting. And that's cross-client testing as well, wasn't it? Right, yeah, if I remember correctly, like he was building a lot of JSON data that they fit to the client, and that was from the C++ client. I know that Cpp-Ethereum was leading, and the tests were generated from that but then running those against the Python and Geth clients probably. Yeah, that sounds about right. But yeah, I have there are a lot of small stories though. Like, we don't have too much time, and I'll try to keep it short. But yeah, I would say if I think back to like the most interesting things that happened, it was like, of course, being lucky enough to participate at DevCon 1. Right, yeah, and also experience the kind of split that was taking place at this point in time because the foundation I think almost ran out of money. And yeah, that's right, the C++ team was kind of cut off.

SPEAKER_01: So, you also had Ming Chan, her first official date was the first of August of 2015. So, yeah, you basically have those kind of cost-cutting measures coming in quite fast of looking at the spend where it had been going for a year. It was the July of the previous year that the foundation had been formed, and you had the crowdsale, but like nearly all of the money was gone. Yeah, I think that was also maybe not the most responsible usage of money. But also, the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly. Yeah, that's right. The Ether price itself was also dipping below the pre-sale price at some point, and it's right like September year in, and you've had no accumulation. Yeah, um, but yeah, I didn't have any interactions with Ming back then. So, maybe actually one thing I just remembered now is I was actually supposed to have done my internship on the C++ team in London, but oh yeah, right, a couple of weeks before that, I was told, sorry, we can't do it anyway because we don't have the money anymore.

SPEAKER_01: Right, well, because they were getting very rapidly the funding or even shut down entirely, I think.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, probably already or that was coming. Yeah, so that's why it ended up being the Python team instead because there was some budget. But yeah, like sitting as the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner, I had a lot of fun following how people came and went into Gavin's office and had a chat there with him and Utah or whatever. And I didn't really know in the beginning what was going on until I was also asked if I wanted to come in and talk, and it was basically presenting ideas of what would happen next with the C++ team and to consider joining there or whatever.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so that was sort of the pre-formation of what became f-core later, Parity, yeah, I think so.

SPEAKER_00: So, I was witnessing that without knowing what was going on. Yeah, I had no insight into the finances of the foundation or anything like that. I only found out about most of those things later.

SPEAKER_01: Um, but so yeah, I mean, maybe interesting to see, yeah. So, I mean, let's maybe talk about DevCon 1. So, you had this, so the first DevCon was DevCon zero, which happened in November 2014 before your time, which was the closed event mainly Ethereum Foundation people but some broader ecosystem people. But then DevCon 1 happened in November 2015 in London. It had got announced early in the year and got canceled because of this funding squeeze, but then Consensus basically stepped up and filled that funding gap and did some organizing. So, that was in November of that year. I was not present myself that I couldn't afford to go or whatever at the time, but I watched a lot of the livestream, but you know, that was a really very seminal conference. So, how was that?

SPEAKER_00: It was for me, it was amazing. Like, I've never been good at sitting still on a chair for a long period of time, but there I was at every talk from the beginning in the morning until the end. I think I missed one talk because I had to go catch my flight to go back on the last day, but it was, I was just sitting there and sucking up all of these ideas and visions, and it was really, I think before that, I had an idea that I thought it would be interesting to continue working with Ethereum or in the Ethereum space, but after DevCon 1, I was like, I have to do this. There's no other way for me. I'm not going back to the university. I'm not going to do anything else. This is what I'm going to do because it was a full day or three full days of just sitting there and people presenting their ideas. I remember clearly like Maker was presented, and I was like, okay, we did like stablecoins. It was amazing. I think Fabian Vogelsteller and Alice van de Sande and some other people presented the ERC-20 token standard or the early version of it, which, yeah, okay, this has also become such a big part of Ethereum now. I think maybe Knoxis, I'm not sure actually. And of course, the project I was working on, the people there, we were presenting the Raiden Network, which got a lot of very good feedback as well. So, it was so Hydrochain as well. Right, yeah, I was not so sold on Hydrochain back then because it was aimed at like, yeah, one of the very first permissioned Ethereum exactly. It was like a round-robin kind of algorithm, and now it seems like something people would actually have used these days, so yeah, only 10 years too early. But back to DevCon 1, I was just thinking about it after our conversation last night that DevCon 1 was just about the technology. I think maybe there were three booths or something like that, right, a couple of stickers like I barely remember, I just remember, yeah, BlockApps, what was the name of the project, BlockApps Strato, yeah BlockApps, I remember they had like a small booth. Right, some stickers, yeah, very sad that I lost that sticker, but um, other than that, it was just like, yeah, just people, there was one stage and everyone was like in the same room, and in the evenings, people would go out for dinner maybe, but there was not a single side event. There was not a single party, the glory days, it was just dinners and a couple of shepherd's pies somewhere. And that was kind of fun like you got to know people really well, and yeah, it was really just the golden days. I felt like there was so many inspired people and ideas, and people only talked about tech. I think there was like one a little bit weird product hype talk with a guy who had a T-shirt gun on the stage, this like Free My Bunk, right, who had like a very different energy than everybody else. It felt like he was the only one who actually knew how to give a talk and how to actually sell, and back then I thought it was way too much, but now now it's basically what everyone else is. That's right, and the quality of slides was so bad as well. It's right to look back, but yeah, I was thinking about that and then I was comparing with let's say DevCon 2. Right, I think at DevCon 2 there was maybe a couple of parties, I think Consensus had like a bar somewhere where we would usually go, it was still not that big, yeah, only one stage, I think at DevCon 2 there was just one main stage, quite doable, and then I think at DevCon three in Cancun, that was where you could really feel okay now there's a lot of money in this space because there were parties right and left, and yeah, okay, the rest is history. That's right, it's been quite crazy to see this development as well of measuring on the amount of events and parties at the different DevCons how popular things got, but absolutely, yeah, for me, DevCon 1 is like one of my best memories of these 10 years simply because it was just so inspiring and motivating, I would say, and a lot of the people you have on your list were around there. Yeah, it's quite cool, and I actually recently found out that someone I got to know a couple of years ago only who's also doing some cool stuff, he actually was around there like we didn't meet each other, I didn't know him, I only found out like two years ago, but he had also, and he said he didn't see almost any talks because he was sitting in the back trying to get geth or the Geth client to run on his machine or something like that because it was not easy back then. No, it took days even if you had the devs available next to you. Absolutely, it wasn't easy, no. So, yeah, I think that's mainly what I have to share without going into too much detail about things, but well, thanks so much.

SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay, all the very best, thank you. You too.
