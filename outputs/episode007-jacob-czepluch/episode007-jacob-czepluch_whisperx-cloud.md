**[00:01] SPEAKER_01:** so hello hello bob um so yes i'm bob simul uh recording here at dark prague for early days of ethereum and i have here um yakub good enough good enough yes there you go so so yeah we've known each other about three years or so now um i think we we did meet in uh in bogota for devcon six for the first time uh where you introduced yourself i was not aware of uh of of your background and role but uh but yeah specifically i uh you were an intern at dev um in berlin in late 2015 and you also attended defcon one so how how did you come to be involved with ethereum at that

**[00:54] SPEAKER_00:** time oh yeah thank you for the intro and good question yeah it was in bogota i i think i knew about you or of you for longer than since then but um yeah i think uh you were chatting with uh someone and talking about florian glatz maybe and talking about the old days and right and i just jumped in because i know thorian and found out that we have a shared interest in in the old days of ethereum um and yeah i did my my internship uh working on the python client back uh starting september or august uh 2015 i think it was like maybe august to december yeah it was august to december it was a couple of weeks after minute launched and the first week i was there was when there was like the first uh big fork where the go client uh forked from the um c plus plus and python client there was a chain split on mainnet yes um and it happened i think the second day i was there um and that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the uh in the office right um so everything was extremely chaotic and people arrived at the office uh for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time uh and eventually i was just sitting there in the corner working and i was like no we can't do this because there's so many people who are just like looking some started leaving so i i kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation of on ethereum back then uh that i had given uh a couple of weeks before back in in copenhagen and prior to your internship yeah i gave the presentation prior to my internship because i started a copenhagen ethereum meetup group oh goodness so when when do you think that started i know exactly when it started it started on the 14th of july 2015. right right and the reason i got into ethereum uh was i was studying computer science okay and i knew about bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on bitcoin

**[02:52] SPEAKER_01:** so this was an internship while you were still doing uh an undergraduate it was actually an internship

**[02:56] SPEAKER_00:** that i got because i wrote my bachelor thesis on ethereum oh in the spring of 2015. 2015. so you had graduated yeah but just a bachelor right and because the ecosystem so to speak was so small back then right right um i um we were in contact with the ethereum foundation during the internship like right right i mean i think i opened my first issue in march 2015 right to like the c plus client or something like that okay um so so yeah i actually i think the the i've known of ethereum since end of 2014 but anyway yeah yeah um we wrote this bachelor thesis me and two uh two two of my uh um my friends and we sent we shared it with the foundation and then we got offered internships right and i was the only one like i was tired of studying already only after a bachelor and the other two guys wanted to continue so i was like okay i'm gonna i'm gonna do this um and a couple weeks later i moved to uh to berlin to to do my internship working on the on the python client right right um and yeah that was a very interesting time like thinking back now i'm sad i didn't write down more things or right to take more pictures or appreciate some of the the things a little bit more but i also had no idea that things would get as big as they as they are right yeah but yeah i i enjoyed

**[04:22] SPEAKER_01:** it a lot um so i mean it was primarily c plus plus development under gav that was that was happening in that office right but but also felix lang i know was there on the guest team yeah and then some

**[04:33] SPEAKER_00:** different people and then some python simonson i think he was doing ghost stuff um um and yeah the solidity team was also there i think they were under the c plus plus team that's right yeah but they were there and remix as well well mix sorry at the time yeah yeah um and i also remember the mist i guess at least fabian focus was also around so there was a good amount of different yeah um people around um and also quite often people would come and visit from yeah like other places i remember a couple of times christoph jens uh came to visit yeah there was one time where i think he arrived at midnight or something like that and there were no one else at the office yeah i was doing my internship and i think he wrote like late afternoon he wrote on the the skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever right right so i was just like oh it's it's fine i have i had nothing to do in berlin anyway i had like the smallest room just like a small room with a bed nothing else basically yeah so i i enjoyed uh spending a lot of time in the office and i actually had like i would i would usually just stay in the office uh yeah and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice right right so yeah i had one night one night where i think i left let him into the office at uh at midnight and we had uh had a little bit of a chat i got to know him right he told me about all the the testing he was doing and how they were testing right it was quite quite interesting and that's cross client testing as well wasn't it right yeah if i remember correctly like he was building a lot of uh like just json data that they

**[06:10] SPEAKER_01:** fit to the client and that was from the c plus plus client i know that that that cpp ethereum was leading and the tests were generated from that but then running those against the python and uh and geth

**[06:22] SPEAKER_00:** clients probably yeah that sounds uh sounds about right but yeah i have there are a lot of small stories uh though like we you told me we don't have too much time and i'll try to keep it short but yeah um i would say if i think back to like the most interesting things that happened it was like of course being lucky enough to participate at defcon one right yeah and also experience the kind of split uh that that was taking place at this point in time because the foundation i think almost ran out of money and yeah that's right the c plus plus team was kind of uh cut off and you also

**[07:04] SPEAKER_01:** so you also had uh you know ming chan her first official date was first of august uh of of 2015 so yeah you basically have those kind of cost cutting measures coming in quite fast of looking at the spend where you know it had been going for a year it was it was the july of the previous year that the foundation had been formed and you had the crowd sale but like nearly all of

**[07:28] SPEAKER_00:** the money was gone yeah i think that was also maybe not the most responsible uh like uh usage of money but also the bitcoin price was doing really poorly yeah that's right the ether price itself was also yeah i think it dipped uh below uh the the the the pre-sale price at some point and it's right like september year in and you've had no accumulation yeah um but yeah i didn't have any interactions with no with ming back back then um so maybe actually one thing i just remembered now i was actually supposed to have done my internship on the c plus plus team in london but oh yeah right yeah a couple of weeks before that i was uh told sorry we can't do it anyway because like we don't have the money anymore

**[08:12] SPEAKER_01:** right well because they they were getting very rapidly the funding or even even shut down entirely i

**[08:17] SPEAKER_00:** think yeah probably already or that was coming um yeah so that's why it ended up being the the python team instead because there was uh some budget um but yeah like sitting as the only person working on the python client in in that office in in my small corner uh i had a lot of fun kind of uh following how people came and went and went into gavin's office and had a chat there with him and utah or whatever and i didn't really know in the beginning what was going on until i i was also asked if i if they i wanted to to come in and and talk and it was basically like um presenting ideas of like what would happen next with with the c plus plus team and right to consider uh joining there or whatever

**[09:06] SPEAKER_01:** yeah so that was sort of the the pre pre formation of what became f core later parity yeah i i think so

**[09:18] SPEAKER_00:** that so i i was witnessing that without knowing what was going on yeah i had no insight into like the finances of of the foundation or anything like that i only found out about most of those things um later

**[09:32] SPEAKER_01:** um but so yeah i mean maybe interesting to see yeah yeah so i mean let maybe let's let's talk about devcon ones so um you'd have this so the first devcon was devcon zero uh which happened in november 2014 before your time which was the the closed uh you know closed event mainly ethereum foundation people but some broader ecosystem people but then devcon one happened in november 2015 um in london um it had got announced early in the year and got cancelled because of this funding squeeze but then uh consensus basically stepped up and filled that funding gap and and did some organizing so that was in november of that year i i was not present myself that i i couldn't afford to go or whatever at the time but i watched a lot of the limestream but you know that was a really very seminal uh uh conference so how how was that

**[10:34] SPEAKER_00:** it was for me it was amazing like i i've never been good at like sitting still on a chair for a long period of time but there i was at every talk from the beginning in the morning until the end i think i missed one talk because i had to go catch my flight to to go back on the last day or like but it was i was just sitting there and sucking up all of these uh ideas and visions and it was really i think before that i i had an idea that i thought it would be interesting to continue working with with ethereum or in the ethereum space but after defcon one i was like i have to do this like there's no other way for me i'm not going back to the university i'm not going to do anything else this is what i'm i'm gonna do because it was a full day or three full days of just sitting there and people presenting their ideas uh i remember clearly like there was like a maker was presented like i was like okay we did like stable coins like it was amazing uh i think fabian and focus stella and alice van der sande and some other people presented the erc20 token standard or the early version of it um which yeah okay this has also this is such a big part of ethereum now um i think maybe knosys i'm not sure actually um and of course the the project i was working on the people there like we were presenting uh the radon network which got a lot of very good feedback as well um so it was it was so hydrochain as well right yeah i was not so sold on hydrogen back then because it was like aimed at at like um yeah um one of the very first uh permissioned ethereum exactly it was like a round robin kind of uh algorithm uh and now it seems like something people would actually have used uh these days so yeah only 10 years uh too early um but back to to to defcon one i was just thinking about it after our conversation last night yeah that defcon one it was just about the the technology like i think maybe there were three booths or something like that right a couple of stickers like i barely remember i just remember yeah uh app uh what what was the name of the project block uh block app strato yeah block block i remember they had like a small booth i think uh right right some stickers uh yeah very sad that i lost that sticker right but uh um other than that it was just like yeah just people there was one stage and everyone was like in the same room uh more yes um and in the evenings yeah people would go out go out for dinner maybe but there was not a single side event there was not a single party glory days it was just dinners and a couple of shepherd's pies somewhere right um and that was kind of fun like you you got to know people uh like really really well and um yeah it was it was really just the golden days i felt like there was yeah so many inspired people and ideas and people only talked about tech i think there was like one a little bit weird product uh hype uh talk with a guy who had a t-shirt uh gun on the stage this like free my bunk uh right who had like a very different energy than everybody else it felt like he was the only one who actually knew how to give a talk and how to actually sell and back then i thought it was way too much but now now it's basically what everyone else is that's right and the quality of slides was so bad as well it's right to look back um but yeah i was thinking about that and then i was comparing with let's say defcon 2. right i think at defcon 2 there was maybe like a couple of parties i think uh consensus had like a yeah bar somewhere where we would usually go it was still not that big uh yeah only one stage i think at defcon 2 there was just one main stage yeah quite quite doable um and then i think at defcon three in cancun that was where you could really feel okay now there's a lot of money in this space because like there were parties right and left um and yeah okay the rest is history right that's right it's been quite crazy to see this development as well of like measuring on the amount of events and parties at the different uh defcons how how popular um things got but absolutely yeah for for me the the defcon one is like one of my best memories of these uh 10 years simply because it was just so inspiring and and motivating i would say and a lot of the people you have on your list were around there like yeah yeah it's it's quite quite cool and i actually recently found out um that someone i got to know or a couple of years ago only um who's also doing some cool um stuff he actually was around there like we didn't meet each other i didn't know him i only found out like two years ago but he had also and he said he didn't see almost any talks because he was sitting in the back trying to get uh ls0 or the get client to run on his machine or something like that because it was not easy back then no no it took days even if you had the devs available right next to you absolutely it wasn't easy no um so yeah i think that's mainly what i have to like share without it going into too much detail about about things but well thanks so much yeah you're very welcome great chatting always yeah

**[15:50] SPEAKER_01:** okay okay all the very best thank you you too
