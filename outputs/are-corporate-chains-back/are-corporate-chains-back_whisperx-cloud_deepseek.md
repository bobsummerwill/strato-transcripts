**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** The stream is live. The stream is live. Don't cross the streams. Who are you gonna call? You see what happens to the audio when you cross the streams. Yes, exactly. Okay. We seem to be also live on X. So welcome everyone to another Group chat by the Mutual Support Group chat. Mutual Support Group, yeah. Yes, exactly. With the builders from Strava Mercada, I'm Victor Wong. I am founder and chief product officer at Strava Mercada. Bob, who are you?

**[00:50] SPEAKER_03:** Kieran James Lubin, CEO, once a coder, long time off. Code a little again. The vibe coding era has been great for making an occasional fix here and there.

**[01:07] SPEAKER_04:** But soon we'll be back just doing commercial stuff. Yeah. I was playing around with the OpenAI browser today, and it was kind of miraculous just telling it to do stuff and seeing the cursor move around all by itself. Both miraculous and disturbing. It moves really slow. It does. It takes time to do stuff. But you just kind of keep it running in the background. Anyways, today's topic, getting us back to the topic at hand, is basically our corporate chain's back. And we obviously have some intimate knowledge about this, having been part of the rise and perhaps fall and maybe the rise again of corporate chains. Hey Lewis, nice to have you. But maybe you can, maybe Bob, you can give us an outline of the new corporate chains as they're called, like what's kind of happening currently and then we can kind of look back over the history of corporate chains.

**[02:21] SPEAKER_01:** The red hot action at the moment is really about Tempo. So Tempo was announced on September the 4th by Stripe and a consortium that they got together, which just reading initial members as well as Stripe themselves, including Anthropic, Coupang, I don't know who those are, I'm not going to say all these Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Mercury Bank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, and Visa. So yeah, I mean, you got Shopify and Visa, you know, you're doing pretty well on that payment side. And yeah, I mean, I guess especially where a lot of this tension has come in on the Ethereum side is, you know, this is going to be another EVM chain. So it's kind of like, thanks for the work, guys. We'll do a corporate version now. And, you know, so specifically Paradigm are a big part of this. Now, Paradigm have spent the last few years kind of building up Ethereum stack stuff, you know, kind of being semi well-behaved participants within the Ethereum ecosystem, caveat a few VC nasty moments, but essentially building a, you know, hey, we've built a really good new Rust client, right? We do some of the best tooling with Foundry, right? You know, what you had going on in earlier years, right? We've made a better one. And I think there's about three or four areas where they built sort of Ethereum stack stuff, almost like, hey, here's a full stack Ethereum stack. Oh, but actually we're going over that to like, we've got the answer and we can just like do a new chain deployment and off we go. So, yeah, that's not been received terribly well. Also, big brain drain, you know, that they are snuffling up a good number of fairly high profile people. Dankrad Feist, one of the main Ethereum researchers, key guy behind the proof of stake transition, years at work, you know, him as a primary guy and he's off to get his paycheck, fair play to him. You know, a number of other people as well. But that's been the current fire as Guati Guat said, this is like if Greta went to work for BP.

**[05:22] SPEAKER_04:** Well, and to be clear also, I think we've been talking about Tempo, but they're not the only corporate chain. Like, you know, obviously Robinhood is launching an L2 on Arbitrum. I think it's an L1.

**[05:39] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, I don't know if it's an L2 or an L1. They've sort of talked about various bits on that. Circle announced ARK. Yeah. They're not content to be a smart, sorry, a stablecoin on other chains. It's like, right, we're gonna do our own chain as well. I mean, Base, you know, the whole Base thing from Coinbase, again, um, you know, they haven't had a token, but you know, there's your straight path into Coinbase has a chain or soon. I think they announced something. Maybe. I mean, they started out before Ethereum stuff was going, right? So there's an Omni that was previously Mastercoin, super ancient tech, 2013 era. But then they later moved to Ethereum and many other chains. But yeah, like having their own totally is something that makes sense. And I mean, you've had Binance chain, you know, BNB for years. Pretty much every major exchange seems to have their own chain now. Uniswap has its chain.

**[06:53] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, Uniswap has a chain. But I don't think of those as corporate chains. It's hard to tell, right? Is it for us, by us? Somehow I see the Stripe chain as the incursion of the establishment into our crypto turf, where it's like... and I kind of see Base that way a little bit where I feel somehow less bad about Binance chain even though Coinbase in some ways like a better actor than Binance. But very much Coinbase just feels like part of the old thing to me. Whereas I mean these lines are quite arbitrary.

**[07:38] SPEAKER_01:** You know, there were various discussions I saw as well this week about Ethereum alignment. You know, what does that even mean? It's like, so these guys, they're Ethereum aligned, so it's okay. I think what it means, I mean, it's a strange thing that's going on in which, let's take it to Bitcoin for a second.

**[08:04] SPEAKER_03:** I've been critical, at least privately, maybe publicly, of the Maxi mentality in which there will only be Bitcoin. There's only one sincere crypto asset. Everything after is a scam. And we should all put our energy into Bitcoin, but also never really add anything to Bitcoin. Maybe very slowly add small things around the margin.

**[08:40] SPEAKER_04:** It's got to stay secure. We believe in open markets, but this should be the only market. There should only ultimately be a single market. It's very hypocritical as well for libertarian types.

**[08:59] SPEAKER_03:** It's like no no this is all about freedom from the man right yeah you can't tell me what to do permission has changed yeah but not like that everything here just in this one approved location yeah so I think it's a little bit a repeat of that phenomenon I mean I get it also kind of a believer in the more permissive open source software licensing. At the same time, maybe Linux was right as far as GPL sort of forcing the commercial efforts to crew back one place and you know the BSDs survive basically with OS 10 to some extent you know and perhaps maybe it out competed because it had a benevolent dictator genius, but maybe it out-competed in part because of the virality of the license. And this is not to say, I think there's a mix of licensing regimes. I know you've worked on this very directly, Bob, for the Ethereum software, some of it permissive, some not. But it sort of part of it's also like a lot of the Ethereum people did well enough to either launch the next thing on Ethereum or launch the next thing not on Ethereum and didn't really have any need for a job per se at some point. And so you would expect something new to come and maybe try to cannibalize the old thing. It's a strange sort of religiosity also. And I think we experienced it even in like back in 2015, even like any deviation from Ethereum principles was looked askance. Well, maybe that's sort of a good transition.

**[11:01] SPEAKER_04:** You know, we as Blockups and Strato went in with the Haskell implementation of Ethereum, went in a corporate chain direction. Maybe you can talk about why we did that. So we may be partly to blame for this. Partly to blame. And it was barely on purpose. So rolling back in 2017,

**[11:30] SPEAKER_03:** say late 2014, our CTO Jim and I, mostly Jim, started working on the Haskell implementation of Ethereum and he pretty quickly got it to the point where it could sync the test net. And there were some chat groups, a Slack, there was a bit of the yellow paper I guess was out at that time.

**[11:53] SPEAKER_01:** I found an exact date for this, actually. So Jim's first commit was mid-September 2014. The yellow paper had been out about April. Really? Yeah. Gotcha.

**[12:08] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah and he might have been working on it for a while before he pushed anything. I think I would have gotten back so we met up, we got introduced by previous co-founder of Jim's who I had reached out to when I started working on Ethereum and we probably spoke the first time June July something like that and we met up in Berkeley, probably the first time, maybe August or September or thereabouts. By the way, since then, Jim continues to have a habit of building a full client to try to understand a piece of blockchain software. At some point, we were looking into the state of zero knowledge proofs, and he built a, I believe, full syncing Zcash client. It's definitely missing some features, but we still have that somewhere. As you do. As you do, yeah. As one does. So yeah, we should revisit this at some later date. So yeah, so we met up. He started coding, and it got to the point of functional and syncing with the fairly primitive early test nets pretty quickly. And we didn't quite intend to turn it into a business right at the beginning, but the three of us, that's Victor, Jim, and I, met up on January 2015 had a bunch of conferences that I've done. I've spoken about at other times. We can link people to the early days of Ethereum, one perhaps that helped kind of galvanize the effort. But I think what we had was always like a pragmatic attitude. And so shortly after that, one of the first things we built, we found like the API interaction style to be a little odd, like the JSON RPC, the Web3 library. We're kind of like all other APIs are like this, where this is a REST API. We were kind of looking at chain.com. I think chain actually sponsored the conference that we did or spoke or something. And it was a good talk where it was like, well, we've got these 20 great use cases that people are doing out there in the world. Oh, and they're all on chain. Chain also fairly soon after that seemed to go a corporate chain direction. Was that sort of like a UTXO Bitcoin-like? I assume so, yeah. I think they probably either forked one of the Bitcoin clients or maybe they started from scratch. But first, definitely, they were trying to be the Bitcoin developer API. It just didn't feel like there was enough demand at that time. And I assume, like us, it was a strange period where you actually got pretty active corporate inbound. Like sometime in 2015 and then later into 2016, it was very common for corporate innovation labs to be running some kind of blockchain tech, usually an Ethereum variant. And they were very explicit. And maybe it's sort of like the early cloud days, like, we want that thing you've got, but can you just get it on-prem? Like, can you just like, we want the ledger, we'd want to know who the parties are. You can't just let anyone in here. We're regulated. We want it, though. We really want it. We like this API you've got. Give it to us. We've got transactions to settle right now with our suppliers. And it all went way slower than that. But it was like the market was actually like screaming at you for a minute there in a way that the world feels much different now. Like, I think it is certainly true that in the 70s or 80s or whatever, it was common for the Department of Defense or some giant bank or something to be your first customer. And much later, it's sort of more the opposite, that you'd get bottoms-up devs, small companies first, and then later, really big guys. And it was sort of a strange mix. I think there's like a barbell effect where really big companies have a lot of excess cash to investigate new technologies and then you get startups and that was the feeling and we would get the inbound from those really big companies. I think that even that era, I bet they're all doing AI now and maybe that adoption is going pretty.

**[17:13] SPEAKER_04:** It's probably mixed, but there was a moment there where it was like screaming urgent demand. Yeah, and I would say part of that also is like when we launched blockchain as a service with Microsoft and we made it easy to effectively build your own testnets on clouds, everyone started doing it, right? Yes. And the interesting thing is at that time, the real development seemed to be happening by these corporates in these innovation labs versus independent labs.

**[17:45] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, that's right. It felt like, okay, they would come to you with like a PowerPoint describing the billion plus dollar problem that they had. This is after all the NDAs were signed and all that sort of thing. This was like very convincing. It was like, you know, some of the use cases were bad, but a lot of them are like, oh, okay, like you have some really complicated multi-organization settlement problem that you handle with spreadsheets or some ancient system and it costs a ton of money and if you actually could upgrade it it would be way better potentially and the vast majority of those did not work out but it wasn't like they identified the wrong problem it was like the will to implement across a corporation or multiple corporations. The big consortium era was probably the issue and to some extent I know we want to talk a little bit about Libra, regulatory barriers as well in certain cases. So again, we at first started to be wanted to be just like the public net API, like Alchemy or an inferior now. And I think we're just a little early for that. And then also we're going to the effort of maintaining a whole client, which was challenging because things kept changing as they continue to do.

**[19:08] SPEAKER_04:** But got very much pulled in this like, let's run our own network direction by the corporates. And I think part of it was at that early time, they couldn't hold ETH. So they were like, we want to do all these things, but we can't hold ETH. Can you make a version where we don't need to do it to do all these things?

**[19:25] SPEAKER_03:** I totally forgot. It was like, Treasury doesn't know what to do. It's $20. No, we've got our procedures. It has to get in the ERP. We can't have a line item for that. I remember.

**[19:44] SPEAKER_01:** I remember with RSDB, who became Monax and so on, they started in 2014 as well when it was still on POC 5 before the mainnet. And there you had a situation of a company being set up by lawyers who really loved the smart contract functionality. But nothing to do with that. It's like F is probably in legal security. Like, we don't want to get anywhere near that. It's like, so it really was the blockchain, not Bitcoin being the phrase at the time, right? The blockchain, not Ethereum, not either. But the one thing that was really interesting, like when we launched that blockchain as a service and it got on Azure, like we had thousands of people spinning up stuff.

**[20:36] SPEAKER_04:** And then a good number of them reaching out to us. And I will say the use cases that didn't seem speculative did come from these corporates. Like, we did get contacted by sort of smaller groups, but they were like, Oh, well, we just want to launch our own token and sell it like that.

**[20:56] SPEAKER_03:** Those are all of those use cases. That came a little later, actually. Once a couple of ICOs had happened, like suddenly everyone wanted to pay someone to build their thing for an ICO. But that was kind of more like 2016 to 2018 phenomenon.

**[21:14] SPEAKER_04:** I would say. Yeah, that's true. The corporates came first, actually. Yeah, exactly. And so, I mean, you know, that was our experience. And shortly afterwards, Bob, you might have the timing, Libra by Facebook came along. And they were doing their own thing. Do you know the time? I think it was 18, 17. Yeah, we launched blockchain as a service in 2015, right? And it's 2015. I'm feeling like it was 2016 that Libra launched. No, it was later, I think. Was it? Okay. Here we go.

**[21:48] SPEAKER_01:** As a resident historian of all things blockchain. There we go. June the 18th, 2019. Oh. I wasn't that late. I was willing. Yeah. At that point, Meta, then Facebook, announced it, which is a stablecoin project intended for global payments via its applications, sorry, via its apps. So what you have there, I mean, the other thing worth saying about Libra is Libra is not an EVM project. You know, they had their I guess, you know, they're like happening like five years later. So it's like, you know, let's apply all of our learnings of what's worked and what has not worked over that five-year period, especially about smart contract security and having a constrained model. Their language seems pretty good to me, actually, but no one uses it. We're stuck with Solidity will be the JavaScript slash COBOL of the crypto age, we're never getting rid of this thing.

**[22:53] SPEAKER_04:** The crypto age, we're never getting rid of this thing. Well, and, you know, like, I think the EVM has become the standard. So like, so like when I talk about tokenomics, I think tokenomics provides you a system where participants can get everything. So, you know, not to go into names of the projects, but we built some very large consortium chains. And then at some point, every single one of those chains said, oh, well, we need data from this source that this group of people have. And then the question is like, well, Why would that group, you know, shippers or whatever, provide that data? And there are always answers like,

**[41:06] SPEAKER_03:** oh, we'll just force them to do it. But it never worked. A big reason, and I guess this is part what I meant by mentality. But yes, the incentive alignment specifically was a huge problem where a lot of the time it's like either one of them wants the thing way more than the others and is willing to pay for it. Or this is like the Walmart, IBM thing that didn't go anywhere. Yeah. Musk as well. Or a bunch of parties have roughly equal interest in the thing, but then like no one really wants to pay for it. It's like it gets treated like a utility like, well, let's pay cost recovery in, you know, and like it's slow. There's not the urgency to get those sort of things done. And in both cases, you have big trouble attracting like the rest of the value chain. Right. And so we concluded you definitely just had to turn the thing on and let them come in as they're ready and you know what one way or another and it's I think it's worked the best in public chains because there's sort of a common token if you will and people are excited about the value of that token rising by the way this goes back to like other than technological deficiencies like why do people decide to stick with Ethereum or do something else. And it's like, what's going to make the most money? Like, Ethereum's got a lot of assets on it. Maybe you can get some of them. Maybe you should just sit there. But, you know, if there's something you're just bumping your head against and you can't quite figure out how to you might have to go leave which which is you know plenty of people have experienced that including yeah and it's true for any real platform like the app stores right everyone you know myself included we built for iOS first because they figured out payment they figured out micro payments really quickly so we could get paid for what we did.

**[43:11] SPEAKER_01:** Are the new round of corporate chains the future or are they DOA based on similar problems? I'll start with Bob on this one. They are not solving the same problems as truly permissionless ecosystems. However, it's not a winner takes all either. So I think maybe the losers here are going to be the banks that they can get their business eaten a lot easier than this can cannibalize Bitcoin or Ethereum.

**[43:41] SPEAKER_03:** Okay. Kieran, your verdict? Good question. DOA or the future? I think we'll get a couple long-lived corporate chains. I agree with that. I think there'll be semi-niche. I mean, I think of Swift as a corporate chain. Yes. DTC corporate chain. They just happen to not be using a blockchain and both of them are sort of trying to. Right. So we're not going to completely get rid of that. I think they won't go huge like and they might actually be like enormous volume, but like I both won't allowed to be allowed to do and probably will never like run a validator on one. I agree also that they're not going to siphon that much value from public chains. I think the tech may be similar back end pipes from your bank account or when Stripe launches bank accounts versus your MetaMask account, but that they're not really gonna be that much intermingling to the two. One will have bearer assets, one largely will not. And the uncensorability is really important at the end of the day. So yeah, I don't think they'll go away. I think it's very... I think the most immediate failure mode on all of these is political. Like if we see a big flip around, they'll get killed again. Where the permissionless chains will maybe suffer in price a little bit, but probably not. But I am surprised that the banks, I mean, they're already trying to rewrite the Genius Act so that Coinbase can stop to prevent Coinbase from offering rewards. And one way or another, the banks are finished either from the fintechs or crypto or both.

**[46:11] SPEAKER_01:** The big ones around and are kind of tech companies anyway, but it is only regulatory capture protecting them at this point. Yeah. I mean, I think it is both because payments is quite different from lots of other things happening on the blockchain side. You know, savings, store of value, dApps. You're not going to run dApps on Tempo. You're not going to save your money in Tempo coin. Right.

**[46:38] SPEAKER_03:** I mean, I agree. There will not be a lot of like DeFi on Tempo, for instance, sort of because of the too closed of environment. You won't get the compositional aspect of things, probably because they won't allow it. Like I think in theory you could, but you won't. Yeah. So my view is that the projects that might succeed in this space have to have two properties. One is they have to be driven by at least mostly one company. I don't think this idea of the bigger names who have all together, like we've experienced this, that just slows everything down to your point of view. A lot of grandstanding legal departments. It sounds good, but operationally it's terrible. But the other thing is that they have to have that sort of community mindset from the start. Like, I think things like BASE and Binance Chain have been able to do this because they brought a Web3 mentality, even though they drove it at first. And so I think the projects that are likely to kind of evolve are those kinds of projects. That would be my prediction. And I guess also because, you know, their customer base are crypto-y people. You know, it's a similar kind of group.

**[47:57] SPEAKER_01:** And they understand those demands, right? Yeah. Tempo will be going for retail. It's going to be normal retail, you know, Apple Pay, Tempo Pay. Yeah.

**[48:07] SPEAKER_04:** You're not going to know you're using Tempo, most likely. I guess the banks could really suffer, or it could be the credit card networks that really suffer. I think the first victim is Swift, really. On that note, I'll give a quick preview to everyone. Let's wrap up today's conversation. Thank you for joining us. Quick preview for next week. We have Brian, founder of PistachioFi, joining us next week to talk about starting a new project. And his background, actually, he was previously an employee at BlockApp, so we know him very well. So if you want to find us, we're always doing this every week. But if you want to find me, you can find me on X at Vic4Wong. You can find out why it's, I have the form, my name. Bob has posted that on our Telegram. Thanks. Bob, where can people find you if they want to hear more from you?

**[49:07] SPEAKER_03:** So yeah, again, X. So Bob Summerwill. So Summer like the season. Will like write your will. That's me. And Kieran, where can people find you? Also X, K. James Lubin. That's K.
