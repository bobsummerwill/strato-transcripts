SPEAKER_00: The stream is live.

SPEAKER_04: The stream is live.

SPEAKER_00: Don't cross the streams. Who are you going to call? We'll see what happens to the audio when you cross the streets.

SPEAKER_04: Yes, exactly. Okay. We seem to be also live on X. So welcome everyone to another Group chat by the Mutual support group chat.

SPEAKER_00: Mutual support group, yeah.

SPEAKER_04: Yes, exactly. With the builders from Strava Mercada, I'm Victor Wong. I am founder and chief product officer at Strava Mercada. Bob, who are you?

SPEAKER_01: Hello, I'm head of ecosystem.

SPEAKER_04: And Kieren, who are you?

SPEAKER_03: Kieren James Lubin, CEO, once a coder, long time off. Code a little again. Vibe Coding Era has been great for making an occasional fix here and there. But soon we'll be back just doing commercial stuff.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I was playing around with the OpenAI browser today, and it was kind of miraculous just telling it to do stuff and seeing the cursor move around all by itself. Both miraculous and disturbing.

SPEAKER_03: It moves really slow. It does.

SPEAKER_04: It takes time to do stuff. But you just can't keep it running in the background. Anyways, today's topic, getting us back to the topic at hand, is basically our corporate chain's back. And we obviously have some intimate knowledge about this, having been part of the rise and perhaps fall and maybe the rise again of corporate chains. Hey Lewis, nice to have you. But maybe you can, maybe Bob, you can give us an outline of the new corporate chains as they're called, like what's kind of happening currently and then we can kind of look back over the history of corporate chains.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, the red hot action at the moment is really about Tempo. You know, so Tempo was announced on September the 4th by Stripe and a consortium that they got together, which just reading initial members as well as Stripe themselves, including Anthropic, Coupang. I don't know who those are. I'm not going to say all these. Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Mercury Bank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, and Visa. So, yeah, I mean, you got Shopify and Visa. You know, you're doing pretty well on that payment side. Yeah. And yeah, I mean, I guess especially where a lot of this tension has come in. On the Ethereum side, this is going to be another EVM chain. So it's kind of like, thanks for the work, guys. We'll do a corporate version now. And so specifically, Paradigm are a big part of this. Now, Paradigm have spent the last few years kind of building up Ethereum stack stuff, kind of being semi well-behaved participants within the Ethereum ecosystem, carry out a few VC nasty moments, but essentially building a, you know, hey, we've built a really good new Rust client, right? We do some of the best tooling with Foundry, right? You know, what you had going on in earlier years, right, we've made a better one. And I think there's about three or four areas where they built sort of Ethereum stack stuff, almost like, hey, here's a full stack Ethereum stack. Oh, but actually, we're going over that. So like, we've got the answer. And we can just like do a new chain deployment. And off we go. So, yeah, that's not been received terribly well. Also, big brain drain, you know, that they are snuffling up a good number of fairly high profile people. Dankrad Feist, one of the main Ethereum researchers, key guy behind the proof of stake transition, years at work, you know him as a primary guy and he's off to get his paycheck fair play to him a number of other people as well but that that's been the current fire as guati guat said this is like if Greta went to work for BP.

SPEAKER_04: Well, and to be clear also, I think we've been talking about Tempo, but they're not the only corporate chain. Like, you know, obviously Robintor is launching an L2 on Arbitrum.

SPEAKER_01: I think it's an L1. Yeah, so Arbitrum's SPAC. But yeah, I don't know if it's an L2 or an L1. They've sort of talked about various bits on that. Circle announced ARK. They're not content to be a stablecoin on other chains. It's like right we're gonna do our own chain as well. I mean Base, the whole Base thing from Coinbase again, they haven't had a token but there's your straight path into Coinbase. Heather has a chain or soon right.

SPEAKER_03: I think they announced something.

SPEAKER_01: Maybe. I mean, they started out before Ethereum stuff was going right. So there's an Omni that was previously Mastercoin, super ancient tech, 2013 era. But then they later moved to Ethereum and many other chains. But yeah, like having their own totally is something that makes sense. And I mean, you've had Binance chain, BNB, for years. Pretty much every major exchange seems to have their own chain now. Uniswap has its chain.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Uniswap has a chain. But I don't think of those as corporate chains.

SPEAKER_03: It's hard to tell, right? Is it for us, by us? Or is it sort of like, you know, somehow I see the Stripe chain as like the incursion of the establishment into our crypto turf, where it's like... and I kind of see Base that way a little bit where I feel somehow less bad about Binance chain even though Coinbase in some ways like a better actor than Binance but very much Coinbase just feels like part of the old thing to me whereas I mean these lines are quite arbitrary.

SPEAKER_01: You know, there were various discussions I saw as well this week about Ethereum alignment. You know, what does that even mean? It's like, so these guys, they're Ethereum aligned, so it's okay. So it's okay.

SPEAKER_03: I think what it means, I mean, it's a strange thing that's going on in which, let's take it to Bitcoin for a second. I've been critical, at least privately, maybe publicly, of the Maxi mentality in which there will only be Bitcoin. There's only one sincere crypto asset. Everything after is a scam. And we should all put our energy into Bitcoin, but also never really add anything to Bitcoin. Maybe very slowly add small things around the margin.

SPEAKER_04: We believe in open markets, but we should be the only market. There should only ultimately be a single market.

SPEAKER_01: It's very hypocritical as well for libertarian types.

SPEAKER_03: It's like no, no, this is all about freedom from the man. Right? You can't tell me what to do. Permission has changed, but not like that. Everything here just in this one approved location. So I think it's a little bit a repeat of that phenomenon. I mean, I get it also I guess like I'm kind of a believer in the more permissive open source software licensing. At the same time, maybe Linux was right as far as GPL sort of forcing the commercial efforts to crew back one place and you know the BSDs survive basically with OS X to some extent you know and perhaps maybe it out competed because it had a benevolent dictator genius, but maybe it out-competed in part because of the virality of the license. And this is not to say, I think there's a mix of licensing regimes. I know you've worked on this very directly, Bob, for the Ethereum software, some of it permissive, some not. But You know, it's sort of part of it's also like a lot of the Ethereum people did well enough to either launch the next thing on Ethereum or launch the next thing not on Ethereum and didn't really have any need for a job per se at some point. And so you would expect something new to come and maybe try to cannibalize the old thing. It's a strange sort of religiosity also. And I think we experienced it even in back in 2015, even like any deviation from Ethereum principles was looked, looked askance, you know.

SPEAKER_04: Well, maybe that's sort of a good transition. Maybe we can, You know, we as Blockups and Strato went in, you know, with the Haskell implementation of Ethereum, went in a corporate chain direction. Maybe, like, you can talk about why we did that. Indeed. So we may be partly to blame for this.

SPEAKER_03: Partly to blame. You know, it was barely on purpose. So rolling back in 2018, Let's say late 2014, our CTO Jim and I, mostly Jim, started working on the Haskell implementation of Ethereum. And he pretty quickly got it to the point where it could like sync the testnet, you know, and there were some chat groups, a Slack. There was a bit of the yellow paper, I guess, was out at that time.

SPEAKER_01: I found an exact date for this, actually. So Jim's first commit was mid-September 2014. The yellow paper had been out about April. Really? Yeah. Gotcha.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and he might have been working on it for a while before he pushed anything. I think I would have gotten back. So we met up, we got introduced by previous co-founder of Jim's, who I had reached out to when I started working on Ethereum. And we probably spoke the first time, June, July, something like that. And we met up in Berkeley, probably the first time, maybe August or September or thereabouts. By the way, since then, Jim continues to have a habit of building a full client to try to understand a piece of blockchain software. At some point, we were looking into the state of zero knowledge proofs, and he built a, I believe, full syncing Zcash client. It's definitely missing some features, but we still have that somewhere as you do as you do yeah as one does as one does um so yeah we actually we should revisit this at some later date but um so um he so yes we met up um he started coding and it got to the point of functional and syncing with the fairly primitive early test nets um pretty quickly um um and you know we we didn't quite intend to turn it into a business right at the beginning um but the three of us uh that's Victor Jim and I met up on January 2015 had a bunch of conferences that I've done I've spoken about you know at other times we can link people to the early days of Ethereum one perhaps that helped kind of galvanize the effort. But I think what we had was always like a pragmatic attitude, right? And so shortly after that, one of the first things we built, we found like the API interaction style to be a little odd, like the JSON RPC, the Web3 library. We're kind of like all other APIs are like this, where this is a REST API. We were kind of looking at chain.com. I think Chain actually sponsored the conference that we did or spoke or something. And it was a good like talk where it was like, well, we've got these 20 great use cases that people are doing out there in the world. Oh, and they're all on chain. Chain also fairly soon after that seemed to go a corporate chain direction.

SPEAKER_01: Was that sort of like a UTXO Bitcoin-y like?

SPEAKER_03: I assume so, yeah. I think they probably either forked one of the Bitcoin clients or maybe they started from scratch. But first, definitely, they were trying to be the Bitcoin developer API. It just didn't feel like there was enough demand at that time. And I assume, like us, it was a strange period where you actually got pretty active corporate inbound. Like sometime in 2015 and then later into 2016... it was very common for corporate innovation labs to be running some kind of blockchain tech usually in Ethereum variant and you know they were very explicit and maybe you know it's sort of like the early cloud days like we want that thing you've got but can you just get it on prem like can you just yeah can you just like we want the ledger we want to we want to know who the parties are You can't just let anyone in here. We're regulated. We want it, though. We really want it. We like this API you've got. Give it to us. We've got transactions to settle right now with our suppliers. And it all went way slower than that. But it was like the market was actually, like, screaming at you for a minute there in a way that, you know, the world feels much different now. Like, I think... It is certainly true that in the, I don't know, 70s or 80s or whatever, it was common for the Department of Defense or some giant bank or something to be your first customer. And much later, it's sort of more the opposite, that you'd get bottoms up devs, small companies first, and then later, really big guys. And it was sort of a strange mix. get i think there's like a barbell effect where really big companies have a lot of excess cash to investigate new technologies and then you get startups you know and and that was the feeling and we would get the the inbound from those really big companies and you know um i think that even that era you know it i bet they're all doing ai now and maybe maybe that adoption is going to It's probably mixed, but there was a moment there where it was like screaming urgent demand.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and I would say part of that also is like when we launched blockchain as a service with Microsoft and we made it easy to effectively build your own testnets on clouds, everyone started doing it, right?
