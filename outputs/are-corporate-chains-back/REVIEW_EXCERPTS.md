> The stream is live. The stream is live. Um, don't cross the streams. Who are you gonna call? You see what happens to the audio when you cross the streams. Yes, exactly. Okay. We seem to be also live on, on X. So welcome everyone to another, uh, Group chat by the... Mutual support group chat. Mutual support group, yeah. Yes, exactly. With the builders from Strava Mercada, I'm Victor Wong. I am founder and chief product officer at Strava Mercada. Bob, who are you? Hello, I'm head of ecosystem. And Kieran, who are you?

**Intermediate:**

> where I'm describing. Yeah. And Bob, what do you think? Do you have any of you to add on? Yeah, I mean, you know, I think a lot of it is just technical maturity as well. You know, there wasn't really any ZK back then. So it's like, how do you do privacy? How's that work? You know, and I mean, that's how Quorum like came into existence was that, you know, Amber and the team at JP Morgan wanted to do something. And without a privacy story, it was never going to get approved. They wouldn't be allowed to do anything. So it was like, okay, well, what's the thing we could do? Okay, we can have a private database and that can be offered around the side and you just do hashes on the main net and the other bits are permissioned. So it's kind of like there's a workaround for it. But, you know, they did that with open eyes, knowing like the ZK stuff is coming late, but it's not there. We have to do some hacky thing. Otherwise, we're literally not going to be allowed to do anything. I mean, this was also a story. I think that's true, too. And I'll add my take.
