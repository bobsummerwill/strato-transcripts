SPEAKER_00: The stream is live.

SPEAKER_04: The stream is live.

SPEAKER_00: Don't cross the streams. Who are you going to call? We'll see what happens to the audio when you cross the streets.

SPEAKER_04: Yes, exactly. Okay. We seem to be also live on X. So welcome everyone to another group chat by the Mutual support group chat.

SPEAKER_00: Mutual support group, yeah.

SPEAKER_04: Yes, exactly. With the builders from Strava Mercada, I'm Victor Wong. I am founder and chief product officer at Strava Mercada. Bob, who are you?

SPEAKER_01: Hello, I'm head of ecosystem.

SPEAKER_04: And Kieran, who are you?

SPEAKER_03: Kieran James Lubin, CEO, once a coder, you know, long time off. Code a little again. Vibe Coding Era has been great for making an occasional fix here and there. But soon we'll be back just doing commercial stuff.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I was playing around with the OpenAI browser today, and it was kind of miraculous just telling it to do stuff and seeing the cursor move around all by itself. Both miraculous and disturbing.

SPEAKER_03: It moves really slow. It does.

SPEAKER_04: It takes time to do stuff. But you just can't keep it running in the background. Anyways, today's topic, getting us back to the topic at hand, is basically our corporate chain's back. And we obviously have some intimate knowledge about this, having been part of the rise and perhaps fall and maybe the rise again of corporate chains. Hey Lewis, nice to have you. But maybe you can, maybe Bob, you can give us an outline of the new corporate chains as they're called, like what's kind of happening currently and then we can kind of look back over the history of corporate chains.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Well, I mean, the red hot action at the moment is really about Tempo. Tempo was announced on September the 4th by Stripe and a consortium that they got together, which just reading initial members as well as Stripe themselves, including Anthropic, Coupang. I don't know who those are. I'm not going to say all these. Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Mercury Bank, OpenAI. Revolut, Shopify and Visa. So, yeah, I mean, you got Shopify and Visa. You're doing pretty well on that payment side. Yeah. And yeah, I mean, I guess especially where a lot of this tension has come in. On the Ethereum side, this is going to be another EVM chain. So it's kind of like, thanks for the work, guys. We'll do a corporate version now. And so specifically, Paradigm are a big part of this. Now, Paradigm have spent the last few years kind of building up Ethereum stack stuff, you know, kind of being semi well-behaved participants within the Ethereum ecosystem, carry out a few VC nasty moments, but essentially building a really good new Rust client, right? They do some of the best tooling, you know, with Foundry, right? You know, what you had going on. In earlier years, right, they've made a better one. And I think there's about three or four areas where they built sort of Ethereum stack stuff, almost like, hey, here's a full stack, Ethereum stack. Oh, but actually, we're going over that. So like, we've got the answer. And we can just like do a new chain deployment. And off we go. So, yeah, that's not been received terribly well. Also, big brain drain, you know, that they are snuffling up a good number of fairly high profile people. Dankrad Feist, one of the main Ethereum researchers, key guy behind the proof of stake transition, years at work. You know him as a primary guy and he's off, you know, to get his paycheck. Fair play to him, you know, a number of other people as well. But that's been the current fire.

SPEAKER_04: Well, and to be clear also, I think we've been talking about Tempo, but they're not the only corporate chain. Like, you know, obviously Robinhood is launching an L2 on Arbitrum.

SPEAKER_01: I think it's an L1. Yeah, so Arbitrum's SPAC. But yeah, I don't know if it's an L2 or an L1. They've sort of talked about various bits on that. Circle announced ARK. They're not content to be a smart, sorry, a stable coin on other chains. It's like, right, we're gonna do our own chain as well. I mean, Base, you know, the whole Base thing from Coinbase, again, they haven't had a token, but you know, there's your straight path into Coinbase. Heather has a chain or soon, right?

SPEAKER_03: I think they announced something.

SPEAKER_01: Maybe. I mean, they started out before Ethereum stuff was going right. So there's an Omni that was previously Mastercoin, you know, super ancient tech, 2013 era. But then, you know, they later moved to Ethereum and many other chains. But yeah, like having their own totally is something that makes sense. And I mean, you've had Binance chain, BNB for years. Pretty much every major exchange seems to have their own chain now. Uniswap has its chain.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Uniswap has a chain. But I don't think of those as corporate chains.

SPEAKER_03: It's hard to tell, right? Is it for us, by us? Or is it sort of like... And I kind of see the Stripe chain as like the incursion of the establishment into our crypto turf, where it's like... And I kind of see Base that way a little bit, where I feel somehow less bad about Binance chain, even though Coinbase in some ways is like a better actor than Binance. But very much Coinbase just feels like part of the old thing to me.

SPEAKER_01: You know, there were various discussions I saw as well this week about Ethereum alignment. You know, what does that even mean? It's like, so these guys, they're Ethereum aligned, so it's okay. So it's okay.

SPEAKER_03: I think what it means is a strange thing that's going on, in which let's take it to Bitcoin for a second. I've been critical, at least privately, maybe publicly, of the Maxi mentality in which there will only be Bitcoin. There's only one sincere crypto asset. Everything after is a scam. And we should all put our energy into Bitcoin, but also never really add anything to Bitcoin. Maybe very slowly add small things around the margin.

SPEAKER_04: We believe in open markets, but we should be the only market. There should only ultimately be a single market.

SPEAKER_01: It's very hypocritical as well for libertarian types.

SPEAKER_03: It's like, no, this is all about freedom from the man, right? You know, yeah, you can't tell me what to do. Permissionless has changed, yeah, but not like that. Everything here just in this one approved location, yeah. So I think it's a little bit a repeat of that phenomenon. I mean, I get it also. I'm kind of a believer in the more permissive open source software licensing. At the same time, maybe Linux was right as far as GPL sort of forcing commercial efforts back one place. And you know, the BSDs survive basically with OS X to some extent. You know, and perhaps maybe it out-competed because it had a benevolent dictator genius, but maybe it out-competed in part because of the virality of the license. And this is not to say, I think there's a mix of licensing regimes. I know you've worked on this very directly, Bob, for the Ethereum software, some of it permissive, some not. But you know, it's sort of part of it's also like a lot of the Ethereum people did well enough to either launch the next thing on Ethereum or launch the next thing not on Ethereum and didn't really have any need for a job per se at some point. And so you would expect something new to come and maybe try to cannibalize the old thing. It's a strange sort of religiosity also.

SPEAKER_04: Well, maybe that's sort of a good transition. Maybe we can... You know, we as Blockapps and Strato went in with the Haskell implementation of Ethereum, went in a corporate chain direction. Maybe, like, you can talk about why we did that. Indeed. So we may be partly to blame for this.

SPEAKER_03: Partly to blame. You know, it was barely on purpose. So rolling back in 2018, let's say late 2014, our CTO Jim and I, mostly Jim, started working on the Haskell implementation of Ethereum. And he pretty quickly got it to the point where it could like sync the testnet, you know, and there were some chat groups, a Slack. There was a bit of the yellow paper, I guess, was out at that time.

SPEAKER_01: I found an exact date for this, actually. So Jim's first commit was mid-September 2014. The yellow paper had been out about April. Really? Yeah. Gotcha.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and he might have been working on it for a while before he pushed anything. I think I would have gotten back. So we met up, we got introduced by previous co-founder of Jim's, who I had reached out to when I started working on Ethereum. And we probably spoke the first time, June, July, something like that. And we met up in Berkeley, probably the first time, maybe August or September or thereabouts.

By the way, since then, Jim continues to have a habit of building a full client to try to understand a piece of blockchain software. At some point, we were looking into the state of zero knowledge proofs, and he built a syncing Zcash client. It's definitely missing some features, but we still have that somewhere.

SPEAKER_03: So yeah, we actually should revisit this at some later date. So he started coding and it got to the point of functional and syncing with the fairly primitive early test nets pretty quickly. And you know, we didn't quite intend to turn it into a business right at the beginning. But the three of us, that's Victor, Jim, and I, met up on January 2015, had a bunch of conferences that I've done. I've spoken about you know at other times we can link people to the early days of Ethereum one perhaps that helped kind of galvanize the effort.

SPEAKER_01: Was that sort of like a UTXO Bitcoin-y like?

SPEAKER_03: I assume so, yeah. I think they probably either forked one of the Bitcoin clients or maybe they started from scratch. But first, definitely, they were trying to be the Bitcoin developer API. It just didn't feel like there was enough demand at that time. And I assume, like us, it was a strange period where you actually got pretty active corporate inbound. Like sometime in 2015 and then later into 2016, it was very common for corporate innovation labs to be running some kind of blockchain tech, usually in Ethereum variant. And you know, they were very explicit and maybe you know it's sort of like the early cloud days. Like we want that thing you've got, but can you just get it on prem? Like can you just... Yeah, can you just... We want the ledger, we want to know who the parties are. You can't just let anyone in here. We're regulated. We want it, though. We really want it. We like this API you've got. Give it to us. We've got transactions to settle right now with our suppliers. And it all went way slower than that. But it was like the market was actually, like, screaming at you for a minute there in a way that, you know, the world feels much different now.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and I would say part of that also is like when we launched Blockchain as a Service with Microsoft and we made it easy to effectively build your own testnets on clouds, everyone started doing it, right?

SPEAKER_03: Yes.

SPEAKER_04: And the interesting thing is at that time, the real development seemed to be happening by these corporates in these innovation labs versus independent labs.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's right. It felt like okay, they would come to you with like a PowerPoint describing the billion plus dollar problem that they had. This is after all the NDAs were signed and all that sort of thing. This was like very convincing. It was like you know some of the use cases were bad but a lot of them are like oh okay like you have some like really complicated multi-organization settlement problem that you handle with spreadsheets or some ancient system and it costs a ton of money and if you actually could upgrade it it would be way better potentially.

SPEAKER_04: And I think part of it was at that early time, they couldn't hold ETH. So they were like, we won't do all these things, but we can't hold ETH. Can you make a version where we don't need to hold ETH to do all these things?

SPEAKER_03: Version where we don't need to do it to do all these things, yeah. I know, yeah. I totally forgot it was like treasury doesn't know what to do. This is pretty much like... You know, but like no, we've got our procedures. We can't have a line item for that.

SPEAKER_01: I remember with RSDB, who became Monax and so on, you know, there. So they started in 2014 as well when it was still on POC 5 before the mainnet. And there you had a situation of a company being set up by lawyers who really loved the smart contract functionality. But nothing to do with that. It's like F is probably in legal security. Like, we don't want to get anywhere near that.

SPEAKER_04: But the one thing that was really interesting, like when we launched that Blockchain as a Service and it got on Azure, like we had thousands of people spinning up stuff. And then a good number of them reaching out to us. And I will say the use cases that didn't seem speculative did come from these corporates, right? Like to Kieran's point, it's like... Like we did get contacted by sort of smaller groups, but they were like, oh, well, we just want to launch our own token and sell it like that. Those are all those use cases.

SPEAKER_03: That came a little later, actually. Once a couple of ICOs had happened, suddenly everyone wanted to pay someone to build their thing for an ICO. But that was kind of more like 2016 to 2018 phenomena. I would say. Yeah, that's true. The corporates came first, actually.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, exactly. And so, I mean, you know, that was our experience. And shortly afterwards, and Bob, you might have the timing, Libra by Facebook came along. And they were doing their own thing. Do you know the time? I think it was 18, 17. Yeah, we launched Blockchain as a Service in 2015, right?

SPEAKER_03: End of 2015.

SPEAKER_04: I'm feeling like it was 2016 that Libra launched.

SPEAKER_03: No, it was later, I think.

SPEAKER_04: Was it? Okay.

SPEAKER_01: Here we go.

SPEAKER_04: As a resident historian of all things blockchain.

SPEAKER_01: There we go. June the 18th, 2019. Oh, yeah. Isn't that right? I was one of them. Yeah. At that point, Meta, then Facebook. This was before they'd even turned into Meta. You know, announced it, which is a stablecoin project intended for global payments via its applications, sorry, via its apps.

SPEAKER_03: Their language seems pretty good to me, actually, but no one uses it. We're stuck with Solidity. Will be the JavaScript slash COBOL of the crypto age, we're never getting rid of this thing.

SPEAKER_04: Well, and you know, like, I think the EVM has become the standard, right? Like, that's just, you know, I mean, RedWong was mentioning that last week, and I think that that is true, basically, to a certain degree.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think it's the JavaScript. It's the C. It's good enough that stuff got made on it, and it's never going away. You know, this stuff is going to be there forever.

SPEAKER_04: But Libra had... Sorry. Yeah. But the launch of Libra, they had super high profile partners, if I recall.

SPEAKER_03: Very similar, actually, to the kind of... It was mostly like payment networks and notably no banks. It felt like a tech company-driven disintermediation play. Like, well, if we just had these stables, then we wouldn't have to have the bank account at the edge, too, and we could just...

SPEAKER_01: So here's a list. So Facebook, Uber, Spotify, Anderson Horowitz, Anchorage Bank, the digital custody, Lyft, Zappo, Coinbase, Union Square Ventures. So yeah, it's actually a crappier list by far than Tempo.

SPEAKER_03: You know, MasterCard was in until like the last second. Right. People started making regulator noise and they dropped, I think maybe Visa too.

SPEAKER_04: So I guess that gets into the question, like, why didn't that work? Right. Like, and I think we touched, like, I recall Mark Zuckerberg having to like talk to people. Congress?

SPEAKER_01: I just found these exits. So the major exits out of that were PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, Stripe, eBay. And they all dropped out real super fast, didn't they? And I mean, I think there was a mixture of things. This is my thoughts. Maybe you guys have got different thoughts. Firstly, everyone hated Facebook because they just have the Cambridge Analytica stuff. It's like, we're not going to trust you guys. Like, no. But then the second one was like regulatory stuff because it was going to be like because it was kind of going up against the dollar. Right. It was like, right, we're going to have a basket of things. So it wasn't just a straight stable coin. It's like, oh, we're kind of having a go at the US dollar.

SPEAKER_03: And they cut the banks out of it, too. That's the point. And it's also like, the banks are fond of making their market utilities. You know, they're bank-owned industry cabals like the SWIFT, the DTCC. A lot of the exchanges are like this. I guess even the Fed is bank-owned, but basically like... The banks pooled a bunch of capital a long time ago, and they set up this thing that you kind of have to use. And the profits from using that thing go back to them. And it's also like a choke point. And under other circumstances, you would have some sort of antitrust issue in doing this. It's kind of like definitionally collusion. But you also need these things to make the whole thing function.

SPEAKER_01: But I mean, that's happening here again, right? It's almost the same people. And it's basically saying, right, you know, the banks and the credit card companies to a lesser degree, like own these pipes. And we had to like sit on top kind of thing and service. Yeah. How about like if us fintech techie companies, the Silicon Valley ones instead, how about like... Cut all of them out.

SPEAKER_03: I think it would be cool if it happened. By the way, I always thought, though I'm a bit of a big tech hater, I always thought Libra was at least cool. Like, it would be interesting.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, the technology behind it, you know, it was UTXO-based, but it seemed pretty good. Like, they did a good job from the technology side.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think so. And not just doing like sort of a lazy job, I guess, because talking about some of those earlier phases, it's like, right, oh, we're going to take Bitcoin and it's an enterprise Bitcoin. OK, and then it's like, right, sort of same deal on the EVMs. But because they were that many years later, it was sort of almost like a clean room kind of effort. I think actually R3 did this with Corda, right? They did some really good blogs, right, from Richard G. Brown, sort of saying, hey, we looked at all of the things that these existing techs are doing, and whatever, there's these four or five different elements. And for our scenario, we need three of them, but we could do something else completely different. Coming up with a different kind of solution. I think that kind of happened with Libra as well.

SPEAKER_04: It's like, let's get some Brainiacs. Fabric too, right? Like, I mean, they were trying to do something.

SPEAKER_03: Fabric is a funny case too. I think in all of these cases, they correctly identified problems with Ethereum and related tech. And essentially none of them did they solve those problems. They came at it with different approaches. I really tried to, I always liked Corda too, it was clean. I actually find the UTXO stuff, especially enhanced UTXO, to be aesthetically pleasing. I think even Avalanche has one of those and no one uses it.

SPEAKER_01: You mean like something IBM might build?

SPEAKER_03: Yes, I'm saying.

SPEAKER_02: It's like, well, if you just kind of put this thing with that thing and there's a consensus, it's kind of like a blockchain. You'll never get sacked for buying it either.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you won't get stuck. It's open source.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and I think one of the common things was like all of those things had no token incentives, right? So like you kind of had to go down that route to a certain degree because how else do you make sure, how else do you get something blockchain-like? Like I do think if you don't have token incentives really, it all kinds of falls apart to a certain degree.

SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, the model that you had for all of these is, well, these are running within a consortium which already has legal agreements. So we don't need to be permissionless because we know who's done the bad shit and we've got a contract and we'll sue you or whatever. And if you have got that situation, well, there's a whole lot of simplification that you can do. You know, if you look at proof of work in particular, you know, and what that overhead that you have on Bitcoin or Ethereum at that time, you know, it's incredibly expensive way of doing things, versus the simpler approaches.

SPEAKER_03: I think the biggest factor is that the organizations were not ready to behave in a blockchain-y way. And at the time that manifested in feature requests, like it's missing X. Can my competitors see my customers? What are the balances? Will they be able to see total trading volumes, sales volumes? And that's still a problem on the public nets, et cetera. But it's sort of just like you kind of have to let it be, embrace it.

SPEAKER_04: And PayPal does it. PayPal does it.

SPEAKER_03: And that's what they would have needed to do. And instead it was like, they had to like go very top down. There's budgeting, setting up legal entities, maybe investing in a consortium, very tight rules about how the data could flow, which data, all that sort of thing. And it sort of, it led to like a strangulation where you would kind of just need to like let it bloom a little bit.

SPEAKER_04: So like the bigger you are, just like... I think Victor you maybe mentioned to me once working on one for like a full decade. And when I started, when I started at a company they were they had already been working on an SAP implementation and when I left six years later they were still working on it.

SPEAKER_03: It's hard to do things incrementally in corporate, but in part it's because it's super complicated and very regulated and whatever, but it's also mentality too. Just kind of like turn it on and then just start it. I mentioned this is what happened with the cloud. They're like, all right, let me just do this one little thing. And it's easy and you keep just putting more and more on there.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And Bob, what do you think? Do you have any of you to add on?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, you know, I think a lot of it is just technical maturity as well. You know, there wasn't really any ZK back then. So it's like, how do you do privacy? How does that work? You know, and I mean, that's how Quorum like came into existence was that, you know, Amber and the team at JP Morgan wanted to do something. And without like a privacy story, it was never going to get approved.

SPEAKER_04: I think that's true, too. I'll add my take.

SPEAKER_03: While I agree with you, I still think everyone who found that deficiency, none of them solved it better, really, than what exists in the public chains out there today.

SPEAKER_01: No.

SPEAKER_03: It is kind of... I keep asking the AIs and looking around the internet on the state of ZK, still not really there, maybe a little bit. The enterprises all want the following permissioning model. I should be able to send value to Victor. He should know that whatever I have really exists. You should be able, he should be able to sell, send it on to you. You should be able to verify that Victor had it, but not know that it came from me or how much he has total. And the regulator should somehow be able to see all of this, at least in a financial services setting.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I mean, I think it is both because payments is quite different from lots of other things happening on the blockchain side, right? Yeah. You know, savings, store of value, dApps. You're not going to run dApps on Tempo. Yeah. You're not going to save your money in Tempo coin.

SPEAKER_03: Right. I agree. There will not be a lot of DeFi on Tempo, for instance, sort of because it would be too closed of an environment. You won't get the compositional aspect of things, probably because they won't allow it.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah. So my view is that the projects that might succeed in this space have to have two properties. One is they have to be driven by a... at least mostly one company. I don't think this idea of the bigger names who have all together, like we've experienced this, that just slows everything down.

SPEAKER_01: And I guess also because, you know, their customer base are crypto-y people. You know, it's a similar kind of group. And they understand those demands, right?

SPEAKER_04: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Tempo will be going for retail. It's going to be normal retail, you know, Apple Pay, Tempo Pay.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. You're not going to know you're using Tempo, most likely.

SPEAKER_04: I mean, I think the first victim is Swift, really. Like, I think it, but yeah. So, well, on that note, I'll give a quick preview to everyone. Let's wrap up today's conversation. Thank you for joining us. Quick preview for next week. We have Brian, founder of PistachioFi, joining us next week to talk about starting a new project. And his background, actually, he was previously an employee at BlockApp, so we know him very, very well.

SPEAKER_04: So if you want to find us, we're always doing this every week. But if you want to find me, you can find me on X at Vic4Wong. You can find out why it's, I have the form, my name. Bob has posted that on our Telegram. Thanks. Bob, where can people find you if they want to hear more from you?

SPEAKER_01: So yeah, again, X. So Bob Summerwill, Will. So Summer like the season, Will like write your will. That's me.

SPEAKER_04: And Kieran, where can people find you?

SPEAKER_03: Also X, K. James Lubin. That's K. James Lubin. L-U-B-I-N. James, J-A-M-E-S. Well, thank you everyone for joining us and have a great week.

SPEAKER_04: Talk to you soon.

SPEAKER_00: Cheers, guys.

SPEAKER_04: Thanks.
