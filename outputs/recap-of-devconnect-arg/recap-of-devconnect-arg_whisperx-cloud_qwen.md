**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** We are on, and welcome everyone to our recap of DevConnect Argentina. I'm Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato. Three CPO? Three CPO, maybe. Three CPO. I may be looking very robotic, so if I am, then you know.

**[00:28] SPEAKER_04:** So let's go around the horn and introduce ourselves before we kick it off. Kieran, you want to go? Sure. I'm Kieran. I'm our CEO. I guess, you know, okay, so Strato, we have been, I guess we're hard announcing it now. We are... The labs company, if you will, has always been called BlockApps. And I'm actually the CEO of BlockApps as we're transitioning to a mainnet open source kind of foundation-given project. First, we called that Strato Mercado because Mercado was sort of a separate product and we've purposefully sunset everything else. So going back to the OG Strato at this time. So I guess I'm the—does Strato have a CEO? Like we're jumping in with two feet, Victor. Yeah, exactly. Well, I just was kind of soft peddling it, but I didn't know if you wanted to make the announcement though. That's cool. Well, but you said of Strato, so it was too late.

**[01:34] SPEAKER_01:** I think I've already changed it in my mind. So maybe it's not like, and thanks for that, Bob. Yeah. And that's it. OG, OG. So Strato was unveiled at DevCon One.

**[01:53] SPEAKER_03:** I don't know what exact date that was. You know, it might be almost exactly 10 years like right now. I think it's very close to 10 years. I think it was early December, maybe a week off. No, no, no. I think it was in October or November because it wasn't that cold. It was in London. And I remember it was not miserable yet, which is normal during London at that time. I will keep looking off to the side. Okay, you're a resident historian, Bob.

**[02:21] SPEAKER_01:** I see a YouTube video, December 11th, 2015. Now there's a later though. They got released later. Yeah. Yeah. So, well, Bob, do you want to do a quick—who are you? I'm head of ecosystem. So, you know, joined the team this year, but long-time friend. Yes. Long-time listener, first-time caller, right? Yeah.

**[02:51] SPEAKER_00:** And Jim, who are you? I am James from SDR. I am CTO of BlockApps and one of the three founders.

**[03:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yes. And of Strato too, as Kieran has announced. So let's dive right into it. What were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires? Who wants to start here?

**[03:28] SPEAKER_04:** I guess I can quickly—hopefully quickly. I know we all have a tendency to ramble. One of my big surprises, let's say the city itself. I was surprised to find that I was in Europe. I was expecting to be in South America. And I guess everyone knows this. They call it like the Paris of South America or something, but quite beautiful place. The mix of the food varied from really excellent, especially on the steak front. That is all true—if anyone is on the fence about Argentinian steak, go and try it, to medium. Sometimes service very slow. The city does not look that big. Like somehow all of the hotels near the venue were booked out. So I ended up staying about 20 minutes away by car. If there's no traffic, it was like nine to 12 minutes away, but it was consistently about 25 minutes away. It's all mid-rises, like four to six or eight stories, and it's like that for a pretty large geographic area, which I found quite interesting. Yeah. It had a little bit of an old world feel, kind of narrow, but super cool. People are very nice, maybe except for the slow service—it wasn't snooty slow service, it was just slow service. So hard to get things; you had to budget more time than you expected for things, which we found out the hard way. But would go back—very cool place.

**[05:11] SPEAKER_03:** And what about DevConnect itself? How did you feel about the conference? And you might want to mention what was the reaction to prices tanking during the event itself. But first, we should mention what DevConnect even is. Oh, yeah. So as a resident historian of Ethereum, what is DevConnect?

**[05:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so it's a major conference held by the Ethereum Foundation. There are actually two different conference series that run now. So DevCon, which was originally Developer Conference, obviously has become not a Developer Conference anymore. I don't know when it was last a Developer Conference. Maybe two—probably DevCon Two-ish. Maybe. It kept getting bigger. Two was big, but not huge.

**[06:04] SPEAKER_04:** I'm thinking in terms of the content, though. No, I know, but they kind of correlated, right? Yeah, yeah. The more people that wanted to come, the lower percentage devs somehow. Well, I kind of remember at Two they had DevCon, and then next to it they had like...

**[06:21] SPEAKER_01:** I think it was called like World Blockchain. Yeah, I mean, that one was a combined event. But yeah, I guess probably DevCon Three in 2017 was the switch over where you had like a thousand people. So it switched from a meet your peers, talk about all the different development projects going on to more of a hey, here are the big talks and whoo. But yeah, we're on to—we have seven now. So DevCon Seven was in Bangkok last October, I think. But yeah, they started doing DevConnect as well, which is really intended to not be a conference, to be a collection of different events connecting developers and community. So I was expecting it to be a fair bit smaller, but it absolutely wasn't. But it did have a different flavor to DevCon in that you had lots of little things—lots of many events under that same banner, obviously side events as well. Even if you just got a ticket for the main thing with a theme of World Fair, you know, really bringing people from around the world to show what they're working on. But I didn't expect it to be as big. Like, I think it probably was as big as DevCon really in the numbers. I mean, effectively, I think they've become the same. It's just basically whatever they were trying to keep it small and more developer-friendly, but I think in terms of signal-to-noise ratio these DevCons are probably still the highest compared to more businessy conferences.

**[08:03] SPEAKER_03:** Jim, what were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires? I've heard you said you're worried about being too negative, but...

**[08:30] SPEAKER_00:** There is no... Go for it. Yes. I mean, there was a lot of good stuff down there. First of all, I actually, in part to avoid having a huge flight down there, I broke up multiple destinations down South America on the way there. Saw a lot of really cool stuff in Central and South America the week before. Argentina is beautiful. Conference itself had some very cool things there, but I think I really preferred the format of what happened in Bangkok the year before. There were certain things about the format here that made it difficult. First thing is that there was less going on at the main venue and we had to spend a lot of time signing up for all these offsite things. And these offsite things were big and would go on for hours, so they'd pull you away from the main event for the whole day. Maybe you could come back at the end of the day. But then I tried that a little bit at first—I signed up for an offsite thing and then came back, and once I got to the main event, you're just wandering around and it was hard. Did you guys find a good schedule for what was happening right there? Because mostly I was just walking around, and there was one area—I guess it was the yellow pavilion where the big room was—and you could get a couple small talks there, but mostly it was just outdoor study areas and not as much going on in the main area.

**[10:16] SPEAKER_04:** I don't know. What did you guys think about that break apart? It was haphazard, but I liked a bunch of the main stage talks. There were a few good ones on Friday. There were good opening ones. And then there was a little amphitheater that had some of the good DeFi app talks. But I agree it was sort of a crapshoot. The registration procedures—sometimes you had to register for an event that was inside the venue. Sometimes that wouldn't work, but you would go by the booth or whatever, and they would just tell you, oh yeah, just don't worry, just show up. So it contributed to an impression of never quite knowing—agendas weren't really posted for any of these side events. They weren't even really posted for the main event until like the night before. They were kind of lazily, in the computer science sense, updating the agendas as you went. So it was very hard to come in with a target and hit everything with that target. You kind of had to just go with the flow. But I still got quite a lot out of it, even with that. But the endless registrations were quite annoying. And there were big side events in the event, small ones. Like I discovered a couple days in there was a quite large Polygon side event in the main venue.

**[12:01] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it was sort of hard to... What I liked about DevCon is because everything was right there together, and you could kind of walk to something else. That's way better. You could test something out, and if it was looking silly, you could just run out and find another room. So it allowed you to... I don't know—it's like looking for a movie on Netflix. You can try a bunch of movies and then settle on one versus the olden days where you had to buy a ticket to go to a theater. If you bet wrong, you're out of luck. That's what a lot of this felt like—I would sign up for some event and then that would be like a half-hour drive out of the main event. And by the time things would start, if it hit me I was into something silly, I'd still be like, well, maybe I should stay a little bit longer. I did sign up for this, and I can't sign up for another thing right now. Main area—I had a couple of good ones there. But often, just the topic wasn't something I was interested in at the moment.

**[13:08] SPEAKER_03:** Well, I found what was kind of strange was that you signed up for these large blocks of time and then the agenda wouldn't be clear when you were signing up. Right. And then you might see one good talk in that. Like some of them lasted nine to five, so you get one good talk in there and then people were just hanging out co-working and having coffee for most of it. The talks were in this tight segment that they didn't name until much later. Yes, exactly. And some of them were important—like Vitalik saying something—and then the rest were hit or miss.

**[13:48] SPEAKER_00:** You know, hit or miss kind of afterwards. So I tended to find out about Vitalik speaking by seeing that he was speaking. Yeah. Like you happen to be there, and then he's coming on. And I kind of would have liked to have seen that too, but I had signed up for a thing and was across town when Kieran mentioned, hey, Vitalik's speaking here now. And I was like, well...

**[14:17] SPEAKER_03:** That was a day that I probably chose unwisely too. I wasn't happy with the talks I had gone to that day. Well, speaking of that, maybe we can touch upon some of the big themes at DevConnect. Let's start with the headline thing about Vitalik saying elliptic curves are going to die. That seemed to make a lot of news. And quantum computing was coming for us all. What were your thoughts on that?

**[14:46] SPEAKER_04:** This is a Jim question. I guess, yeah, let's start with Jim. Bring out that background, Jim. I'll pass this to Kieran. OK, so I will say that both Jim and I have a physics background, but mine was more from the math side where we're good at the beauty of the equations but don't necessarily have an intuitive sense of the physics. The physics people were good at estimating the answer and then back-working into the actuality of it. The math people might have been better at the math side, though physicists are quite good at it too. So nevertheless, I had spent some time in quantum and the machinery on how a quantum computer might work. I still don't have much evidence that it's coming soon. But would you really—I don't know. It's hard to keep secrets under wraps. Governments and private sector researchers are probably putting a bunch of money into it. For a long time, Google got it to 20 qubits and they stayed together for 10 to the negative seven seconds instead of negative nine, and it computed the divisors of 63 or something like that. So I don't know how we would know when quantum is coming. We would know these coins are stolen. But even then, you might not want to do that. I also think cryptography tends to come back pretty fast. There's already quantum-resistant stuff, and it'd be a hard switch over. Once you knew Bitcoin were still getting stolen, you might still have a little time to migrate over—or you just snapshot all the balances at one date when you're pretty sure. I don't know how we would deal with it, but I'm often skeptical. Color me a little skeptical on quantum happening much faster than people expect, which is the real scenario we're worried about. It's one of those stories always in the news—oh, there's some big breakthrough or progress in quantum computers coming in a couple of years—but that's what they've been saying for decades now.

**[17:55] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, and it seems like quantum resistance was a big theme. There were a lot of people claiming research or advances in quantum resistance at the conference. So Ethereum is probably better situated to implement quantum resistance. It would be painful, but it would be very hard to do it on Bitcoin more structurally.

**[18:26] SPEAKER_01:** They like change less. Yeah, exactly. But what do you think, Bob? What was your impression of that? Yeah, I mean, you can't really tell when the thing's coming up. I'm not worried, really. It's like everyone's talking about it, so it'll be fine. Everyone's very aware. It's a known problem that a bunch of people are working on, but it's unknown when it's going to hit us. Honestly, there are chains that already have quantum resistance stuff. It just seems to be a cost thing—okay, it's probably not a problem, so why make ourselves less competitive now? I don't think it's a market winner to say, oh yeah, we're 10x slower but you know we're resistant. But it's obviously an incoming matter. The hotter matter really is privacy. I think that's really... Well, the other thing in between those two things is ZK. Maybe we can start with you this time, Bob.

**[19:19] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So talking about where we went, I was mainly just in the main venue with the exception of the day before the main event where we had the second Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress, which is a good fun event. And the other thing on the final day was the Ethereum Privacy Stack event. Both were organized by Web3 Privacy Now—the second one in collaboration with the privacy guys at the Ethereum Foundation. That is a pretty new group—I think about 50 people working on that. Wow. A lot of youth. Good for them. So yeah, pretty serious and in multiple different areas. They've got the Kotaku project, which basically seems to be an SDK and tooling to help with integration of privacy features into wallets using existing projects with Railgun being a key one—basically, hey, here's how to plug in privacy into an existing wallet. We've done most of the work. Also, on that, one of the major main talks on the last day was Vitalik and Roger Dingledine—great name, of Tor—really talking about the Torification of Ethereum, which is planned. So that was a bit of a reveal that there is work underway to look at all the different levels and components of that protocol stack and work out how to un-unify them really, or at least make them tool-friendly, including things like block formation and the validator leader stuff and hiding all of that.

**[21:46] SPEAKER_03:** I want to jump in quickly on the Congress. I want to hate a little bit first. I saw the Infinite Garden appear on the screen again. Like a DevConnect, you mean? Sorry.

**[22:06] SPEAKER_04:** No, no. I'm a type of Congress. I'm not sure you saw that one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I took a picture of it for the record. Put it in the show notes. We're like halfway to a wartime EF, but we've kept the old generals and put them on the National Guard or something, the Coast Guard. Yeah. And let me connect this to a broader point. I really liked that you saw a bunch of the old faces at DevConnect—people who have been around for a long time. When I watched the Sky and Uniswap talks, Sky has always formerly been MakerDAO—I'm against this rebrand—but they seem to really take being a DAO seriously. A lot of DAOs are sort of marketing and led pretty top-down, but they were up there talking about the DAO way of doing things. They've got proposals that you vote on. I'm sure it's still a little bit oligarchic, but they really meant the DAO part on some level. I was talking to a cool guy who I need to follow up with, actually, with Victor, and we were showing him the app on the phone, and he was like, oh, are you getting a whole node on there? I was like, no. Those days... We've given up on this dream, I think. It's about being fast. You're not going to run the node on the phone. Even if you could, it's going to melt. Maybe one day—maybe the tech on the watch. Note on the watch. Exactly. On the Apple Watch. So I'm making fun of it a little bit, but I like that these people still exist. It's like 2017, 2015. The same things. And in that same conversation, we're talking to an old friend of ours. He's like, yeah, Railgun, it's great, but I want it to go harder. I want there to be one account for the whole network that all activity goes under, and then you use your ZK receipts to pull out what's specific to you about all that. I was like, hell yeah. Let's go hardcore dreamer cypherpunk. And almost no other conferences like that. I haven't been to a big Solana builder conference, but I assume those are pretty commercial just from the whole Solana ecosystem ethos. I'm surprised these people are still around, but this is great. So I wanted to throw a plug out—if you're on crypto Twitter too much, you worry that literally everything about the industry is price action. And there are still some true believers. It's kind of the same people that it was somewhere between 2015 and 2017. So Left Terrorists did a good tweet—a good little video clip—because Left Terrorists...

**[25:06] SPEAKER_01:** Um, you know, famously one of those OG builders with Rotki—portfolio management software that he has as his main product being offline, so it's a local app. He had a good new phrase as well: aligned apps, with that alignment being with you, the user—not some weird Ethereum alignment or anything, but saying it's on your side. But the tweet that he had was about the network—the Wi-Fi was just wrecked. Many of the days, nothing. Even data on your phone was pretty shit because there were so many people doing it at the same time. But he did a little video saying the network's down, but my app still runs. Look.

**[25:54] SPEAKER_03:** Not to push back against what you're saying, but I do think the privacy people have kind of gotten more customer-aligned than purely philosophical-aligned. Like in the Ethereum Privacy Summit, I heard many times: yes, we want consumer privacy; no, we don't want to support North Korea or pedophiles, which seems to be the right line to draw.

**[26:40] SPEAKER_04:** Well, okay, there's a debate. Bob, do you want to jump in? I ran into Amin during the conference who seems to have created this debate. You might have more context on it than I do, but I'll backfill if need be.

**[27:05] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, sure. So I guess specifically there, you have this philosophical question: if you do have a privacy tech, should that be unconditionally single anonymity set with the whole world? Obviously, the larger anonymity set you have, the better security you have, with the ideal being it's everything—all transactions for everything. So that's the scenario you have with Monero, though Monero is using ring signatures at the moment. There are plans for use of ZK—it's a full membership proof thing that they've got proposed—but right now it's just ring sigs. But it's on by default: privacy on by default, mixing with everything by default. On the other side, on Zcash, for example, you can have transparent transactions or go into the different shielded pools. So the one you're talking about in particular is Privacy Pools. Privacy Pools was either a suggestion from Vitalik or Vitalik was one of many—he's on the paper. A number of coauthors, but Soleimani is a primary guy, and Zach Cole as well. They just did a raise at Oxbow, which I believe raised three and a half million—a responsible number, maybe about how much it might cost to develop the technology and a little bit more. But the approach there—and it was really in reaction to the legal action on Tornado Cash—was really saying, okay, if you do this blind privacy approach, you do intermingle yourself with North Korea and terrorists and crime. And the Monero reaction to that is yes, but if you can back up—so a primary thing was not wanting to have that disassociation, but also not wanting developers to go to jail. And saying, if you can credibly show a ZK proof that you are not in the same group as these known baddies, then that's a kind of responsible middle ground. It does affect your anonymity set, but maybe not that much.

**[30:19] SPEAKER_04:** Never a user of any of these technologies. I'm sure I will test some at de minimis amounts at some point. Tornado Cash—terrible name. I believe it actually also contained a capability at least to prove source of funds on one side. So you could prove that your funds were acquired legitimately, even if they were obscured later. I don't think you can do severability with the bad funds. And that's the key point that Amin was telling me is the difference. But the counterfactual the hardcore other side cypherpunks would say is something like, well, what about cash? All cash is dirty. It's all been used in some bathroom to get some illegal substance from point A to point B. It's still the preferred technology for certain kinds of money laundering. They have serial numbers, I guess, but we don't go and say cash is the problem. And the anonymity set of cash includes lots of bad acts. So this presumption of guilt—if you're putting your money in the pool, you're aiding and abetting North Korean money laundering—I don't buy it at all. On the other side, you don't want to seed that argument, and everywhere in the world is trying to seed that argument. The banking system definitely has a guilty-by-default ethos: prove everything about you, we'll surveil every transaction, and we'll tell you if you're allowed to bank. I think there's certainly a very valid argument on that side.

**[32:33] SPEAKER_01:** Sort of like this supposition of you going, but it wasn't me, sir—here's my ZK proof, I promise. What's a ZK proof? Like what are you even talking about? Exactly. So if you pick this half step, you're kind of just saying, oh, you use this privacy tech, but you're like, what are the easy ones to pick off? And it makes it a permission system again. Yeah. And you could say, oh, it's only a bit, but... Amin said it does break the fungibility, which is kind of a way of saying the same. It's like with Bitcoin—you have tainted ones and not. But talking to Zach, it seemed a primary motivation wasn't so much being compliant as it was—we don't want any more of our friends to go to jail. Totally. Yeah, I guess. And maybe that's a passing phase.

**[33:33] SPEAKER_04:** It's that these—at the same time, I don't really know what the Tornado Cash people did other than build software. Could have been more than building the software. There's no way that building some software should count as a conspiracy to launder money.

**[33:57] SPEAKER_01:** Like that's never applied in any other case, really—maybe except as regards the crypto industry. Also worth saying, though, I think is that many parts of the world are not so progressive as the US on that matter.

**[34:12] SPEAKER_03:** Well, Jim, I think we're starting to get a little bit over 30 minutes. I wanted to touch base with you. I know you're still pretty jet-lagged—what were your impressions at the conference, especially since you attended a lot of agentic AI talks too? How real is that? What were your big takeaways?

**[34:38] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I was pretty excited to go to anything AI. But I don't know—we're sort of in the hype part of the hype cycle right now. I went on the first day to one where multiple... it was like typical people speaking would be somebody who had put together a company using AI to maybe go and do DeFi trading or something like that. It would holistically understand what's happening in the world and try to use that to trade. There were panels of people with a variant of that story. It was all very inspirational sounding and a little bit light on the details, but everybody was very excited by it. But I'm sitting there listening, and I'm like, there's no way this stuff is really cool—there's no way they're doing it. And I remember... it would be a much bigger deal if some of these succeeded. And most—it's funny because at these events you can still have a lot of marketers, but there's still enough geeks that sometimes people just blurt out honest things. After hearing lots of marketing speak, I remember—I forget who it was—but one guy had been spinning up this whole story again, and he was like, oh, and this actually works. And he got a little too honest: oh, if this thing actually worked, do you think I'd be sitting here right now? So that was the theme to me—over-promising some really cool ideas, but it didn't look like it was actually happening. And this is kind of the case in AI in general right now. There are huge breakthroughs—AIs can do a lot of stuff that would have shocked me just a few years ago—but it's hard to get them to actually complete the whole job for you or work as advertised. So that was the common theme I was seeing there in these talks.

**[37:06] SPEAKER_01:** Did you see anything with post apps? Any kind of post apps—hey, look, you can just AI drive this and that kind of text or voice interface as opposed to UI?

**[37:25] SPEAKER_00:** I'm confused. Post applications, right? Soon we won't have applications. Post apps, yes. Or was it more infrastructure stuff that you were seeing? It looked like infrastructure stuff, what I heard, but there were many, many groups up there talking about it. The trading bots are arguably post apps—you kind of tell them what to do and they theoretically give you more money than you had when you gave it to them—is like a little financial manager. But I also think, like I've said before, when I've test-driven Klein and told it to go do a swap on our testnet, it can do it. Yeah. But it goes pretty slow through the UI—it's understanding it visually. And I don't know that it's that much easier than a human. But I think you could mostly give a declarative intention to an AI—hey, I want to rebalance from Bitcoin into Bitcoin and ETH. Well, I think they can do it, but it's not like... sorry, good, Jim.

**[38:21] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I guess there is a subtle distinction between an agent and a helper or just using AI as the UI. As an autonomous agent, that's the stuff that seems not quite baked to me yet. But I saw a couple talks where people were talking about just using it in place of the existing UIs that are out there right now to help you each step of the way do things. And that probably is great. We all sort of use AI and that kind of thing.

**[38:49] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I did hear a very interesting talk by the people formerly in FIRA, but now DIN—Decentralized Infrastructure Network—who were talking about really thinking about AI agents as users and how to make it easier for them to interact with the network. So from that point of view, I do think there's some—I don't think it's really replacing UX. I think it's more targeting a different class of user entirely than AI agents.

**[39:11] SPEAKER_04:** Let me add to that. For a long time, I've been worried about our mobile story. During the conference, I was using our app on mobile a bunch. And while I'm still worried about it, I think in many cases, it will be leapfrogged by just like, hey, chat, go do this thing in this app for me. There's a downside to that—we have just yet another aggregator—but an upside in that you might not have to make a really slick mobile app. Yeah. And I think that'll continue. And I've also seen pretty funny things. Some B2B SaaS Twitter handle made some posts—yeah, we sold the enterprise our app, we wanted them to use it more, so we made an AI to use it for them, and they're using it more.

**[39:51] SPEAKER_03:** Well, what you described—I heard the MetaMask team really talking about intents, like trying to instead of making you do a lot of clicks, just tell it, okay, this is what I'm trying to achieve, and then find me the best savings, right? And then we'll go and do all of that stuff.

**[40:12] SPEAKER_04:** I know we're over time, so I want to go around the horn and say, what is the biggest takeaway you got from this DevConnect? Let's start with you, Kieran. Privacy seems much more viable now than I thought. I've been generally a skeptic, even us having worked on it a bunch. But I think there are pretty solid mainnet live use cases for it that work now that we could also incorporate. I honestly think if we're talking about consumer mass adoption, you can't really have these clear text balances. Yes, it's pseudonymous, but it makes everybody uncomfortable. Bob is fond of quoting the time when very obviously one of the Ethereum core devs moved like a quarter billion dollars into Binance or whatever. It's not... I've tried to accelerate our privacy roadmap in response. Jim, what was your big takeaway from this conference?

**[40:51] SPEAKER_00:** I think the coolest thing that I saw, if it's real, is ZK—also one of these things prone to overhyping. But it seems like maybe scalability of Ethereum might be solved through some ZK means sometime in the next couple of years. If that really happens, maybe I've heard something about that before, but I probably just ignored it. But people were talking about it like it's around the corner right now. Looked into it a little bit. If it does what they say it does, it could be pretty impressive. So that was exciting to me. Bob, what was the biggest takeaway from you?

**[41:14] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, and I think that's true on a few different pieces—both in terms of privacy, but also scaling. I think some of these things have taken so long. Here we are 10 years in. Just looked—it was November the 10th, by the way, the Strato talk. Congratulations, yeah—exactly, almost exactly. But yeah, some of these things have taken 10 years really to get where we thought we'd get in a few months even. And yeah, I think that the ZK-ification of the L1—basically you end up with not really doing any execution on the old one; it's just proofs of things that are happening up above in whatever execution environment that might be. So yeah, I'm feeling very... We didn't talk about the price action, but that does not at all reflect where we are on the tech, which I think was a really positive checkpoint for me—like, shit, a lot of these things are really there, and things moving really fast. So if we look back in five years, say, or even three, I think we're gonna be in a great place where it's like we're almost feature complete maybe.

**[42:10] SPEAKER_03:** Software is never really feature complete, but I would say the biggest takeaway I had is that this ZK proving—which is different than the compilation part—has come way faster and way down. Last year when they were talking about it, I think a typical proof took minutes and required 48 GPUs. Now I'm seeing two GPUs and closer to the 10-second real-time holy grail that we're getting to. When I looked at the things on fboot.org, I was really impressed with how close it was and what people are doing there. So I think we'll call it there because we're already 15 minutes over. But where can we find you? I'm Victor Wong. You can find me at X at Vic4Wong, W-O-N-G. Kieran, where can we find you?

**[42:56] SPEAKER_04:** K. James Levin on X and most places.

**[43:00] SPEAKER_00:** Uh, still Twitter, and I've also forgotten my handle again. I should probably—you should remind me next time to look it up. It's what was it—John John or something? I looked it up but I can't—it was like two weeks ago.

**[43:13] SPEAKER_01:** You're good. This is a weekly pop quiz for you, Jim. So you better learn it. Look at the notes on our website. I always do the link. I always apply to that and correct it. And yeah, so I'm Bob Summerwill—Summer like the season and W-I-L, write your will on Twitter. And thank you for joining us. Take care. I'm looking at my handle right now. It's Jamsheed Hormoz.

**[43:41] SPEAKER_03:** You get a 50% just pass. That's even more embarrassing than failing. His own.
