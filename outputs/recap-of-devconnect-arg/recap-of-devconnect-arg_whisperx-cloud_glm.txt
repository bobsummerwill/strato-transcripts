**[0.9s] SPEAKER_03:**
We are on, and welcome everyone to our recap of DevConnect Argentina. I'm Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato. Three CPO? Three CPO, maybe. Three CPO. I may be looking very robotic, so if I am, then you know, like that.

**[28.1s] SPEAKER_04:**
So let's go around the horn and introduce ourselves before we kick it off. Kieren, you want to go? Sure. I'm Kieren. I'm our CEO. I guess, you know, okay, so Strato, we have been, I guess we're hard announcing it now. We are the labs company, if you will, has always been called BlockApps. And I'm actually the CEO of BlockApps as we're transitioning to a main net open source kind of foundation given project. First, we called that Strato Mercado because kind of Mercado was sort of a separate product and we've kind of purposefully sunset everything else. So going back to the OG Strato at this time. So I guess I'm the, does Strato have a CEO? Like we're jumping in with two feet, Victor. Yeah, exactly. Well, I just, I was kind of soft peddling it, but I didn't know if you want to make the announcement though. That's cool. Well, but you said of Strato, so it was too late.

**[94.2s] SPEAKER_01:**
I think I've already changed it in my mind. So maybe it's not like, and, and thanks for that, Bob. Yeah. And that's it. OG, OG. So, uh, Strato was, uh, you know, unveiled at DevCon one, um,

**[113.0s] SPEAKER_03:**
I don't know what exact date that was. You know, it might be almost exactly 10 years like right now. I think it's very close to 10 years. I think it was early December, maybe a week off. No, no, no. I think it was in October or November because it wasn't that cold. It was in London. And I remember it was not miserable yet, which is normal during London at that time. I will keep looking off to the side. Okay, you're a resident historian, Bob.

**[141.7s] SPEAKER_01:**
I see a YouTube video, December 11th, 2015. Now there's a later though. They got released later. Yeah. Yeah. So, well, Bob, you, um, do you want to do a quick, who are you? I'm head of ecosystem. So, you know, joined the, joined the team this year, but, uh, you know, long time, long time friend. Yes. Long time listener. First time caller, right? Yeah.

**[171.0s] SPEAKER_00:**
And Jim, who are you? I am James from SDR. I am CTO of BlockApps and one of the three founders.

**[180.6s] SPEAKER_03:**
Yes. And of Strato too, as Kieren has announced. So let's dive right into it. What were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires? Who wants to start here?

**[208.7s] SPEAKER_04:**
I guess I can quickly, hopefully quickly. I know we all have a tendency to ramble. One of my big surprises, let's say the city itself. I was surprised to find that I was in Europe. I was expecting to be in South America. And I guess everyone knows this. They call it like the Paris of South America or something, but quite beautiful place. The mix of like the food varied from really excellent, especially on the steak front. That is all true for if anyone is on the fence about the Argentinian steak, go go and try it to, you know, like medium, sometimes, you know, service very slow. The city does not look that big. Like somehow, you know, like all of the hotels near the venue were booked out. So I ended up staying about 20 minutes away by car and if there's no traffic, it was like nine to 12 minutes away, but it was consistently about 25 minutes away. It's all like, it's all kind of like mid rises, like four to six or eight stories. And it's like that for like a pretty large geographic area, which I found quite interesting. Yeah. It had like a little bit of an old world feel it's kind of narrow uh but yeah super cool people are very nice um maybe except for the slow service wasn't like snooty slow service it was just a slow service you know so hard to get things you had to budget more time than you expected for things which we found out the hard way but um would go back very cool place.

**[311.0s] SPEAKER_03:**
And what about DevConnect itself? How did you feel about the conference? And, you know, you might want to mention, like, you know, what was the reaction to prices tanking during the event itself? We'll tell you the other thing that we should mention first is what DevConnect even is. Oh, yeah. So as a resident historian of Ethereum, what is DevConnect?

**[334.5s] SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, so it's a major conference held by the Ethereum Foundation. There's actually two different conference series that run now. So DevCon, which was originally Developer Conference, obviously has become not a Developer Conference anymore. I don't know when it was last a Developer Conference. Maybe two, probably DevCon two-ish. Maybe. It kept getting bigger. Two was big, but not huge.

**[364.9s] SPEAKER_04:**
I'm thinking in terms of the content, though. No, I know, but they kind of correlated, right? Yeah, yeah. The more people that wanted to come, the lower percentage devs somehow. Well, I kind of remember at 2 they had DevCon, and then, like, next to it they had, like...

**[381.6s] SPEAKER_01:**
I think it was called like World Blockchain. Yeah, I mean, that one was a combined event. But yeah, I guess probably DevCon 3 probably in 2017 was the switch over where you had like a thousand people. So it switched from a, you know, meet your peers, talk about all the different development projects going on to more of a, you know, hey, here are the big talks and, you know, whoo. But yeah, we're on to, we have seven now. So, you know, DevCon 7 was in Bangkok last October, I think. But yeah, they started doing DevConnect as well, which is really intended, I guess, to not be a conference, to be a collection of different events connecting developers and community. So I was expecting it to be a fair bit smaller, but it absolutely wasn't. But it did have a different flavor to DevCon in that you it was lots of little things you know lots of many events many under that same banner obviously side events as well but even if you just got like a ticket for the main thing with a theme of World Fair, you know, of really, you know, bringing people from around the world to show what they're they're working on. But I didn't expect it to be as big. Like, I think it probably was as big as DevCon really in the numbers. I mean, I really yeah, I mean, effectively, I think they've become the same. It's just, you know, basically

**[483.3s] SPEAKER_03:**
whatever they were trying to kind of keep it small and more developer friendly it's and but i think you know in terms of signal-to-noise ratio these dev cons are probably still the highest compared to more businessy conferences you know what i mean like in terms of actual getting some technical stuff Jim what were your impressions of devconnect and uh buenos aires you can i've i've heard you said you're worried about being too negative but

**[510.5s] SPEAKER_00:**
There is no... Go for it. Yes. I mean, there was a lot of good stuff down there. First of all, I actually in part to avoid having a huge flight down there, I broke up multiple destinations down South America on the way there. Saw a lot of really cool stuff in Central and South America the week before. And Argentina is beautiful. Conference itself had some very cool things there, but I think I really sort of preferred the format of what happened in Bangkok the year before. There were certain things about the format here that were sort of made it difficult. First thing is that there was less going on at the main venue and we had to like spend a lot of time sort of like signing up for all these offsite things. And these offsite things were like big and would go on for hours. So sort of pull you away from the main event for the whole day. Maybe you could kind of come back at the end of the day. But then I tried that a little bit at first, like, you know, I signed up for like an offsite thing and then I kind of came back and, and once I got to the main event, you're sort of just wandering around and it was, it was hard. I, you know, maybe did you guys like find a good schedule for what was happening right there? Because mostly I was just walking around and there was one area, I guess it was the yellow pavilion where the big room was, and you could get a couple small talks there, but mostly it was just sort of

**[616.0s] SPEAKER_04:**
like outdoor study areas and not as much going on in the main area. I don't know. What did you guys think about that break apart? It was haphazard,
