**[2.2s] SPEAKER_00:** We are on. And welcome, everyone, to our recap of DevConnect Argentina. I’m Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato, CPO. Maybe I may be looking very robotic, so if I am, then yeah.

**[28.0s] SPEAKER_01:** C, 3pm.

**[31.9s] SPEAKER_00:** So let’s go around the horn and introduce ourselves before we kick it off. Karen, you want to go?

**[36.9s] SPEAKER_02:** Sure. I’m Kieren. I’m our CEO, I guess. Okay. So Strato, we have been—I guess we’re hard announcing it now—we are the labs company, if you will, that has always been called BlockApps, and I’m actually the CEO of BlockApps as we’re transitioning to a mainnet, open-source kind of foundation-given project. First we called that STRATO Mercata, because Mercata was sort of a separate product, and we’ve kind of purposefully sunset everything else. So going back to the OG Strato at this time. So I guess I’m the Strato CEO. Like, yeah, we’re jumping in with two feet.

**[83.5s] SPEAKER_03:** Victory.

**[84.0s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, exactly. Well, I was kind of soft-pedaling it, but I didn’t know if you want to make the announcement there. That’s cool.

**[90.8s] SPEAKER_02:** Well, but you said “Strato,” so it was too late.

**[95.0s] SPEAKER_00:** I think I’ve already changed it in my mind. So maybe it’s not like—and thanks for that, Bob.

**[102.2s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that’s it. OG, OG. So Strato was unveiled at Devcon 1. I don’t know what exact date that was. It might be almost exactly 10 years, like right now.

**[119.0s] SPEAKER_00:** I think it’s very close to 10 years.

**[120.7s] SPEAKER_02:** I think it was early December, maybe a week off.

**[123.6s] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, I think it was in October or November, because it wasn’t that cold, and it was in London, and I remember it was not miserable yet—which is normal in London at that time.

**[136.0s] SPEAKER_01:** So I will keep looking off to the side, but—

**[138.6s] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. You’re our resident historian, Bob.

**[142.7s] SPEAKER_02:** I see a YouTube video: December 11, 2015. Now those—

**[146.6s] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah.

**[147.0s] SPEAKER_01:** No, later though. They got released.

**[148.4s] SPEAKER_02:** Posted later.

**[149.3s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, well, Bob—do you want to do a quick—who are you?

**[156.5s] SPEAKER_01:** So hi, I’m head of ecosystem. So yeah, joined the team this year. But, you know, long-time friend.

**[166.0s] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. Long-time listener, first-time caller, right? And Jim, who are you?

**[173.9s] SPEAKER_03:** I am James from Strato. I am CTO of BlockApps and one of the three founders.

**[180.6s] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, and of Strato too, as Kieren has announced. So let’s dive right into it.

**[187.5s] SPEAKER_03:** We—

**[187.8s] SPEAKER_00:** What were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires? Who wants to start here?

**[208.5s] SPEAKER_02:** I guess I can. Quickly. Hopefully quickly. I know we all have a tendency to ramble.

**[213.6s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[213.8s] SPEAKER_02:** So one of my big surprises, let’s say—the city itself. I was surprised to find that I was in Europe. I was expecting to be in South America. And I guess everyone knows this—they call it like the Paris of South America or something. But quite a beautiful place. The mix of the food varied from really excellent—especially on the steak front. That is all true. If anyone is on the fence about Argentinian steak, go and try it. Medium, sometimes. Service: very slow. The city does not look that big. Somehow all of the hotels near the venue were booked out, so I ended up staying about 20 minutes away by car. And if there’s no traffic, it was like nine to 12 minutes away, but it was consistently about 25 minutes away because it’s all kind of like mid-rises—like four to six or eight stories—and it’s like that for a pretty large geographic area, which I found quite interesting. Yeah, it had a little bit of an old-world feel. It’s kind of narrow, but yeah, super cool. People are very nice. Maybe except for the slow service. It wasn’t like snooty slow service, it was just slow service. So it’s hard to get things. You had to budget more time than you expected for things, which we found out the hard way, but would go back. Very cool place.

**[310.9s] SPEAKER_00:** And what about DevConnect itself? How did you feel about the conference? And you might want to mention—yeah—what was the reaction to prices tanking during the event itself?

**[322.7s] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I’ll tell you the other thing that we should mention first is what DevConnect even is.

**[326.8s] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah. So as our resident historian of all things Ethereum, what is DevConnect?

**[334.6s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so it’s a major conference held by the Ethereum Foundation. There’s actually two different conference series that run now. So Devcon, which was originally developer conference, obviously has become not a developer conference anymore. I don’t know when it was last a developer conference. Maybe Devcon 2-ish.

**[358.9s] SPEAKER_02:** Maybe it kept getting bigger. Big, but not huge.

**[365.1s] SPEAKER_01:** I’m thinking in terms of the content though, you know.

**[367.7s] SPEAKER_02:** No, I know, but they kind of correlated, right? Like the more people that wanted to come, the lower percentage devs somehow.

**[375.1s] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I can’t remember: at 2 they had Devcon, and then next to it they had—I think it was called like World Blockchain?

**[383.9s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I mean that one was a combined event. Yeah. I guess probably Devcon 3, probably in 2017, was the switch-over where you had like a thousand people. So it switched from a “meet your peers, talk about all the different development projects going on” to more of a, you know, “hey, here are the big talks.” But yeah, we’re on to—we have seven now. So Devcon 7 was in Bangkok last October, I think. But yeah, they started doing Devconnects as well, which is really intended, I guess, to not be a conference, to be a collection of different events connecting developers and community. So I was expecting it to be a fair bit smaller, but it absolutely wasn’t. But it did have a different flavor to Devcon in that it was lots of little things, lots of many events under that same banner—obviously side events as well. But even if you just got a ticket for the main thing with a theme of “World Fair,” really bringing people from around the world to show what they’re working on. But I didn’t expect it to be as big. I think it probably was as big as Devcon, really, in the numbers.

**[475.0s] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, effectively, I think they become the same. It’s just—whatever they were trying to do to kind of keep it small. But I think, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, these Devcons are probably still the highest compared to more businessy conferences, you know what I mean? In terms of actually getting some technical stuff. Jim, what were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires? I’ve heard you say you’re worried about being too negative, but there is no—yeah, yeah, go for it.

**[513.1s] SPEAKER_02:** Please, Victor wants to know.

**[515.0s] SPEAKER_03:** Yes. I mean, there was a lot of good stuff down there. First of all, I actually—in part to avoid having a huge flight down there—I broke up multiple destinations down South America on the way there. So saw a lot of really cool stuff in Central and South America the week before. And Argentina is beautiful. Conference itself had some very cool things there. But I think I really sort of preferred the format of what happened in Bangkok the year before. There were certain things about the format here that made it difficult. First thing is that there was less going on at the main venue, and we had to spend a lot of time signing up for all these offsite things. And these offsite things were like big and would go on for hours. So it would sort of pull you away from the main event for the whole day. Maybe you could kind of come back at the end of the day. But then I tried that a little bit at first. Like, you know, I signed up for an offsite thing and then I kind of came back, and once I got to the main event you’re sort of just wandering around. It was hard. Did you guys find a good schedule for what was happening right there? Because mostly I was just walking around. There was one area—I guess it was the yellow pavilion—where the big room was and you could get a couple small talks there. But mostly it was just sort of like outdoor study areas and not as much going on in the main area. I don’t know. What did you guys think about that break-apart?

**[623.2s] SPEAKER_02:** It was haphazard. But I liked a bunch of the main stage talks. There were a few good ones on the Friday. There were good opening ones. And then there was a little amphitheater that had some of the good DeFi app talks. But I agree, it was sort of like a crapshoot. The registration procedures—sometimes you had to register for an event that was inside the venue. Sometimes that wouldn’t work, but you would go by the booth or whatever and they would just tell you, “Oh yeah, just don’t worry, just show up.” So it contributed to an impression of never quite knowing. Agendas weren’t really posted for any of these side events. They were not even really posted for the main event until like the night before. They were kind of, you know—lazily, I mean, in the computer science sense—updating the agendas as you went, so to speak. So it was very hard to come in with a target and hit everything with that target. You kind of had to just go with the flow. It doesn’t feel optimal. But I still got quite a lot out of it.

**[702.1s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[702.4s] SPEAKER_02:** Even with that. But yeah, the endless registrations were quite annoying. And yeah, there were big side events in the event, small ones. Like I discovered a couple days in, there was a quite large Polygon side event in the main venue. Yeah, yeah. It was sort of hard to—

**[726.2s] SPEAKER_00:** Well—

**[728.6s] SPEAKER_03:** Because everything was right there together, and you can kind of walk to—

**[731.6s] SPEAKER_02:** Something else that could be way better.

**[733.3s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[734.5s] SPEAKER_03:** You could kind of test something out, and if it was looking silly, you could just run out and find another room. So it allowed you to kind of—I don’t know—it’s like looking for a movie on Netflix or something. You can try a bunch of movies and then settle on one, versus the olden days where you had to buy a ticket to go to a theater, and if you bet wrong, you’re out of luck. That’s what a lot of this felt like. I would sign up for some event and then that would be like half an hour drive out of the main event. And by the time things would start, if it hit me I was into something silly, I’d still be like, “Well, maybe I should stay a little bit longer. I did sign up for this, and I can’t sign up for another thing right now.” So—main area, I hit a couple good ones there, but often the topic wasn’t something I was interested in at the moment.

**[788.6s] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I found what was kind of strange was that you signed up for these large blocks of time and then the agenda wouldn’t be clear when you were signing up, right? And then you might see one good talk in that. Some of them lasted like nine to five. So you get one good talk in there, and then people—

**[811.2s] SPEAKER_02:** Were just hanging out, like co-working and having coffee and whatever for most of it. And the talks were in this tight segment that they didn’t name until much later.

**[821.9s] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly. And some of the more important—like Vitalik saying something—and then the rest of it were hit-or-miss afterwards, right?

**[830.9s] SPEAKER_02:** So it was like, I tended to find out about Vitalik speaking by seeing that he was speaking.

**[839.1s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And then he’s coming on and like—yeah.

**[844.2s] SPEAKER_03:** And I kind of would have liked to have seen that too. But the thing is, I had signed up for a thing and I was across town when Kieren mentioned, “Hey, Vitalik’s speaking here now.” And I’m like, well—that was the day that I probably chose unwisely too. I wasn’t happy with the talks I had gone to.

**[865.7s] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Well, and speaking of that, maybe we can touch upon some of the big themes of DevConnect. Let’s start with the headline thing about Vitalik saying elliptic curves are going to die. That seemed to make a lot of news. And quantum computing was coming for us all. What were your thoughts on that? It’s a Jim question, I guess. Let’s start with Jim. Bring out that physics background. Jim.

**[893.7s] SPEAKER_03:** I’ll pass this to Kieren.

**[897.3s] SPEAKER_02:** Okay, so I will say that both Jim and I have a physics background, but mine was more from the math side, where we’re good at the beauty of the equations but don’t necessarily have it as an intuitive sense of like—the physics people were good at estimating the answer and then back-working into the actuality of it. Where the math people might actually be better at the math side, though the physicists are quite good at it, but less so. So nevertheless, I had spent some time in quantum and the machinery on how quantum computers might work and so on. I still don’t have that much evidence that it’s coming soon. But would you really? I don’t know. It’s hard to keep secrets under wraps. I think probably governments and private sector researchers are putting a bunch of money into it. But for a long time there were these like: Google got it to 20 qubits and they stayed together for 10^-7 seconds instead of 10^-9, and it computed the divisors of 63 or whatever—something like that, right? So yeah, I mean, I don’t know how we would know when quantum’s coming. Like, these coins are stolen. But even then, you might not want to do that. I also think the cryptography tends to come back pretty fast when new cryptanalytic tools come in. Like I believe there’s already quantum-resistant stuff. It’ll be a hard switch-over. But once you knew that the Bitcoin were still getting stolen, you might still have—like, I don’t know how—do you steal them all in one 10-minute segment? Or is it still kind of slow and you have a little bit of time to migrate over? Or you just snapshot all the balances at one date when you’re pretty sure that—I don’t know how we would deal with it. And yeah, I guess I’m often skeptical, but color me a little skeptical on quantum happening much faster than people expect, which is the real scenario you’re worried about.

**[1041.6s] SPEAKER_03:** It’s one of those stories that’s always in the news: “Oh, was there some big breakthrough or progress in quantum computing? It’s coming in a couple years.” But that’s what they’ve been saying for decades now.

**[1055.6s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, and it seems like a bunch of people are—I mean, I would say quantum resistance was a big theme. There were a lot of people claiming either research or advances in quantum resistance at the conference as well. So it seems like Ethereum is probably better situated to implement quantum resistance. I mean, it would be painful, but it would be very hard to do it on Bitcoin, more structurally, I think, than—Bitcoin changes less. Yeah, exactly. But what do you think, Bob? What was your impression of that?

**[1094.8s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. You can’t really tell when the thing’s coming up. But I’m not worried, really. Everyone’s talking about it. It’ll be fine. Everyone’s very aware.

**[1106.0s] SPEAKER_00:** It’s a known problem that a bunch of people are working at, but it’s unknown when it’s going to hit us, I guess, is the way I’d put it.

**[1114.6s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, honestly, there are chains that have already got quantum-resistant stuff. It just seems to be like a cost thing from what I can see. It’s probably not a problem, so why would we make ourselves less competitive now? Like, I don’t think it’s a market winner to say, “Oh yeah, we’re 10x slower, but we’re resistant.”

**[1138.6s] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[1141.8s] SPEAKER_01:** But it’s obviously an incoming matter. Though the hotter matter really is privacy. I think that’s really—

**[1149.2s] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I think the hot—the other thing in between those two things is ZK. So maybe we can—Bob, I know you have some thoughts on that. Maybe we can start with you this time.

**[1159.8s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so I mean, talking about where we went, I was mainly just in the main venue, with the exception of the day before the main event where we had the second Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress, which is a good fun event. And the other thing that there was on the final day was the Ethereum Privacy Stack event. So both of them were organized by Web3Privacy Now, and the second one in collaboration with the privacy guys at the Ethereum Foundation. So that is a pretty new group, I think about 50 people working on that at the EF.

**[1203.3s] SPEAKER_02:** 50 people, wow. Yes, a lot of ETH. Good. I mean, good for them. Wow.

**[1210.0s] SPEAKER_01:** So, yeah, you know, pretty serious, and in multiple different areas. So they’ve got the Kotaku project, which basically seems to be like an SDK and tooling to help with integration of privacy features into wallets—using existing projects, with Railgun being a key one. Basically like, “Hey, here’s how to plug privacy into an existing wallet, and we’ve kind of done most of the work.”

**[1241.0s] SPEAKER_03:** Also—

**[1243.6s] SPEAKER_01:** On that: one of the major main talks that there was on that last day was Vitalik and Roger Dingledine—great name—of Tor, really talking about the Tor-ification of Ethereum, which is planned. So that was a bit of a reveal that there is work underway to look at all of the different levels and components of that protocol stack and work out how to unify them, really, or at least make them Tor-friendly, including things like the block formation and the validator leader stuff, and hiding all of that.

**[1293.9s] SPEAKER_02:** I want to jump in quickly on the Congress. I want to hate a little bit first. Okay. The infinite garden appeared on the screen again.

**[1302.8s] SPEAKER_01:** Like DevConnect, you mean? Sorry—no, no.

**[1306.5s] SPEAKER_02:** On the Cypherpunk Congress. I’m not sure you saw that one.

**[1308.6s] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, okay.

**[1309.6s] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I took a picture of it for the record—put it in the show notes. We’re like halfway to a wartime EF, but we’ve kept the old generals and put them on the National Guard or something—the Coast Guard. And let me connect this to sort of a broader point. I really liked that you saw a bunch of the old faces at DevConnect—people who have been around for a long time. Like when I watched the Sky and Uniswap talks—Sky has always formerly been MakerDAO—I’m against this rebrand, but they seem to really take being a DAO seriously, where a lot of DAOs is sort of marketing and you kind of don’t—you know, it’s led pretty top-down. But they were up there talking about the DAO way of doing things. And they’ve got proposals that you vote on. And I’m sure it’s still a little bit oligarchic, but they really meant it—the DAO part on some level. I was talking to a cool guy who I need to follow up with, actually, with Victor. And we’re showing him the app on the phone, and he was like, “Oh, are you getting a full node on there?” I was like, “No.” Like, those days, we’ve given up on this dream. I think it’s like: the thing needs to be fast, and you’re not going to run the node on the phone, even if you could. It’s gonna melt. Maybe one day—maybe the tech on the watch. Yes, node on the watch. Exactly. On the Apple Watch.

**[1427.1s] SPEAKER_03:** But—

**[1428.2s] SPEAKER_02:** So I’m making fun of it a little bit, but I like that these people still exist. And it’s like 2017, 2015—the same things. And in that same conversation, we’re talking to an old friend of ours. He’s like, “Yeah, Railgun, it’s great, but I want it to go harder. I want there to be one account for the whole network that all activity goes under, and then you use your ZK receipts to pull out what’s specific to you.” But all that’s like: hell yeah, let’s go hardcore dreamer, cypherpunk. And almost no other conferences are like that. I haven’t been to a big Solana builder conference, but I assume those are pretty commercial, just from the whole Solana ecosystem ethos. I’m surprised these people are still around, but this is great. So I wanted to throw a plug out that if you’re on crypto Twitter too much, you worry that literally everything about the industry is price action, and there are still some true believers. It’s kind of the same people that it was somewhere between 2015 and 2017.

**[1497.6s] SPEAKER_01:** Lefteris did a good tweet, a good little video clip actually. Because Lefteris—famously one of those OG builders with Rotki portfolio management software that he has as his main product, being offline, you know, so it’s a local app. He had a good new phrase as well, which was “aligned apps,” with that alignment being with you, the user, not some weird Ethereum alignment or anything, but saying it’s on your side. But the tweet that he had was: one of the terrible things was the network. The Wi-Fi was just wrecked, like many of the days. Like, nothing—even data on your phone—because there’s so many people doing it at the same time. But he did a little video saying, “The network’s down, but my app still runs.”

**[1564.8s] SPEAKER_03:** Look—

**[1568.6s] SPEAKER_00:** But I will say—on that kind of—I would not to push back against what you’re saying, but I do think the privacy people have kind of gotten more customer-aligned than purely philosophical-aligned. Like in the Ethereum Privacy Summit, I heard many times: “Yes, we want consumer privacy. No, we don’t want to support North Korea or pedophiles.” Which seems to be the right line to draw. You know? It’s like, I think it’s—

**[1600.4s] SPEAKER_02:** Well, okay, there’s a debate. Bob, do you want to jump in? I ran into Amin during the conference who seems to have created this debate. You might have more context on it than I do. But I’ll back Phil if need be.

**[1615.9s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, sure. So I guess specifically there you have this philosophical question of: if you do have a privacy tech, should that be unconditionally, you know, single anonymity set with the whole world? Obviously the larger anonymity set that you have, the better security you have, with the ideal being it’s everything—it’s all transactions for everything. So I mean, that’s the scenario that you have with Monero. Monero is using ring signatures at the moment. There are plans for use of ZK—it’s a full membership proof thing that they’ve got proposed. But right now it’s just ring sigs. But it’s on by default, you know, so privacy on by default, mixing with everything by default. On the other side, on Zcash, for example, you can have transparent transactions or you can go into the different shielded pools. The one that you’re talking about in particular is Privacy Pools. Privacy Pools I think was either a suggestion from Vitalik or Vitalik was one of many.

**[1714.0s] SPEAKER_02:** He’s on the paper.

**[1715.2s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah. A number of co-authors. But I mean, Soleimani is a primary guy, and Zach Cole as well. They just did a raise at Oxbow, which I believe raised three and a half million.

**[1730.8s] SPEAKER_02:** But the approach is quite a responsible number in the—

**[1735.4s] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. It’s maybe about how much it might cost to develop the technology and—

**[1740.3s] SPEAKER_02:** A little bit more.

**[1742.4s] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, the approach there—and it was really in reaction to the legal action on Tornado Cash—was really saying, “Okay, well if you do this blind privacy approach, you do intermingle yourself with North Korea and terrorists and crime.”

**[1767.6s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[1768.2s] SPEAKER_01:** And the Monero reaction to that is yes.

**[1776.0s] SPEAKER_02:** So let me—let me—but if—

**[1779.1s] SPEAKER_01:** You can back up. Sorry, just to finish the thought there. So yeah, really a primary thing was not wanting to have that association, but also not wanting developers to go to jail. And saying: if you can credibly show, “Look, here is a ZK proof that shows that I am not in the same group as these known baddies,” then that’s a kind of responsible middle ground. It does affect your anonymity set, but maybe not that much.

**[1812.3s] SPEAKER_02:** Let me add maybe the flip-side argument, but also. So I’m never a user of any of these technologies. I’m sure I will test some at the minimum amounts at some point. Tornado Cash—terrible name. I believe that it actually also contained a capability, at least, to prove source of funds on one side. So you could prove that your funds were acquired legitimately, even if they were obscured later. I don’t think you can do a severability with the bad funds. And that’s the key point that Amin was telling me is the difference. But the counterfactual—what the hardcore other-side cypherpunks would say—is something like, “Well, what about cash? All cash is dirty. It’s all been used in some bathroom to get some illegal substance from point A to point B. It’s really the preferred technology for certain kinds of money laundering.” And all that sort of thing. There are serial numbers, I guess, but we don’t go and say cash is the problem. And the anonymity set of cash includes lots of bad acts, right? And so this kind of presumption of guilt—like, you know, if you’re putting your money in the pool, you’re aiding and abetting North Korean money laundering—I don’t buy it at all. And on the other side, you don’t want to cede that argument. And everywhere in the world is trying to cede that argument. The banking system definitely has a guilty-by-default ethos: prove everything about you, and we’re going to surveil every transaction, and we’ll tell you if you’re allowed to bank, basically.

**[1945.8s] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, I think there’s certainly a very valid argument on that side of sort of like this supposition of you going, “But it wasn’t me, sir. Here’s my ZK proof, I promise.” What’s the ZK proof? Like, what are you even talking about?

**[1964.4s] SPEAKER_02:** Exactly. So if you pick this half-step, you’re kind of just saying: “Oh, you use this privacy tech,” but you’re one of the easy ones to pick off. I don’t know.

**[1975.8s] SPEAKER_01:** And it makes it a permission system again.

**[1978.6s] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[1978.9s] SPEAKER_01:** And you could say, “Oh, it’s only a bit.” But yeah, talking to Zach, it was really—

**[1985.5s] SPEAKER_02:** I don’t know the details. Amin said it does break the fungibility, which is kind of a way of the same thing. It’s like with Bitcoin you have tainted ones and not.

**[1997.2s] SPEAKER_01:** But talking to Zach, it seemed a primary motivation wasn’t so much being compliant as it was: “We don’t want any more of our friends to go to jail.”

**[2006.8s] SPEAKER_02:** Totally. Yeah, I guess.

**[2009.1s] SPEAKER_01:** And maybe that’s a passing phase.

**[2013.0s] SPEAKER_02:** It’s that these—

**[2014.6s] SPEAKER_03:** Yes.

**[2015.1s] SPEAKER_02:** At the same time, I don’t really know what the Tornado Cash people did other than build software. Could have been more than building the software. There’s no way that building some software should count as a conspiracy to launder some money like that. That’s never applied in any other case, really. Maybe. Except as regards the crypto industry.

**[2043.4s] SPEAKER_01:** Also worth saying though, I think, is that many parts of the world are not so progressive as the US on that matter.

**[2050.1s] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[2052.1s] SPEAKER_00:** Well, Jim, I think we’re starting to get—we’re a little bit over 30 minutes. Want to kind of touch base with you. I know you’re still pretty jet-lagged. What were your impressions at the conference, especially since you attended a lot of agentic AI talks too? So, you know, how real is that? What do you think about whether—what were your big takeaways from the conference?

**[2078.7s] SPEAKER_03:** Well, I was pretty excited to go to anything AI, but I don’t know—we’re sort of in the hype part of the hype cycle right now. And I went, on the first day, to one where multiple—I don’t know—it was like typical people speaking would be somebody who had put together a company where they were using AI to maybe go and do DeFi trading or something like that. And it would holistically understand what’s happening in the world and try to use that to trade. There were panels of people where it was multiple people with a variant of that story. And it was all very inspirational sounding and a little bit light on the details, but everybody was very excited by it. But I’m sitting there listening, and I’m like: there’s no way that this stuff is really cool. There’s no way they’re doing it, though. And I remember it would be a much bigger deal if some of these succeeded. And it’s funny because at these events you can still have a lot of marketers there, but there’s still enough geeks there that sometimes people just blurt out honest things. And after hearing lots of marketing speak, I forget who it was—and I probably wouldn’t say who it was anyway—but one guy, they had been spinning up this whole story again, like I had said before, but they were like, “Oh, and this actually works.” And he got a little too honest and he was like, “Oh, if this thing actually worked, you think I’d be sitting here right now?” And so that was sort of the theme to me: overpromising some really cool ideas, but it didn’t look like it was actually working. And this is kind of the case in AI in general right now. There’s huge breakthroughs. AI can do a lot of stuff that would have shocked me just a few years ago. But it’s hard to get them to actually complete the whole job for you, or actually work as advertised. So that’s the common theme I was seeing there in these talks.

**[2227.3s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[2227.7s] SPEAKER_01:** Did you see anything with post-apps? Any kind of post-app sort of like, “Hey look, you can just AI-drive this,” and that kind of text or voice interface as opposed to UI?

**[2247.9s] SPEAKER_02:** I’m confused.

**[2248.6s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[2249.1s] SPEAKER_01:** What’s a post-applications? Right. You know, soon we won’t have applications. We’ll just be talking.

**[2254.0s] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, post-apps, yes.

**[2255.9s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Was it more infrastructure stuff that you were seeing?

**[2263.8s] SPEAKER_03:** It looked like infrastructure stuff, what I heard. But there were many, many groups up there talking about it.

**[2269.6s] SPEAKER_02:** The trading bots are arguably post-apps. I mean, you kind of probably tell them what to do and they, theoretically, give you more money than you had when you gave it to them. It’s like a little financial manager. But I think I’ve said before: when I’ve test-driven Claude and told it to go do a swap on our testnet, it can do it. But it goes pretty slow through the UI. It’s understanding it visually. I don’t know that it’s that much easier than a human. But I think you could mostly give a declarative intention to an AI. Like, “Hey, I want to rebalance from Bitcoin into Bitcoin and ETH.” Well, they can do it, but it’s not like—you know—sorry, go, Jim.

**[2321.8s] SPEAKER_03:** Well, I guess there is a subtle distinction between an agent and a helper, or just using AI as the UI, versus an autonomous agent. That’s the stuff that seems not quite baked to me yet. But I saw a couple talks where people were talking about just using it in place of the existing UIs that are out there right now, to help you each step of the way do things. And that probably is great. We all sort of use AI in that kind of thing right now.

**[2357.5s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I did hear a very interesting talk by the people formerly Infura, but now DIN—Decentralized Infrastructure Network—who are talking about really thinking about AI agents as users and how to make it easier for them to interact with the network. So from that point of view, I do think that there’s some—I don’t think it’s really replacing UX. I think it’s more targeting a different class of user entirely: agents.

**[2387.4s] SPEAKER_02:** Let me add to that. For a long time I’ve been worried about our mobile story. During the conference, I was using our app on mobile a bunch, and while I’m still worried about it, I think in many cases it will be leapfrogged by just like, “Hey, chat, go do this thing in this app for me.”

**[2408.6s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[2409.4s] SPEAKER_02:** And there’s a downside to that, in that we have yet another aggregator, but an upside in that you might not have to make a really slick mobile app. And I think that’ll continue. And I do—I don’t use that pattern much yet, but it’s something we should definitely lean into. And I’ve also seen pretty funny things. Some B2B SaaS Twitter handle made some post, was like, “Yeah, we sold the enterprise our app. We wanted them to use it more, so we made an AI to use it for them, and they’re using it more.” Whoa.

**[2453.7s] SPEAKER_00:** What you described, though—I heard the MetaMask team, they’re really talking about intents. Like trying to kind of—rather than making you do a lot of clicks—just tell it, “Okay, this is what I’m trying to achieve,” and then “find me the best savings,” right? And then we’ll go and do all of that stuff. I know we’re over time, so I want to go around the horn and say: what is the biggest takeaway you got from this DevConnect? Let’s start with you, Karen.

**[2484.5s] SPEAKER_02:** Privacy seems much more viable now than I thought. I’ve been generally a skeptic, even us having worked on it a bunch, but I think there are pretty solid mainnet, live use cases for it that work now that we could also incorporate. I honestly think if we’re talking about consumer mass adoption, you can’t really have these cleartext balances. Yes, it’s pseudonymous, but it makes everybody uncomfortable. Like Bob is fond of quoting the time when very obviously one of the Ethereum core devs moved like a quarter billion dollars into Binance or whatever. It’s like—it’s not. So I’ve tried to accelerate our privacy roadmap in response.

**[2537.9s] SPEAKER_00:** Jim, what was your big takeaway from this conference?

**[2542.0s] SPEAKER_03:** Well, the coolest thing that I saw, if it’s real, is ZK is also one of these things which is prone to overhyping. But it seems like maybe scalability of Ethereum might be solved through some ZK means sometime in the next couple of years, if that really happens. You know, maybe I’ve heard something about that before, but I probably just ignored it. But people were talking about it like it’s around the corner right now. Looked into it a little bit. It looks—if it does what they say it does—it could be pretty impressive. So that was exciting to me.

**[2580.4s] SPEAKER_00:** Bob, what was the biggest takeaway for you?

**[2584.1s] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, and I think that’s true on a few different pieces. Both in terms of that privacy, but yeah, also scaling. Like I think some of these things have taken so long. Here we are 10 years in. I just looked: it was November 10th, by the way—the Strato talk. Congratulations.

**[2608.3s] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, exactly. Almost exactly.

**[2610.8s] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, some of these things have taken 10 years, really, to get where we thought we’d get in a few months, even. And yeah, I think that will be like the ZK-ification of the L1 that would basically end up with not really doing any execution on the L1. It’s just proofs of things that are happening up above in whatever execution environment that might be. So yeah, I’m feeling very—like we didn’t talk about the price action, but that does not at all, to my mind, reflect where we are on the tech, which I think it was a really positive checkpoint for me. Like, a lot of these things—yeah, we’re kind of really there, and things moving really fast. So if we look back in five years, say, or even three, I think we’re going to be in a great place where it’s like we’re almost feature-complete. Maybe.

**[2671.7s] SPEAKER_00:** Software is never really feature-complete, but I would say that I guess the biggest takeaway I had is: I think ZK proving—which is different than the compilation part—has come way faster and way down. Like last year when they were talking about it, I think a typical proof took minutes and required 48 GPUs. And now I’m seeing two GPUs and closer to kind of the 10-second real-time holy grail that we’re getting to. Like when I looked at the things on fproof.org, I was really impressed at how close it was and what people are doing there. So I think we’ll call it there because we’re already 15 minutes over. But where can we find you? I’m Victor Wong. You can find me at X, at VicForWong. W-O-N-G. Karen, where can we find you?

**[2720.2s] SPEAKER_02:** Kieren James-Lubin on X and most places.

**[2724.2s] SPEAKER_00:** Jim.

**[2726.8s] SPEAKER_03:** Still Twitter, and I’ve also forgotten my handle again. I should probably—you should remind me next time to look it up. It’s—what is it? John—John Feed Hormuz or something.

**[2738.0s] SPEAKER_02:** I looked it up, but I can’t—I looked like two weeks ago.

**[2740.5s] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, I’m gonna keep asking you. You’re good. This is a weekly pop quiz for you, Jim. So you better learn it.

**[2749.6s] SPEAKER_01:** Look at the notes on our website. I always like do the link. I always reply to that and correct it. And yeah, so I’m Bob Summerwill—summer like the season, and will like “I’ll write your will.”

**[2762.9s] SPEAKER_00:** On Twitter. And thank you for joining us. Take care.

**[2767.0s] SPEAKER_03:** I’m looking at my handle right now. It’s—it’s Jamshid Hormuz.

**[2771.7s] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, you get a 50. Just pass.

**[2777.7s] SPEAKER_03:** That’s even more embarrassing than failing.
