#### [00:01] SPEAKER_01 (block 1/104)

**Intermediate:**

> We are on, and welcome everyone to our recap of DevConnect Argentina. I'm Victor Wong, founder and CPO at Strato.

**opus:**

**gemini:**

> I mean, effectively, I think they've become the same. It's just, you know, basically whatever they were trying to kind of keep it small and more developer-friendly. But I think, you know, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, these DevCons are probably still the highest compared to more business-y conferences, you know what I mean? Like in terms of actual getting some technical stuff. Jim, what were your impressions of DevConnect and Buenos Aires? I've heard you said you're worried about being too negative, but... There is no... Go for it.

#### [18:26] SPEAKER_01 (block 53/104)

**Intermediate:**

> It's a known problem that a bunch of people are working at it. But no, it's unknown when it's going to hit us, I guess is the way I put it. Yeah.

#### [34:12] SPEAKER_01 (block 79/104)

**Intermediate:**

> Well, Jim, I think we're starting to get, you know, we're a little bit over 30 minutes. I wanted to kind of touch base with you. I know you're still pretty jet lagged on what were your impressions at the conference, especially since you attended a lot of agentic AI talks too. So, you know, how real is that? What do you think about whether, what were your big takeaways from the conference?
