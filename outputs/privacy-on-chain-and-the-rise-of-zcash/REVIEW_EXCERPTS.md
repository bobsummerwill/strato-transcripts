I am founder and chief product officer at blockapps. I'll get to our normal guests, but today we have. Jim, do you want to give us a quick intro?

> Yes, but what's the whole acronym? But so there is a way I think to take an arbitrary computation and to prove that it has a certain result without revealing like the intermediate states and so on. But it's not computationally feasible. Like or it's just so slow that if you try to do it that way it becomes very difficult. So I believe just, just tying back to Jim's point, like you could try to do this in a generality. Like I can verify like the evm. Like I can verify there are these zkevms like I verify any computation that comes out of this thing. And I think the problem with them has been performance. And so the zcash people, I guess had to decompose every little step into specific circuits. Right. Like or. Yeah, it's very, very low level programming thinking in the ZK world. Like literally they're circuits that you end up compiling and so on and so forth.

**Intermediate:**

> technically worked, but were a business failure, I think is fair to say. And so, you know, the audience can learn from our like sort of failed mistakes in the past right now. But we sort of built, so we had heard years ago about CK, but we sort of just, I don't know, at the time looked into it and said like, oh, this looks like overly complicated. You can get privacy through these other means. And we ended up building a system that that allowed for sort of like quick spin up of private chains that everything was sort of like in an encrypted tunnel and you could have like these chains completely secure and nobody else would see what was happening there. But long story short, you know, slow learning process. We found out that customers want everything and to the point that it made it worthless. Like we would go into enterprise, we would say like, oh, you can set up these private channels with others. And they loved that because they could sort of control that and they could control who goes in there. But then once everything was going through these private channels, then they wanted to be able to like transfer from private chain to private chain. And that's where everything started to fall apart. And getting things back onto the main chain became sort of this extra complicated system. And at the same time customers wanted to have like a full flexibility in having like extensions to solidity where you could just like name a chain and send some money from chain A to chain B. And really the only way to make that stuff work is you have to go back to ZK. So ZK is overly complicated, but it is necessary. And so, We started looking at that again, but I think like the safe thing to do is start with a proven technology and Zcash had been around for years and nobody had stolen money. And this is just sort of like a subset of ZK, but it's kind of a cool thing. You can build what they call tumblers of money. You throw a bunch of money in and then the money that you put into the Tumblr is, you know how much went in, but the ownership is completely scrambled up. And at any time you can go and transfer money from within the Tumblr from one user to another, but only the users who did the transferring and got the money know what was there, but nobody else can see what's happening. So again, like you have these systems of multiple users with lots of money, but you don't know who owns a percentage of the money.

#### [19:56] SPEAKER_00 (block 15/29)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, Bob, you were saying something? Yeah, so Zcash is onto its fourth round of different cryptography. So I forget what they're called, Sapling, something else. We're onto Orchard now. But I mean, that's been now over the course of nearly a decade. You know, each time you've got another sort of two years worth of leading edge advancement. And... And yeah, like talking about that performance thing. So something which I think has been a key piece in Zcash price appreciation recently has been the arrival of a functional mobile wallet. So that's called Zashi, which is made by the... electric coin company, but you're basically at the point where you can run that proof on your phone. So something which used to be laptop seven minutes is now phone second. So what you've seen, if you look at the size of these shielding pools, where these pools are effectively like, you know, all of these things are all you know, mixed and hidden together, right? The more that you've got in a pool, the more, you know, the more unlinkable you are. If you have a, you know, if you do something simple like ring signatures where you're just whatever, I think Monero's got 16 transactions that, you know, get all joined together. So you can trace through that to a degree, but if you've got hundreds or thousands or millions of people in that same pool, it's effectively completely anonymous at that point. But if you look at the stats of usage of these particular pools, are you seeing what proportion of the money supply has been shielded versus being transparent? I guess that's another thing to say, right? Bitcoin is transparent, so same with Ethereum. But then they use the word shielded to talk about that you are within this anonymity set. So these earlier rounds, you had a bit of use, but not a ton of use. But right now, I can't find the view, but it was something like about four or five million of the 21 million were within that shielding pool. So a significant chunk of it is shielded now, which was never the case in the past. I remember on ETC at some point, we were looking at whether we were going to bring over the pre-compiles to do with some of the curves. I don't know if you remember that happened in Ethereum at some point, but one of the Blake curves, I think, went into the pre-compile. And we were talking about whether we were going to do that or not. And really talking about gas limit as well. How gas expensive would operations be using these things even? And the stats at that time were, you know, it's like maybe 2% of transactions on Zcash were shielded, something like that. You know, it's basically like not being used at all, you know, functionally pretty much identical to Bitcoin. But probably a lot of end users going, yeah, I'm using Zcash, I'm private. And it's like, yeah, you know, you're not at all. You're getting zero benefit at all.

And I think it's just these rounds and rounds and years and years of research and then implementation of those and engineering effort. And it's like, hey, it works now.

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, Jim, what do you think, like, you know, on the sort of general programmability ZK front? I wish I had more, you know, hands-on experience with general ZK. I see a lot of people very excited by it. And maybe in a way that makes me skeptical because it seems like a cool toy. But I am open to them working great.

You got to continue to push that down, but I think the ratio is very large. Well, I think we are at time. You know, where can we find you, Jim? I'm going to start with you. Where can you find me? Yes. People want to hear more and learn more about Jim, which I, you know, please speak up, ask him where can, where they find you.
