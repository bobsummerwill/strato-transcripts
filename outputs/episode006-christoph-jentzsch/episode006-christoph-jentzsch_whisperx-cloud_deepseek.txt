SPEAKER_08: Okay, recording is in progress. Hello everybody. Today I'm delighted to have Christoph Jentzsch with us. We did attempt to record this Christoph and I two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button. So we spoke for an hour or so and then it was not recorded. So this is round two. Hello Christoph, how are you?

SPEAKER_01: Hi Rob. Nice to meet you again. I'm doing good. I hope you too. Thanks for the invitation.

SPEAKER_08: Fantastic. So Christoph and I, our paths crossed for the first way back in 2015 when I was trying to do C++ Ethereum on my smartwatch. This was around the time that Christoph was still at the Ethereum Foundation. Then I think I crossed paths a number of times since, and Kieren too.

Indeed. So Christoph, what were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

SPEAKER_01: So the journey started in 2013. I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics, actually about self-organizing systems. So like biology, six months in mathematical biology and other things. I was studying systems which have local rules and global behavior. And I came across Bitcoin, which is just a small set of local rules and a global behavior as a currency.

But the reason I came... was I was looking for cheap GPUs, like graphic cards. And the Bitcoin miners were selling their GPU mining rigs to get some FPGAs and later ASICs. And so that's how I got into Bitcoin mining. And so I bought my first Bitcoin, got into this bubble, read everything I could about it. And then I came across the white paper from Vitalik early 2014, something like January, February in some Bitcoin forum somewhere.

And I was already totally in love with the idea of Bitcoin being a decentralized currency and all the characteristics and features of it. This white paper Vitalik, if you read it again, it's almost a prophecy. Except for NFTs, everything's in there — from DAOs, from ENS like names, domain names, the terms and all of that. So for me it opened up this option of building applications with the same characteristics as Bitcoin but just not a currency, but everything else.

So then I started reading everything about it. And in 2014, in summer, I read that the crowd sale was in 2014, right? Yeah. So around the time the crowd sale happened, I watched a video from Gavin Wood. He was somewhere in Scandinavia, some conference there in the Nordics. And he talked about Ethereum. I loved it. And he said they wanted to open up an office in Berlin looking for C++ developers. I was a C++ developer. So in theoretical physics, it's 90% software development. So I thought well, I want to do this.

So I took my parental leave time plus some vacation time and paused my PhD for like three to six months and said, I will return after I'm done. I thought this was just a short project because they raised money, maybe six, maybe 12 months, 18 months or so, then it's over. When I started, I thought maybe three to six months, and then I go back to my PhD. So I worked there with Ethereum, Gavin Wood, it was a great time, and then just decided to stay. It was so exciting.

So you never got to be a doctor? No, I'm not a doctor. I did not finish my PhD, although I only had six months left, which was kind of a pity. I worked for three years on that. But I also had at the time, I think four or five kids. I needed some money. I didn't get much money as a PhD student. So I did software development as a side hustle, basically.

And so when I got this project I said well let's do this for two or three months as a parental leave time then I can return. And then I decided to really interrupt my PhD thinking I would maybe return one year later because I thought the foundation would eventually run out of money because they're not making any profits. They just raised donations then they will spend them and then it's over. Then I can continue my PhD. That was originally the plan. Just came different.

I mean, I guess it's never too late, right? I actually sometimes think about if I should return. It's just so much to learn again. I'm right now doing tokenize it. I'm basically working on tokenizing German companies. It works very well. And so currently I'm not planning on getting back anytime soon.

No, because I mean, famously you had Dr. Gavin Wood and Dr. Christian Reitweissner as well. And I think there were a couple of other PhDs as well. There was definitely.

SPEAKER_04: I also dropped out of mine. I was actually in mathematical physics too. Similar background. Theoretical physics is the mathematical part of physics. I enjoyed it very much. I did thermodynamics and statistics, mostly software development. It was really fun. Well, by the way, Jim is trying to join.

SPEAKER_08: Yeah, he'll pop up and we can add him.

So Christoph, in terms of getting hired into f_dev, did you meet Gav at a meetup?

SPEAKER_01: Yes, actually I listened only to his talk. It was an online thing. I actually just wrote him an email, said, I would love to join Ethereum, love what you're doing. And he invited me to meet me in Kreuzberg, Berlin. So I went up there, met him. I remember the first conversation he was talking about all the stuff they were going to build and said, what can you do? And I just asked him, what's like the most complicated stuff you have right now? Give me a complicated task. I can figure it out.

So he talked about the Ethereum virtual machine which did some testing. So I just picked working on testing the Ethereum virtual machine, writing tests for it. Back at the time, I actually had no real idea what he was talking about. Meaning, of course, I did understand on the white paper level, I did understand what Ethereum was about. But Gavin had this skill of writing the yellow paper, which is still incredible work. It's such a great specification, different from Bitcoin, really having a specification. So multiple clients could be built.

In there he defined the Ethereum virtual machine. I think I read the paper six or seven times. I felt like I was one out of 10 or 20 people in the world at the time who really understood the yellow paper. I did corrections to it. I have some pull requests actually in the yellow paper GitHub repo, added missing definitions and stuff like that. And then what I mostly did was writing tests according to the specification, which then were with the help of the C++ client. So I was working also on the C++ code base.

And so Geth, PyEthereum, also the JavaScript version. And what else did we have? Haskell client and others. They're basically using my tests to see if they implemented the Ethereum machine correctly, also the state transitions and block creation correctly.

SPEAKER_08: Yeah, just to have some timeline for the viewers, Vitalik wrote the white paper in November 2013. Various other people joined in on the efforts in December, including Gavin and Jeff who started the C++ and Go clients respectively at the very end of December, kind of Christmas projects for them both.

January 2014, he had the public announcement of Ethereum at the Bitcoin Miami conference. It was as early as April 2014 that Gavin wrote the yellow paper, which is the formal specification. You had the crowd sale between July and September 2014. So then you were coming in right after that. You had a wave of arrivals in September and October of that year, essentially because the crowd sale had happened. There was some money to actually hire people.

And then talking about where you met initially, that group. f_dev was and is a company coordinating the development of Ethereum stuff, a subsidiary of the Ethereum Foundation. They were working initially in a co-working space but then got their own office. It was between August and November of that year that the office was getting done up and tidied. Then in November you had DevCon Zero, the first conference, an internal one.

Where a lot of the people, that was their first sort of face-to-face meetings.

SPEAKER_01: How was DevCon Zero? What was that like? It was like a company retreat. So it was not a public conference. Even though there were some outsiders who felt like part of the community, maybe also pushed some code. I remember Henning was there, who wrote the book about Ethereum.

Joseph Lubin was also there. Roman Adelaide with the Java clients. But it was mostly developers. But also, Stefan Tual was already there. He had the London team. So it was like an internal Ethereum meeting. Kind of a meetup almost. I think three days or so. Five days even. So it was a full week. I was there for the full week, as far as I can remember. I did a presentation about testing, how the test suite is very important.

Yes, we had Remix projects, Solidity project mostly started at the time. Gavin used this for explaining his vision of Ethereum as a platform for decentralized applications. Building Swarm. I don't know if Swarm was already launched there, but at least take the generic idea, the Ms. Browser.

So all those ideas are really sketched out there, like the technical roadmap, what we are going to build. Because we started just, of course, with the basic clients, implementing the protocol. But he took it like, what are we going to do in the next 12 months? Building the Ms. Browser, Remix, all those tools to have a platform for applications.

I remember one slide, which I think I posted on Twitter a while ago, where you have those three circles, one circle at one node, and you would see like they are connecting on the blockchain, using Swarm for the data, Whisper for the messages. This whole picture was painted there.

And there were people attending, I think around 50 people, plus minus 10, don't know the exact number, where most of the developers talking about code, coding there. Joseph, I remember him being there saying, well, all of you, you will create your own companies, becoming millionaires. I remember Joseph talking about that. And I think mostly he was right. So most of those people in the room...
