> Okay, recording is in. Pro is in progress. It says so. Hello everybody. Today. Delighted to have Christoph Jens with us. We did attempt to record this, Christoph and I, two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button. So we spoke for an hour or so and then it was not recorded. So this is round two. Hello Christoph, how are you?

> okay recording is in pro uh is in progress it says so hello everybody um today delighted uh to have uh christoph uh yance with us uh we did attempt to record this uh christoph and i two weeks ago but i forgot to press the record button so we spoke for an hour or so and then it was not recorded so this is uh round two so hello christoph how are you Hi, Rob. Nice to meet you again. I'm doing good. I hope you too. Thanks for the invitation. Fantastic, yeah. So Christoph and I, our paths crossed for the first time way back. back in 2015 when I was trying to do C++ Ethereum on my smartwatch. And this was around the time that Christoph was still at the Ethereum Foundation. And then I think I crossed paths across a number of times since, and Kieran's too. Indeed. So, Christoph, What were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

#### [21:02] SPEAKER_08 (block 20/79)

**Intermediate:**

> Well, yeah, there were like ten. Let's move on from sharing about video platforms. So so I look back. So so Jim's first commits on on the Haskell client were mid-September 2014. So, you know, a couple of months ahead of ahead of DEVCON zero that you'd have the yellow paper for for for for five months at that time. And I did find on our slack um you know a bit of a thread where where things I think from you Christoph were were being discussed by Jim I don't know did you guys interact directly at all on on testing Jim Christoph not directly not as far as I can remember I mean maybe there was some messages I mean it's about it has been a while ago

#### [38:13] SPEAKER_01 (block 40/79)

**Intermediate:**

> The problem with this is you only need it if you really need it. Meaning if Uniswap failed, the interface is not there. It's like a backup. But it's not what you want to use daily. And if you remember, maybe, Kiri, you were there at DEF CON 1. When they presented MetaMask, my first thought was oh this is totally away from the vision like how can you not run a full node how can you dare you like to just serve over rpc with infura like almost not a scam but it was like not what we intended to build today it's like this is a decentralized version of it this is like non-castor the metamask or the good guys compared to all the others. See how the view shifted over the years. Back then, it was absolutely required to run a full node if they missed browser. This is how it's done. And now we have MetaMask plus Infora. And today, this is really the version which is viewed as the original non-custodial Ethereum vision. how things are shifting, basically. But yes, you only need those things if things are falling apart. Just as an example, so many people use the Gnosis Safe. Let's say the Gnosis Safe UI is gone. Technically, it shouldn't be a problem to run another one, but there really needs to be something on IPFS, there needs to be something which can self-host, so I can still access my wallet without going to the command line. So for those reasons, you need it. And the mispronouncement was sort of as the fallback for every debt. Like, of course, you can have your application run on a normal.com domain on AWS, fine. But if you could serve the same app in a decentralized fashion as a backup, this would be great because you could still use it if the company gets a Uniswap, the company fails. If someone builds a nice Uniswap UI served by IPFS, directly interacting with the smart contracts.

**Intermediate:**

> It was a busy week. But it was just notable to me because at least from what I was seeing, it went from zero to one like overnight. I had never heard of it the night before. And then the next morning it was like in the clients and working and I couldn't connect to anything.

And then the next morning it was like in the clients and working and I couldn't connect to anything. Which is normally the pattern but yeah like just this one was like the biggest one-time change that I can recall either.

**Intermediate:**

> Um, you can find me usually on Twitter for the Ethereum people, uh, C H R Jens. Of course I have a complicated name, not many vocals in there, but you find it. Um, or of course on LinkedIn, actually for my company, I'm more active on LinkedIn, which I was never before, but that's where we get our clients as tokenize it. Um, yeah, but usually you can find me on Twitter. Follow me there on LinkedIn. Excellent. Okay. Thanks so much. Have a great day. Thank you. It was great talking to you. Bye.

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, it was important. And then Slack, I think I got introduced to Slack by Stéphane Toual when he created a community for the DAO. When he looked for a new communication tool, he went with Slack. And at that time, it was not like today, like a business tool for the company. It was really communities. Like we had 5,000 people in our Slack, which is not how it's used today.

**Intermediate:**

> should be totally doable today it's not rocket science you know um let me interject we ourselves have made sort of different attempts at this where like you just download the app from the chain itself pretty much um it worked fine and i guess it just wasn't as much a differentiator like it made things a little slower uh uh to to do it this way all the time I also think like one of the people that took the Web3, the world computer vision sort of seriously was like the internet computer people. And I don't know anyone that uses internet computer, but like every once in a while I see tweets about it and I'm like, that sounds great. Yeah, start the app from the chain. You know, it's got some cool like smart contracting language in it.

**Intermediate:**

> And so DevCon was November 2015, so that was announced earlier in the year, I think September-ish, but ended up being cancelled, you know, because the Foundation were basically, you know, this same ming-out money piece. uh but then primarily with consensus funding and support uh you know hey it's back on um so that was in that was in london um and you know significantly larger uh event obviously than the nevcon zero because it was the first you know public uh ethereum outing with microsoft as a as a headline sponsor you had nick sabo speaking as well maybe satoshi maybe not satoshi i don't think he's strongly alluded to it in the presentation it was funny so so yeah how how was that for you then christopher what was uh you know
