SPEAKER_00: Alrighty. Well, thanks everyone for coming back. We've done a couple of videos, so we've done two on the early days of Ethereum and I actually did another video on Identity following that, which you can check out on my channel. And in the process we're excited to reconnect with Bob Summerwill. So Bob will ask to introduce himself in a second, but he actually went quite in depth, you know, in reaction to the videos and helping to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum. Wrote a long blog post that you should check out and we'll link in the notes and we asked him to join us here today to kind of dig more into the story and also just generally catch up. So with that, maybe I'll hand it to Bob to do a quick intro and we can just kind of get into it.

SPEAKER_01: So, yeah. Hi. You know, thanks so much for the invite. You know, like I said to you guys, you know, I love those first two videos, you know, I love this history and it was great to both hear that and have a slightly different perspective as well. You know, our paths have overlapped in some ways and haven't in others. So you know, there are a few things that came up which I wasn't myself aware of. I mean just for everyone's background about me and who I am. So I got interested in blockchain in 2014, but it was 2015 where I really jumped in and that happened because I was working in Toronto, I had a six month contract and was working in Toronto around the same time that Ethereum was doing a mainnet launch. And I'd actually met Vitalik for the first time in 2014, but just kind of following along a little bit, not actually doing anything. But then moving to Toronto, it's just like orders of magnitude more stuff going on and meetups and Anthony Di Iorio's Bitcoin Decentral co-working space and everything. So I got really very addicted through that year and it was like right, I can't not get involved. It's like you're there at the birth of the web or whatever and you've met Tim Berners-Lee and he's about to go live on the web and it's like how can you not want to get involved. So I just started sort of volunteering and helping. My background prior to that was in the games industry. So like 15 years of C#, 15 years of C++. So I was like well, I can do something with cpp-ethereum. And I was really into mobile and wearables. So my first thing I set myself is can I get Ethereum running on my smartwatch. Could you get a smartwatch and go around like bing, there's some money, that'd be really cool. So yeah, I just started doing stuff on there that was about the time that Gav was parting company with the foundation as well. So there was kind of a dearth of people on that team. So like that period, I ended up being I think the only person in the world who was actually helping on that. Like no companies, nobody was helping. And then I ended up getting hired into the foundation in early 2016. And yeah, I've been involved on Ethereum Enterprise, Ethereum Hyperledger, then more recently Ethereum Classic for nearly a decade now.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Bob, well, and to be open to everyone, like world friends, and we're happy to have you as our first guest who's on this thing. But also you are like the Nelson Mandela of the Ethereum ecosystem. You're friends with everyone, you've been in everywhere. So it's great to have your perspective on things.

SPEAKER_01: Thank you.

SPEAKER_02: So, and as Kieren has mentioned, for anyone who hasn't seen Bob's blog post, it's notionally a blog post, almost a full novel, probably a novella size. It has pictures of a lot of the people we're talking about. You dug up so much content out of there. Were those your personal pictures? It's just stuff.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, just stuff. I had another thing here is there's a couple of articles on my own blog from earlier that I linked into there as well which was there's one called Ethereum Foundation People and one called Ethereum Foundation Timeline. So I made those in late 2017, early 2018, because there was no canonical history of any of this. Yeah, it's like how did Ethereum start. It's in people's heads. It's all secondhand stories that you hear from people that were around. But what's true, what isn't. Because I think especially on that foundation side, it was such a mess. Just like all different people weren't getting on, blowing up kind of like Parity versus the foundation and Charles. So I think some people had almost taken this position of like that we don't talk about that. Because anything I say like it's going to offend somebody else. So just la la la it doesn't matter. But yeah, so I started gathering that list of well, who were the people that were around in the pre-foundation days and in that. And so yeah, I've got this people page which I think is really cool. Just it's got so that's basically from 2013 through to early 2018, identifying anyone that I could that was involved with Ethereum pre-foundation or who worked for the foundation in those early years. And one of the things that's really great there is DEVCON 0, which happened in I think October 2014. So that was the very first DEVCON. But it was a closed event. That wasn't a public event.

And it was foundation people at that time. But there were also some other key community sort of people there as well. And they did this one thing at the start that was introductions. So there's this video that's about 15 or 20 minutes long of everybody like hi, I'm Vlad. I'm here doing proof of stake research. Just see these so young, so many people that like really early 20s. And turning up and it's like that's so right. And some of these people as well, they're not involved anymore. They're sort of like footnotes in history. But you have that record. And so yeah, that list of people, I got all of that together. And the reason that that came about was in late 2017, I got a message from Laura Shin saying hey, I hear Ming's been sacked at the Foundation. Like do you know anything about this. And I said well no I don't but it wouldn't surprise me. But basically it would be like Vitalik or maybe Hudson could tell you. But like nobody else could tell you anyway. And it sort of came out well yeah, she's not been sacked but she's agreed to leave.

And then it's like well what's next. So I contacted Vitalik and said hey is there anything I can do to help. What can I do and he said well the one thing you can do is can you try and talk to people and work out like what would good look like, what do people think a good Ethereum foundation would look like. And so that started my sort of adventure really of like right, I'm gonna go and talk to all the founders, all the other people, and try and work out like what. And then that just turned into really mind a thought experiment on my side of like okay so to my mind Ming was terrible. So how did she get hired. What was going on two and a half years back that looked like a good option. How did it work before. How did the foundation come about. And what were the group of leaders and what were all the dynamics between all of these people. So yeah, I went down quite a rabbit hole there. And that's the genesis for that information gathering. And I learned a lot. And that information as well I gave to Laura and to the other two authors that were doing their Ethereum books is kind of like right, there is no canonical but this is kind of what I found which is maybe like the best information that there was at that time.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, and also it's to your point is that I think generally people have sort of survivorship bias about like everything works smooth but innovation is messy. It's messy and it's like there are a million and one different paths that things could have went to. And we just want to kind of acknowledge all that like given where the ecosystem is today. And even though it's amazing to me that so many people know about it that later I spent, we all spent the first years trying to get anyone to listen to us talk about blockchain, and no one, everyone just glaze over. So it's just kind of nice to take that retrospective view at this point. Oh, went a little bit far. We'll just go with it.

SPEAKER_01: One of the things that I know that Vitalik said, and again it was maybe in Laura Shin's book was like the founding of Ethereum was very atypical because it was essentially like here's a white paper out to a bunch of random people who may be interested, and it's like basically like first people that turn up, you're the founders. A number of them they'd not even met each other before that. Not really a lot of knowledge. And so yeah, there were lots of interpersonal things that just didn't work at all. It's just like no like founding a company. And I'm sure you guys have this experience yourself. You want to start with people that you kind of know and trust a bit because you know that you're going through the fire together. So you better have some stickability with you and common alignment or at least knowing that you've got good communication to go through those bad times. You know that you can work it out.

And what seems to happen on Ethereum is absolutely the polar opposite of that. It's just random bunch of people who were there, didn't really know each other. Like make that commitment before you even know what you're even doing. And so that didn't work so great.

SPEAKER_02: And I think.

SPEAKER_00: Also, let me actually I wanted to ask about that. I'm also just looking at the list of the Ethereum foundation people which is remarkably long for the type of initiative it was. You know we talk about this because we're a management team and we're trying to get people to focus on particular goals and things our company wants to do and such. Do you think there is any benefit to this level of you could call it disorganization or just I kind of think if there were a benefit and it wasn't merely just an inefficient and painful process that Ethereum succeeded in spite of, it's kind of it embodied the ethos and it let people like Vitalik put the idea out there, and then people fought for its destiny, like Ethereum existed, and then they wanted to be part of taking it too. And he saw just the clients and all that too. Sorry Jim, go ahead.

SPEAKER_03: I was gonna say it kind of worked like a blockchain works in fact.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: Lots of random people coming together with some underlying principle to organize things and then they fight it out.

SPEAKER_02: But what's that law that organization technology reflects the organization. So yeah something like that. Yes. Sorry.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah I mean in general yes having that frothing emergent stuff is good. I think where it was really screwed though was to do with money and the ICO funding. That it's basically like okay here we're doing the thing and here the money is all actually in this organizational group and the people in that group are being funded are in this privileged position. It's something which Brian Behlendorf said to me in later years was it's sort of like the original sin of Ethereum is if you want to have that kind of collaboration. So whatever stuff like the EEA and Hyperledger or even just the rather looser protocol development around Ethereum, you don't want to pay one team and not the others.

Because that just screws that battlefield. So you have this situation for example where you've got the C client and you've got Gav. You did have the Python client as well so you had that good triangulation but it was essentially like the funded ones were C and Go. And then they had the money crisis of like oh my God is this thing even going to happen. We've got cut scope, C is gone, Gav ends up going out of the way. And then you had Parity having one of the major clients but without funding. So it's like Geth oh Geth that's the favored child. It's not like the official client but it is the official client. So all that sort of like separation of implementation versus specification and in that free market around that was really skewed because the money was with Gav and Geth were in the foundation and they've got Vitalik's kind of blessing and everything. So I think that's where things were great because you did have the diversity but it wasn't fair diversity. And I think if you look at what's happening now on the consensus clients for I was going to say Ethereum 2, it's not called Ethereum 2 anymore. But the separation that you have with those execution clients and consensus clients, none of those consensus clients are made by the foundation. The foundation doesn't have client teams. They do funding like they got the grants and I think all of those teams are going to be grant recipients. So that's kind of centralization in a way but it is an even playing field in terms of the development. Because you've got an evenness of funding. And that wasn't the case originally for Ethereum. And I think that that made a lot of bitterness as well because it's like well why have you guys got the money. We're making another one as well. Or other parts of the ecosystem. Like there wasn't a grants program for a number of years. Yeah between about 2015 and 2018 there wasn't even a grants program. You got the foundation sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars and teams couldn't even get funded for doing anything. So yeah I think the diversity is good but the money was bad.

SPEAKER_00: Interesting. Yeah I think right okay that's a good strong point. So if you compare to like Bitcoin which I know less about the history of the development of Bitcoin but it was kind of similar. There was less of a there was no pre-mine and no token presale. And so the people who were in it were in it for general interest and it was really sincerely an even playing field. And I would argue you know and in some ways Ethereum has made bigger strides than Bitcoin especially since let's say 2015. Some of the value prop of Bitcoin is that it never changes and that's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way. But it's I think been stifled a little bit for that reason. I think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes in a fully decentralized manner.

SPEAKER_01: Another major difference there talking about clients is it was a very deliberate decision right on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients and that there were multiple clients from day one. I see if I can find my Twitter thread. I was finding these the other day. I was finding the first commits for PI Ethereum PI F app or PI Ethereum as it was CPP Ethereum and Go Ethereum. And they were all I think they were all November or December I think they were all 2013 not even 2014 for those three. And then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April I think. But you know.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah Jim Kieren you guys started ethereum H in 2014.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah we were much later.

SPEAKER_02: We were.

SPEAKER_03: When did we get quarter 2014.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah that's right.

SPEAKER_02: That's about right.

SPEAKER_00: And I had worked on Ethereum just in the summer. So starting kind of maybe June 2014 I got to know the project pretty well and then I gone back to Berkeley. I was in New York for the summer and met Jim September October something like that. And we started work more or less right away. More Jim than me. But so yeah so there was a big time delay on our side and yeah I think okay yeah Bob it's an interesting point right I think probably they could have there was some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds not doing any hedging. And then later I guess I agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling and that would have alienated fewer people and it could have even just been bigger than it is today. Obviously we're talking about a smashing success here but it's sort of the idea and the community was so powerful that it this definitely succeeded in in spite of aspect I think there was value still in this like throw it out there get people to fight over it but probably overcorrected. And lots of these people also just went and started their own thing.

SPEAKER_01: I mean the other thing is right at the start there it's like well the people that doing it that was the whole world. That was everything. Was several months. I mean all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed. That was actually unfunded.

Because I'm looking at the dates. So the white paper came out in November 2013. PI Ethereum was started on November 19 2013. Gav actually was in contact with Vitalik on that same day. CPP Ethereum started four days later 23rd of December. Obviously some over Christmas hacking on these things going on and then Go Ethereum was December 26th. So just three further days. The foundation got formed I think in May April or May 2014 but the crowd sale didn't conclude until September 2014. So you'd actually got about nine months worth of development on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded. So I think I think that unfairness kind of came in a little bit later. I think for that phase it was like nobody got funded. Oh sorry nobody got funded though there was the retrospective payback. When the crowd sale had gone through you had money for early contributors which I think was nearly 10% for like 100 120 people. Like some people made out like absolute bandits for those early months. But then yeah following that there was hiring of actual staff onto those teams. And that I think is when it became kind of uneven because you already had Ethereum J for a number of months there and that never got funded and then you and then you guys starting whenever you were starting. So yeah it kind of became uneven I think at that point. And probably the worst of it of all was for Parity when that team spun out and you basically did have a major rapidly load bearing client and it was just unfunded. Especially in with Gav who was had been the CTO and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client and all of the value he delivered and then it's like right sorry you're out and you're not getting any money.

SPEAKER_02: Do you.

SPEAKER_00: So my memory around the C client was that there were funds to do a security audit for two clients but one at a time and it was tight. And so they did Go Ethereum first and I think they did actually do the security audit on CPP Ethereum but I'm not quite sure they did.

SPEAKER_01: You know maybe there'd been an intention to do that but then the money ran out before it happened. I mean my understanding in terms of uptake as well is CPP Ethereum was like working first but then Go Ethereum just like caught up and overtook it like really fast. So when they were making those decisions on cutting funding which would have been mid-2015 it's like hey Gav you're the CTO but it's your code base that's got a copy. And then that's what happened.

SPEAKER_02: I do remember waiting like many times trying to build things coming back looking at it saying like this can't be like my machine's got to be broken because like it can't be this long. Can't be like eight hours. Like nothing I could imagine would take more than eight hours to do but you're right it just like.

SPEAKER_01: You know talking about that creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated and everything. One of my first observations on joining the foundation is these people seem allergic to professionalism because that seems in an organized way. Well you're one of the baddies you're the status quo. You're trying to subvert it and take it over. Things as simple as like have we got like technical leads that actually lead. Have we got any project management. Have we got any IT. Have we got anything. And it's like no it's just like a jumble of people doing stuff. And it's like well how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment. But that was kind of the vibe as well. That was seen as a good thing because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing. We don't want this to be a Silicon Valley thing.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: You know I think I just have a comment. It's interesting and maybe I commented on this in one of the other videos one of these rare big software projects that did not very much come from the United States. It's Canada it's different parts of Europe. And one of those confusing things about to your point about who got paid for the clients on the foundation. I think I remember there being a deal struck with Zug the canton basically around it. There's tax stuff and all that sort of thing. But they also sort of intended to hire and operate locally. People would either move there or they'd hire ETH Zurich grads or whatever. And I don't know the details specifically but I think that didn't quite end up happening that way and sort of as a surprise. And I saw some of this firsthand at the meeting in which Amir and Charles were sent on their way. The client team set up in their own countries. And that was like a bit of a script flip. Like Gavin wanted to be in Berlin because the devs were good and expensive and they'd be like living there inexpensive. Excuse me. And yeah I think it's just you would running my own business you would never make such a decision in such a flip manner where like overnight we're like oh we're doing a different country. But they that was kind of a regular occurrence to some extent. Major things changing as part of how the foundation plus sort of operated that I saw. And again it didn't seem to hurt quite as much as you might expect. But yeah but I think you had to have you were lucky in how people works how excited people were about the project that it survived all of this. And again from our side we're sitting in the Bay Area at that time and we're like why why do they keep doing all of these things like they're trying to build a thousand things and it's hard to build one thing.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah I mean so there were separate legal entities for those as well. So you have FDEV AG in Berlin. And then there was an Amsterdam thing for the Geth team. You had the London stuff as well which was mainly communications sort of stuff with Stefan and George Hallam Ian Meikle and one other person who I forget. But you talk about these people working for the Ethereum foundation like but it was always woollier than that. So yeah you did have the stick home in Zug but most people even if they're working full time they weren't actually working for that. So when I had my contract it was with the for profit FDEV in Berlin. That was who I was actually working for. And then they were funded by the foundation and an FDEV in general. That was another big split that there was right was you got the foundation but then you had FD that was like the kind of umbrella group for that that Gav was leading essentially. So I think the Amsterdam thing like rolled into Berlin. I think that was all sort of FDEV side. And that in itself was a huge item of conflict. I know again in Laura's book I think Joe was talking about that was that Gav kind of like wanted a big chunk of money. It's like right the funds are there from the crowd sale now so give them all to us. And it's like I don't know that we want to give you all the funds as you go. But that was typical of that period is just a mess of complexity and interpersonal things and organizational complexity. And with that with that Swiss people thing. So my understanding on that was that was like a main motivation for like getting renting that spaceship building. Was the intention was that there were going to be a load of people there. Maybe it was I think testing was one of the ones I heard was maybe a goal there is like right we're going to get a load of Swiss people to test things. And there's also like Mihai with his Holon ideas Holon of these co-working spacey things around the world.

SPEAKER_02: And when and also to make it a little bit more woolier like same time like very shortly Consensus emerged out of that too and they were doing a bunch of work. We were technically working under Consensus for the first low parts of it too. And all of that was like in the mix everywhere. So I want to jump ahead a bit because we have you as an ETC expert and in our last one we had a lot of questions around what we've remembered from Slock.it and the DAO hack. So maybe you could walk us through that and how ETC emerged out of that. That part was a little bit vague to us because we didn't follow much on how those pieces all came together.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So I mean one of the groups or companies that came out of this kind of like shrinking of the foundation was that on that C team that got most of the cuts a good chunk of those people went to just went straight to Parity and just like carried on with that new client. But Christoph Jentzsch who had been working leading that testing effort that we're just talking about those same tests he and Stefan Tual who had been community communications lead that's sort of community stuff and Lefteris Karapetsas who'd also been on C team those three went off and formed a company called Slock.it. So Slock.it being smart locks just the idea that you if you're doing an Airbnb or something that you can have a smart lock and that you could go and do your contract with someone for the rental and then that could be enabling something on the lot that's checking an Oracle or a non-chain thing and so on. And so that was their product area at DEVCON1 they did like an on stage demo that was it was like a pot of. It was like a petal. Like a pot.

A transaction that turned it on to make a cup of tea. Yeah like that was the onstage demo. But what seemed to happen there was like they didn't want to do an ICO. They wanted it to be fairer I guess because around that era the more later you saw lots of cash grab ICOs and it's like right here's all the money up front. We're not going deliver. What are you gonna do.

So they didn't want to do that because they were very genuine people who come out of the foundation and were kind of ideologically driven. So Vitalik had written stuff about DAOs. I think they were mentioned in the white paper even. And it's like well maybe we can make a DAO. And I think that was just Slock.it DAO really originally. And it was like right we're going to have a DAO. The money is going to go into there but then it's only going to get released to us as we deliver milestones. So it's kind of like this separation of like right the DAO is where the money is and that's controlled by the token holders. Slock.it as a company is a service provider into that. But we're a sackable service provider and we're only going to get paid as we go through the milestones. So it's like oh that's really interesting. And to my understanding that's what was presented at DEVCON1. I remember was like hey we're Slock.it this is what we're doing and we're going to do a DAO with it. And it's like oh cool. But then they kept working on that DAO stuff after DEVCON 1 and it just seemed to like warp into well we've made like a DAO framework. It's a DAO library because we want other people to be able to do this as well. But then that sort of turned into well actually how about it isn't just us. How about it could be anything. Anyone could have a service provider. You could propose anything into it. And then it became the DAO.

And it wasn't capped. There was no cap on the contributions into it. There was really nothing else that you could do on Ethereum at that point. It was kind of like the first application really. Well I mean you did have a few. You had Digix this gold thing. You did have Dai I think was sort of coming to life just about at that point. But the DAO was kind of like the first big thing. And it just sort of snowballed and snowballed because it was also touted as zero risk because you could exit with your funds. If you didn't like the result of what was happening you could just exit and have your ETH back. So it's kind of like this is risk free. It's like a sovereign bond or whatever.

There's no downside here. This is risk free though. Tons of people are like well what else am I going to do. I'm just sitting here on my Ether I can't do anything. Well pile on in. And the Ethereum crowd sale raised what is 16 million I think in Bitcoin which was I think it was my number five crowd sale of all time. Comparing to Kickstarter projects. So maybe they'll do 2 or 3 million maybe 5. And it just went until it was absolutely gigantic. And I remember at the time thinking this is I don't like this like the DAO. It's not this is not a good idea.

And the main reason I was thinking of that was is this a security. Is this seen as money transfer stuff. Because you've got Slock.it the company. And then they had this thing called DAO Link that was sort of a service company for paying people in real life it was that was some at Swiss thing I think or what's Bitcoin Swiss. And then you have the DAO itself you had the curators as well. So anyone could propose a smart contract that encoded their proposal. They would make a written description of the thing and here's a smart contract doing it. And the curator's role was like to verify what they've sort of said in text is kind of what they've done. It was meant to be like this kind of administrative role. But what happened is all of those guys that was their name their names and faces up on the website. So like DAO Hub website is just like a who's who of the Ethereum foundation basically. And it didn't say Christian Reitwiessner creator of Solidity it said Christian Reitwiessner Ethereum Foundation Vitalik Ethereum foundation. So lots of people were like this is an Ethereum foundation project. Because you're all got your names on everything. So I thought there was firstly there was huge like legal liability on those guys because where Slock.it had got these layers of legal protection these guys haven't. They're just doing it as individuals. And I remember Fabian talking to me and talking to the group in the foundation is like I've been talking to some of my friends and they're like they don't think this is a great idea. And I'm thinking of talking to a lawyer. And Gav backed out. A couple of weeks before the disaster Gav just backed out. He's like this is not what I signed up for. I thought it was just a small role and now it's like presented as a lot more. So he backed out. A lot of the others didn't because it was like well if we back out it's going to like ruin it. And it's like a great experiment. But I thought there was huge liability to them. I thought there were legal risks. And I also just thought it was a stupid idea. Why would you have thousands of random people putting their money in a bucket and then let's like vote on what to do with it.

Who are these people. What do they even know about a business proposal or anything. It's just like this is a stupid idea. But I didn't have my eye on the fact that all of the tech stack was incredibly immature at that point.

There's no best practices there's no libraries. It's just here's some code. And they just went all in. It was like code is law.

The smart contract is the contract. Yolo you can't stop us.

SPEAKER_02: But okay. And then the hack happens. And I remember the details of the hack being they found a flaw in the smart contract code and they could basically withdraw those funds into another account. And I remember there was some kind of race between the people at the DAO slash Slock.it who were like using the same exploit to like drain the account. Like using the same hack basically. Is that right.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So there was this reentrancy bug where it's really sort of like to do with atomic operations or order of operations. So your reentrancy was that you could be calling because people were supplying like their proposals and it's like hey here's a smart contract that's implementing mine. You were like calling into their code but you can't know what theirs is going to do. So there was this reentrancy issue where within that other person supplied code you could like kind of call back in. And it was sort of like so it was to do with child DAOs. So this whole zero risk thing was like if you didn't like proposals that were happening you could make a child DAO of saying well hey I'm out. I'm taking my ether and my voting off into this other one. I'm not following you. I'm going there. And other people could join you as well. So I guess the idea was like right here we've got this totally over general DAO but we're going to make a like a DeFi DAO or an NFT DAO or whatever. And it's like I guess a little bit like some of the thoughts for consensus and hub and spoke is like you're going to get this universe of stuff just flourishing out and childs and so on. But yeah the problem on that child DAO thing is that there was this reentrancy bug where rather than just being able to pull your ETH or your share you can actually go in and pull more and more. So you have this using this had a child DAO and pulling a giant amount of the funds into that child DAO and then within 30 days they'd be able to exit with the funds. But the blessings of that setup is they're not immediately exiting with the funds. They haven't gone already and sold it on an exchange and they're done before you notice. You have got this period. And then the other thing is that you could join them. You can go into the child DAO as well. So after the hack there was this appeal out. Hey did anyone participate in this specific child. There was anyone in there. It's like yeah somebody else is in there. And then what you could do is you could child DAO again. It's like you can do another one. It's like right well I'm going to grab it off you and you're going to grab it off me. So you could have had this DAO wars thing of like you can never stop it but you could delay it indefinitely. So that was one of them. But then the other white hat thing is like okay well we know about the bug so we can do it too. You can have white hat people like well we're going to steal all of the money out of the top DAO as well. But we're doing it for good. We're doing it here to keep it to give it back.

So yeah you had all of those games going on within that existing setup but then as a reaction to that you had all of this discussion about well are we going to react are we not going to react first. The first proposal was a soft fork but it was just gonna like blacklist out stuff to do with the hacker.

SPEAKER_02: And they did do that soft fork. Right I remember they did that soft.

SPEAKER_01: Fork first what was done for it. And I think it might even have gone on testnets and things but it never went live.

SPEAKER_02: Okay.

SPEAKER_01: Because it was spotted that it was a denial of service attack because that blacklisting was like not accounted for in the crypto economics. So it was like yeah you had a denial of service attack thing on that soft fork. So it got done and then it got undone and then the hard fork was like okay well we can go in and we can do an irregular state transaction where at a certain block you're just going to have a hardcoded thing which sticks different bytecode into the address of the DAO which is like okay yeah that thing it didn't happen. What's actually at that
