> Alrighty. Well, thanks everyone for coming back. We've done a couple of videos, so we've done two on the early days of Ethereum and I actually did another video on Identity following that, which you can check out on my channel. And in the process we're excited to reconnect with Bob Summerwell. So Bob will ask to introduce himself in a second, but he actually went quite in depth, you know, in, in reaction to the videos and helping to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum. Wrote a long blog post that you should check out and we'll link in the notes and we asked him to join us here today to kind of dig more into the story and also just generally catch up. So with that, maybe I'll hand it to Bob to do a quick intro and we can just kind of get into it.

> I mean the other thing is right at the start there, it's like, well, the people that doing it, that was the whole world, right. You know, that was everything. Right. Was several months. I mean, all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed. That was actually unfunded.

> I remember was like, hey, we're Slock it. This is what we're doing, and we're going to do a DAO with it. And it's like, oh, cool. But then they kept working on that, that DAO stuff after Devcon 1, and it just seemed to like, warp into, well, we've made like a DOW framework. It's a DOW library, you know, because we want other people to be able to do this as well. But then that sort of turned into, well, actually, how about it isn't just us. How about it could be anything. Like, anyone could have a service provider. You could propose any. Anything into it. And then it became the dao.

**Intermediate:**

> And I mean, another major difference there talking about clients is it was a very deliberate decision, right, on Ethereum to separate the specification from the clients. And there were multiple clients from day one. I see if I can find my Twitter thread. I was finding these the other day. I was finding the first commits for PyEthereum, PyEthApp, or PyEthereum as it was, CPP Ethereum and GoEthereum. And they were all, um, I think they were all November or December. I think they were all 2013, not even 2014 for those three. Yeah. Um, and then Ethereum J looked like it started in about April, I think. But yeah, Jim, Karen, you guys started Ethereum H in 2014. Yeah, we were much later. We were, um, when did we get deployed? Quarter 2014. Yeah. That sounds about right.

**Intermediate:**

> one of my first observations on joining the the foundation is these people seem allergic to professionalism because that's seen as you know in an organized way well you're one of the baddies you know you're the status quo you're trying to subvert it and take it over you know things as simple as like like you know have we got like technical leads that actually lead know have we got any project management have we got any it have we got anything and it's like no it's just like a jumble of people doing stuff um and it's like how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment um but that was kind of the vibe as well that was seen as a good thing um you know because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing right you know we don't

**Intermediate:**

> um and then you know how are those words continuing so over that month or so right where it's like you know the money's been stolen into the sub down are we going to do anything you know you have the most um you know vigorous debate on all platforms right you know it was the the topic you know what's going to happen how's it going to go and everything right so you know I don't think there's anyone that was like unaware of this stuff happening you know it's very very everyone with their eyes open Um, but yeah, you know, you just, you just have this group of people kind of gathering together and it's like, no, you know, we're not gonna go with it. This is not gonna happen. Or, or at least like, you know, we're not following that hard. Maybe people do, but you know, a bunch of people deciding not to, um, the other thing I thought was really interesting at the time and was to my mind, the, the best thing of all about that chain split is to that point, I don't think there's ever been a minority chain that survived, right? The standard thinking is like, you're going to have a winning side and a losing side. And, you know, it's going to happen and we'll see where's the thing, you know, where are the people going, which is the winner and then the losers, you know, well, you know, people will stop mining, it will just die, right? Because it's the loser chain. So there's no economic value there and, you know, forget it. But what actually happened on the ATC side is, you know, you had miners that were like, well, you know, just going to keep on mining. I'm not updating, you know. You know, some of it going, you know, the evil Ethereum Foundation and, you know, Vitalik's a dictator. You know, I mean, I don't think any of that's true. But you have got people that were like, no, I'm going to keep going. And then, oh, look, block production's still going and, you know, it's still happening there. uh and then poloniex listed it and then it's got a market value and then you've got speculative activity around that you've got ether holders like dumping their etc you know it's hey it's free money um but also you've got other people on the other side going well you know i see real value here and like this etc is going cheap so you know noticeably notably barry silbert who first non-bit in ethereum to that point presumably like based on pre-mine and various other things but was like well oh actually like you know an immutability focused dtc uh you know would be would be really interesting so yeah you just got this sort of grassroots thing forming you've got volunteers jumping up saying hey you know I'm a developer I'll keep maintaining the the classic geth clients and so on and um you know and it it found its own uh legs there you know you had like the the ethereum subreddit was like a primary communication platform at that point and then you had like an appearing classic one um you know being created and some people in you know, one side, some on the other, but you know, it, it got quite bitter in the end, right? You know, you've got a lot of people that were like, you know, foundation, you guys, you just ruined, you know, you've just ruined the project. Um, and you had people, um, on the other side, seeing is seeing ETC is really illegitimate, you know, as, as saying, well, look, you, you know, it's just a money grab. You just want your free money. Um, you know, why are these Bitcoiners kind of coming over? Like they weren't interested in Ethereum before and now they are like, that's not, you know, uh, you know, that's, that's not good. And, and you did obviously have a bunch of speculators in there as well. So that's all a bit nasty too. Um, but I think the thing that like severed those communities, um, finally was this like 100% F meme which came about because somebody tweeted, hey Vitalik, I hear that you're working on Ethereum Classic. Is there any truth to this? And he said, no, I'm only working on Ethereum. And the person then said, well, what if ETC had more market cap than Ethereum? And he said, no, I still wouldn't work on it. 100 F like he wasn't saying it in a purity pledge we was just in the way he does being just making a factual statement but then I remember you know Joe replied you know I'm 100 F and then it's like everyone's doing it right it's this purity pledge you know everyone is expected to you know pledge allegiance to air So it became a, you know, oh, shit, is this an either or? Like, you can't be in both. Like, if you're interested in ETC, then, you know, you're a dirty person. So I think that really wedged it, you know, wedged it permanently apart at that point. And also, you know, a number of the people that were volunteering on ETC, you know, they were really angry. They were like, you know, well, I, you know, been involved for, two two and a bit years in this project you know really pumped about everything that you can do with ethereum and that you guys have you know wrecked it so there was a lot of you know bitterness from that ec side back um but then you know things kind of split apart and and over time etc you know found its own path so with the real differentiation being Well, firstly, the DAO hack didn't happen. That was the only initial difference. Very rapidly, though, there was this conclusion that fixed economic policy was needed. You know, the ETC was really like Bitcoin with Ethereum technology, but, you know, Bitcoin, you know, culture and ethos. So it's like, right, you know, there's no fixed monetary policy for Ethereum. I mean, you see this over many years is like, you know, change of change of block rewards ice age delays uh fee burning you know many many changes so um that was the first kind of like major change on the etc side was introduction of that fixed monetary policy because there was consensus that that was an import you know that was like bad inheritance that we that we want to fix and the other thing that that enabled was the uh the grayscale etc fund So at that point, it's like, right, okay, this is really a Bitcoin feeling thing. And there's a feeling that there's a value here. So then from that, Grayscale then created the ETC cooperative that I work from. So a share of the fees went into that kind of not quite a foundation, but a bit like a foundation, a nonprofit to support the ecosystem. And then the other thing more recently is just proof of work. You know, there was sort of fairly rapidly a consensus that ETC wanted to stick with proof of work indefinitely, but that proof of state was seen as a, you know, as a centralising, oligarchic, kind of thing that didn't really fit with that ethos. But more generally, ETC is tracking protocol changes in Ethereum, you know, very compatible. So there have been forks, but not the hard fork along the way, because... Well, so yeah, I mean, hard forks, but not chain splits. Got it. Okay. In the all protocol updates on Ethereum as well, you know, they're all hard forks. And the old side doesn't actually go away. You could run a Frontier node if you wanted. You can mine on Frontier, mine the Olympic testnet, mine any of these ones. It's just you have had the wither and die because there hasn't been contention. But on ETC, you have sufficient contention that you had a chain split. But yeah, I guess that's sort of a Bitcoin forks are bad, but it's like, consensuous hard forks are bad. Hard forks are an upgrade mechanism for the protocol. Yeah. I mean, I remember I had to implement that fork a few years ago and it was pretty blatant. It was just like, take money from here and place it here.

Where can people find you? Do you want them to find you, et cetera? Yeah, I can drop you some links afterwards. But yeah, my own website is bobsonworld.com. ethereumclassic.org is the main sort of landing page for ECC. Awesome. Fantastic. Well, thank you very much. Really appreciate your time. And I'm sure we will follow up. We'll put our heads together and do another one. Yes, we'll have to have a round two. There's plenty more stories that we haven't even touched on yet. Okay. Cheers, guys. Cheers.

> All righty. Well, thanks, everyone, for coming back. We've done a couple of videos. So we've done two on the early days of Etheria, and I actually did another video on identity following that, which you can check out on my channel. In the process, we're excited to reconnect with Bob Summerwell. So Bob will ask to introduce himself in a second, but he actually went quite in depth in reaction to the videos and helping to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum. Wrote a long blog post that you should check out and we'll link in the notes. We asked him to join us here today to kind of dig more into the story and also just generally catch up. So with that, maybe I'll hand it to Bob to do a quick intro and we can just kind of get into it.

> I mean, I was, I was sort of building, uh, the various clients quite a bit, cuz I was trying to integrate with them at the time. And my memory was that the C plus plus client had all the newest stuff in it first. So if I wanted to see something first, I would go there, but the go client was more stable. Like because I think because they were putting so much stuff into the C++ client, it was often an unstable situation. And so I would typically kind of go to C++ first to see the new stuff. But if it wasn't building that day, I would run over to go and try it out.
