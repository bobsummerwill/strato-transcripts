> you know, survive cycles in crypto. You know, just someone will pay that big conference fee. Yeah, and it seems those fees are getting bigger and bigger too, right? It's just very, very expensive. Garbage? Garbage? I got it. Garbage? So, yeah. And we don't want to keep you too long. Obviously, you got important things to do around the house. Bob, what do you think about the global and the boring part of it?

**Intermediate:**

> pouring more money into it from the seams of it. At a time, I think much of the space was extremely eager for institutional approval, even with some nominal hostility to it. And I now feel the emotion that I'm like, I almost don't want it. I'm like, get out of here. I want it to go back. I guess I'm happy maybe about the asset values, although it's not my primary motivation at all. But I hope that they don't, because the thing you see with like, you know, the Web2 world, while the internet remains at least kind of open, the people use like six apps. And so it's just pretty easy to affect the whole planet of users of the internet just through these six apps. And I kind of... It could easily happen that way in crypto, where crypto itself remains totally open. But like, as a for instance, so the company, we have a Coinbase account, which we use a little bit, and they are way more difficult and onerous and making information requests all the time than any bank I've dealt with. It's bizarre. They try to introduce a whitelist for the accounts you could send out to. This was like a month ago. Apparently you could turn this feature off and it's for your protection in case someone's gotten in there. But it's like you're worse than the thing you said that you were setting out to destroy from a is-it-our-money perspective. And that feels... You know, I'm happy that the Genius Act passed, I think, but it also has that feel, too. Coinbase itself is now in, like, a fight with the banks. Like, wait, wait, wait, we didn't mean you could do this. We want an all-yield band. So...

#### [32:03] SPEAKER_01 (block 22/28)

**Intermediate:**

> I wonder if that's changed. It used to be like the joke that I've both experienced in my face to face life and like on crypto Twitter. It's like when you're like dentist or realtor friend asks you about what you think about Cardano or Ripple, then it's time to sell. There was plenty of Charles, but no Ripple. Yeah, I wonder. I think BNB flipped XRP recently. They did. I just saw that. Yeah, up to number three. Amazing. How are you guys feeling about having been in the space for so long that long-term projects like MetaMask are now launching a token? Oh, yeah, yeah. This is another part of the crazy. This is a good reminder. I think basically just a lot was held back by uncertainty. And so the high-quality stuff A strange thing about the Gensler era was that it felt like at least the eye of Sauron was on the good projects and the bad projects, in a sense, were sort of left to run and the good ones. So like any industry, if you looked at all of the businesses, Most of them are bad. Most of them go out of business. And if you imagine if you like made all the businesses publicly traded, most of the stocks would go to zero. So you would kind of expect in crypto that like most tokens are bad. It's sort of like what you would see if you just made essentially no barriers to entry to like publicly listing stock, not that tokens are stock, but anyway. So, however, if you kind of market cap weighted, you would probably find that the things near the top are pretty high quality. And then sometimes things will come out of the bottom and go into the top. But by and large, you should sort of forget about that long tail of things. And it did feel like, to a significant degree, the eye was on the big things. And it tried to destroy them before there was a token or freeze them or what have you. it left the bad stuff to run amok, contributing to the impression that the space was just all scams. And it might be all scams by number of projects. The average project might be a scam or just not worth any value. But the average business is not a good business. But the big ones are good most of the time, not all of them. And they're kind of just being allowed out.

#### [40:42] SPEAKER_02 (block 28/28)

**Intermediate:**

> Um, and that really changes things. Yeah. And, um, one question, uh, like, are we going to DevConnect? I know me and Bob have already bought our tickets. Karen, you're the hoedown. Can I get a commitment? I'm still a problem. Let me, um, I want, I've never been to Argentina. I really do want to go. Um, but. I really want to see what's going on. Yeah, I haven't been to South America, and I really want to see what's happening in the crypto world over there. Because you hear a lot about it. Obviously, there are big exchanges and big projects there. So I'm just really curious to find out. Vitalik said he's more likely to get recognized in Buenos Aires than in the US, say. Yeah. Well, and so if you like this content, please join us every week. We have this at the same time. Follow us on Twitter at straddlemercada with an A and join our Telegram community. Bob, if they want to hear more from you, where can they find you? Yeah, so I'm just Bob Simerill, same as my name, on Twitter. And Kieran, where can people find you? um k james lubin um so shortened but but my name also um on on twitter slash x and you can find me at vic for wong on twitter um bob and karen have both shamed me publicly because i have so few followers even though i was an early adopter so please please uh connect to me love to hear from you what what's the fall about what what's the vic for what's what's that so Four is a number that no Chinese person likes because it sounds suspiciously like death. So back in the world of eight-character usernames, I could always get Vic4Wong because having an Asian name with the number four in it pretty much guaranteed that I could get it. Always doing things the Wong way. Yeah. Exactly. I've never heard that joke before. Okay. Thank you, everyone. See you again next week. Take care. Cheers, guys.

**Intermediate:**

> Yes. So, you know, we've been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey. So you'll get, hopefully, no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we're going to talk about today. And today we are going to talk about the highlights from Token 2049. And was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world? Joining me is Bob Summerwell. Bob, you want to do a quick intro?

**Intermediate:**

> Practically illegal. Yes, exactly. I think booth babes are gone. But Token was very much like a booth babe conference. And in fact, they were sort of like, almost like seemingly more of them than last year. And then this led to like, does this mean we're near the top? Like, You know, like, is the price speculation at a maximum at this moment? And I got... You know, it wasn't euphoria. But people were feeling pretty good. And I like a conference when people are feeling a little shitty. Right. Because then, you know, there's room for things to run. I think... yeah like for better for worse interest in the industry as a whole just trends upwards with prices so like it's good for us for for prices to go up um but um Yeah, I mean, I could see, I think the digital asset treasuries too are also evidence that it's kind of late cycle. But even still, stuff is just happening really quickly. I think products kind of mostly work in crypto now. There's a strange moment where like DeFi just worked. And this is part of the reason why we really got into it. It definitely like only kind of worked through 2021, 2022, maybe even 2023. And then it just kind of functions and it's big. Like every week or so I see of the ave people tweet like how big it would be compared to the us banks and it's like 47 43 36 uh you know it's running um and so there's a feeling of inevitability that kicked in for me like a couple months ago that you know has has i've never quite felt what about you bob what did you find you know on the craziness level what do you think is
