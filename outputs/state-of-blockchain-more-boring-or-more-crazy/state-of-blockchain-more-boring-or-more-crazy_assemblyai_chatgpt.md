**[00:03] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, I think we are live.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_01:** Live, yes.

**[00:12] SPEAKER_00:** Let’s just give a minute for people to join.

**[00:16] SPEAKER_01:** Alrighty.

**[00:24] SPEAKER_02:** So I looked at the background noise reduction. It says “not supported in this browser.” I’m using Firefox. Perhaps it has to be Chrome.

**[00:33] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[00:36] SPEAKER_01:** You must pick from the two available choices.

**[00:40] SPEAKER_00:** Safari. Yeah, Safari has a huge amount, just because of the iPhone.

**[00:49] SPEAKER_01:** Is it called Edge still?

**[00:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_02:** Nobody uses Edge. Nobody uses it.

**[00:56] SPEAKER_01:** I bet you it’s a lot. Hold on.

**[00:59] SPEAKER_02:** I seem to remember seeing—and I can’t remember if it was on Edge or Bing, or probably both—but the most searched thing was how to install Chrome.

**[01:10] SPEAKER_01:** That’s funny. True, though. Wow. Chrome just continues to rise in market share. It’s gone from 66% roughly about a year ago to 72% now worldwide. Safari is trending down. Yeah, they’re just pretty tiny. Wow. Opera is still around. That’s amazing.

**[01:40] SPEAKER_02:** They all use Chromium, though.

**[01:42] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, fair enough.

**[01:45] SPEAKER_00:** Oddly, my son uses Opera. Okay, we are live now on Twitter.

**[01:51] SPEAKER_01:** Live. Live.

**[01:53] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, so should we wait another minute, or should we just start?

**[02:03] SPEAKER_01:** That’s a good question. We can ease into the substance of the content. Do we have any minute-long non-sequiturs, cold opens?

**[02:16] SPEAKER_00:** Well, maybe we should do our intros, because we—

**[02:19] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, we could do the intros.

**[02:22] SPEAKER_00:** Hi everyone. Welcome to our weekly show. If you don’t know, we are all part of the Strato Mercado project that is a Layer 1 EVM-compatible blockchain focused on bringing DeFi to the masses. Now, we—the three of us here—are all longtime builders and all Ethereum OGs. I’m Victor Wong. Vic.

**[02:49] SPEAKER_01:** I don’t know if you can describe yourself as an OG. I think someone else has to describe you as that.

**[02:54] SPEAKER_00:** Someone else has to bestow that.

**[02:55] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly.

**[02:56] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, you two. No, you.

**[02:59] SPEAKER_02:** Can we say it to each other?

**[03:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[03:01] SPEAKER_01:** Can we say you are an OG?

**[03:04] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, I said that as a—

**[03:06] SPEAKER_01:** Collection in a circle.

**[03:07] SPEAKER_00:** Right, exactly.

**[03:08] SPEAKER_01:** You can tell Bob. Bob’s an OG. Bob can tell me. I can tell you.

**[03:12] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. So we’ve been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey. So you’ll get, hopefully, no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we’re going to talk about today. Today we are going to talk about the highlights from Token2049, and was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world? Joining me is Bob Summerwill. Bob, you want to do a quick intro?

**[03:46] SPEAKER_02:** Hi there, I’m Bob Summerwill. We are all—we’re not old, we’re all very experienced. But yes, I’m Head of Ecosystem.

**[03:58] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And Kieren, of course.

**[04:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I am also experienced. Not as long as you can be in the space, but it’s starting to feel like it, right? Like we’ve really been around for some time. But yes, I’m—

**[04:14] SPEAKER_00:** I will bestow the OG title on you, Kieren. So we could go—I mean, anyone that’s been around since before the launch of Ethereum and was part of it, I think, you know, we can claim that title.

**[04:31] SPEAKER_01:** How the time goes.

**[04:34] SPEAKER_00:** So I will say that I was not in Singapore. I kind of played hooky with Kieren’s approval. International travel is brutal, but Bob and Kieren were there. And I want to get your impressions. What do you think the big themes this year were at Token2049?

**[04:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, a bunch of big topics. One thing that was notable is that it felt like meme coins had almost completely vanished, and there was a lot of that the previous year.

**[05:13] SPEAKER_00:** And can I pour one out for the meme coins?

**[05:15] SPEAKER_01:** Basically, in meme coins’ defense, I’m actually kind of pro meme coin. The problem is just the time horizon that people want to make money in—seconds. I think if a meme around a concept can kind of grow organically for some period of time, it’s great.

**[05:34] SPEAKER_02:** But—

**[05:34] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, it’s just the impatience and nihilism seems to increase with each cycle. But maybe not this one. The conference felt kind of less scammy in general. And a lot of digital asset treasury talk—I think we can go into that as we go. A lot of stablecoin talk. A lot of merger-with-TradFi sort of feel. I also think something has changed, and I can’t tell if it’s just that we’re all being bombarded with the same content, or something’s qualitatively different about the world. A year ago it felt like crypto was sort of peripheral to the problems with the world, and now it feels like it’s a big part of the solution. It’s very strange. And everyone sort of acknowledges that. Donald Trump Jr. was there—that’s a big changeover where you just feel it’s some top-down policy as opposed to just—like, some weeks ago, Putin made his comments about how the United States was trying to use stablecoins to export American inflation, which is probably true, but that’s a big turnaround. And you felt that at the conference as well.

**[07:03] SPEAKER_02:** Well, I mean, that wasn’t new on the Bitcoin conference side. So I was in Nashville 2014—and Vegas, sorry: 2014, 2020, 2024—and then this July in Vegas. So in Nashville last year you had Trump, RFK Jr. Then this year you had both Trump boys. Donald Jr. and Eric were both there, and, oh my goodness, I’m forgetting his name from the UK—it will come to me in a second. But yeah, and also tons of other Congress people and state-level stuff. That’s been a real theme well in advance on the Bitcoin side. I mean, I guess essentially because you’ve already got that monetary store-of-value use case. It’s like getting into these boring ETF, treasury company, government-level adoption sort of stuff. That happened earlier on the Bitcoin side than more generally. But yeah, also obviously the Trumps have got their World Liberty nonsense going on, and they’ve got to be pumping that one.

**[08:28] SPEAKER_00:** Well, actually that’s a good transition. Internally, we were trying to decide whether the conference was more boring or more crazy than usual. You kind of have talked about the boring elements—more institutional. And I’m curious: since this is in Singapore, a very global conference, what countries outside the US seem to be moving in this direction? Obviously the US has been a holdout for a really long time, but how are things getting boring, and how are things getting more global?

**[09:05] SPEAKER_01:** Bob, I want to remind you not to criticize our friends in Washington—at least in a public forum—supporters of the—

**[09:15] SPEAKER_02:** I’m not getting back in—

**[09:19] SPEAKER_01:** So yeah, it’s an interesting feel. The conference, I would say, obviously represented people who are close by pretty well, but also a good number of people in from, let’s say, UAE, some Europe. Plenty of Americans who did the really long trip—lots of Americans, I would say. And yeah, it’s a strange— the institutional feeling was much stronger than the prior year, and it’s not that much time to have passed. There were many—the stablecoins have this institutional feel to them. Even at the beginning, they didn’t. And it is funny to watch: I see these announcements, like Tether’s coming to the US, and “we’ve set up a nice regulatory framework that they can work with.” And I went to a side event and met some of the Tether people. It’s also just funny to see them in the media buying sports teams and all of that. At a certain point you get big enough, you become institutional.

**[10:26] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Right.

**[10:28] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, I think it even—last year it felt like blockchain technology at the maybe lower levels of the stack disproportionately gets created in the broader West, right? And maybe with the exception of some of the exchanges and such. And then it gets used outside the West more. So you see stablecoin balances: yes, they’re big in the US, but it’s kind of really a global story. Tether in particular being much larger than Circle, obviously. I think both of them—Tether purports not to serve the US; I’m sure there’s plenty of US USDT holders. Circle maybe preference-ing the US but probably covers global as well. It’s a funny feeling in which the people at the conference are a little more like users than builders. And there’s also just—I mean, the feel of Token is a little like someone described it to me: kind of like Comic Con. And I thought that was actually very apt. There’s people in funny outfits—like astronauts. You could take yourself as an astronaut with Justin Sun pictures—I think Bob has one—and lots of shiny outfits. And I think the world’s tallest man was there, sadly in a wheelchair. I think he has a hard time standing, at least for long periods of time. You saw this horse in a wheelchair. I was like, “No, that’s a human.” Like a really large— I don’t know, 8'6" or 7'10" or so. Like a really large human being.

**[12:15] SPEAKER_00:** Well, he probably has to be in a wheelchair just so he doesn’t bump his head on every door frame that is out there. You know what I mean?

**[12:23] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so the mix—definitely big global conference. I think they usually get the number you hear is like 20-ish thousand people, coming from hubs. Again, a lot of UAE. Some of the European hubs. And big US contingents. Very long flight for us. But yeah, it was great. Singapore also just a great place to hang out, and pretty good representation of the global scene, if you will. There’s also a—I don’t know if this perfectly ties into the global amount—there’s the feeling that the same people are manning the booths last year and this year. I’ve also heard: very expensive conference. But the companies have, in many cases, changed—except for the very big ones, you know, the headliners, people get invited to the stage, etc. A lot of turnover in who was represented at the conference. So, in some ways, being a media company is one of the better ways to survive cycles in crypto. Someone will pay that big conference figure.

**[13:33] SPEAKER_00:** And it seems those fees are getting bigger and bigger too, right? It’s just very, very—

**[13:40] SPEAKER_01:** Cool garbage.

**[13:44] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah. And we don’t want to keep you too long. Obviously, you’ve got important things to do around the house. Bob, what do you think about the global and the boring part of it?

**[13:56] SPEAKER_02:** So yeah, I mean, I guess just something else to say: I have been to a lot of conferences. I’ve never seen somewhere with so much floor space of expo halls, just on and on and on. Honestly, like city blocks—many, many city blocks worth of stuff. And then you go, “Alright, yeah, there’s another whole floor of this.” Yeah, yeah, it’s twice as much as you thought.

**[14:24] SPEAKER_00:** Even bigger than Devcon in Thailand last year? Because I remember looking—getting my step tracker—and seeing like, “Oh man, I’m 15,000 steps in the conference center.”

**[14:36] SPEAKER_02:** Bigger in terms of the expo area, certainly. Devcon was a large floor area, but it was lots and lots of different rooms of talks, and then little stores. Whereas this is just expo hall of selling. I don’t know what most of them were—thousands and thousands of projects that you’ve never heard of doing a thing that is pretty indistinguishable from everybody else. So yeah, talking about the turnover, Kieren on me—and I’m sure that’s the case—the vast majority of them are going to be gone in a year’s time, and we’ll never even know they happened.

**[15:16] SPEAKER_00:** But so do you guys think the boringness comes from institutions themselves, or what they’re doing? Because everyone seems to be doing stablecoin or treasury company. Those seem to be the two options.

**[15:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think it’s a strange thing in which the meme coins ended to some degree with the US elections. And I feel like Libra was really the end, in which a coin associated with a public official did pretty badly for—

**[15:52] SPEAKER_02:** The people involved.

**[15:56] SPEAKER_01:** Excuse me.

**[15:58] SPEAKER_00:** And sorry, I thought you were talking about the Facebook Libra.

**[16:02] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, no. Yeah, the melee associated—

**[16:08] SPEAKER_02:** There’s a Hawk Tuah coin as well, wasn’t there?

**[16:11] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think that was before, though. I feel like that was not the end. But yes, it’s sort of—I think they’ve kind of peaked. pump.fun still seems to be doing lots and lots of launches and revenue. But no one’s really talking that much about it anymore. And we’re getting back to something like: you either have to have tech, or now you have to have revenue. And it’s gotten almost like a mirror of the public equity markets, in which people are—you know, something I might want to talk about at more length another time: I keep seeing criticism of Uniswap because they generate a lot of fees, but a lot of those fees go directly to the lab company and they don’t go to the protocol. And they have to turn the protocol fees on and would then start, theoretically, buying back the token. Whereas folks like Hyperliquid—there’s no lab skim, and there are pretty big buybacks going on, and the token price has gone up. And people argue Uniswap has a kind of conflict of interest there. But anyway, the point being: suddenly it all became about revenue, US dollar-denominated yields, like how to do not quite a SPAC-like—most of these treasury companies are an existing publicly traded company. And there’s maybe not a formal takeover with a change of control, but usually an injection of capital, that the company’s doing something else right now and then it starts digital asset treasury operations. There was a panel—Tom Lee gave a lot of numbers on how big his digital asset treasury company is, what chunk of ETH it holds now, what the trend is, all that sort of thing. And they’ve— I guess Michael Saylor kind of pioneered—I don’t know if he was there; I don’t think he was—some of the financial engineering that creatively let him acquire as much Bitcoin as possible. And all these folks are then kind of in the—I would argue—a part of the TradFi mindset. People make complicated products that sort of favor the house, in a sense, so that no matter what, the client has an idea, but the institution does okay, right? And some analog of that is going on. People are purchasing—a lot of the time you would just want to hold tokens directly as opposed to invest in a digital assets treasury, I guess. I think the digital asset treasuries may be better than the ETFs. The ETFs promise to do nothing and charge a fee, where the digital asset treasuries don’t really charge a fee and maybe do something creative. So it’s like the entrance of a new venue of financial engineering. But I also think they’re kind of brilliant in the following sense: it’s a tremendous pain to be a publicly traded US company. It’s expensive, there’s a lot of compliance burden. So tokens are out there; they get liquidity in some ways. You might want liquidity from the US public equity markets for your token. You could do this by IPO-ing a company like Coinbase is sort of a vehicle for that. But then you’ve got to report on the extremely complicated operations of Coinbase and its whatever—thousand employees. Or you could just have a thing buy the token, and then you never have to IPO the labs company, and you can kind of just get all of the capital without the much heavier reporting burden of being a publicly traded actual company. And this is kind of genius. It’s a great way to bring in more bigger, more boring, more conservative capital while not changing the premise that much. So yeah, the suits are good at that, and the digital asset treasuries provide a good wrapper for the thing that probably most of us would hold as spot.

**[20:43] SPEAKER_00:** By the way, we have a comment from Sheba who says he loves your take on meme ecosystems. Yeah, not surprisingly has their own meme ecosystem.

**[20:55] SPEAKER_01:** You gotta hold all the memes. That’s the key.

**[20:57] SPEAKER_00:** Shout out to Yoshima. Bob, so what do you think about treasuries and stablecoins?

**[21:04] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I mean, I guess this is all sort of maturity, and it’s a strange kind of feeling. Looking back on all of our joint experience on enterprise Ethereum efforts kicking off in 2016, 2017, and really the thought there that all of these public and private use cases could all be met by suitably modular code bases and thinking EVMs. And here we are: you’ve got Stripe announcing Tempo and having a consortium of companies doing that kind of payments setup. And then you’ve got NASDAQ announcing equities on-chain again with a Besu derivative. And then you’ve got Base and Coinbase. And all of these things are happening in a very similar kind of form to what we were shooting for all that time back. And that’s—while these things are kind of a bit boring—it is also quite amazing that we’ve got to that place that these very conservative incumbents have caught up without thinking. Yeah, it’s pretty amazing.

**[22:43] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I think part of it, and maybe one of the reasons as builders we find it boring, is that effectively there are no tech innovations really that are driving this, right? It’s really about people who already have a bunch of money pouring more money into it.

**[23:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I felt the seams of it at a time. I think much of the space was extremely eager for institutional approval, even with some nominal hostility to it. And I now feel the emotion that I almost don’t want it. I’m like, “Get out of here.” I want it to go back. I guess I’m happy maybe about the asset values, although it’s not my primary motivation at all. But I hope that they don’t—because the thing you see with the Web2 world: while the internet remains at least kind of open, the people use like six apps. And so it’s pretty easy to affect the whole planet of users of the internet just through these six apps.

**[24:04] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[24:04] SPEAKER_01:** And it could easily happen that way in crypto, where crypto itself remains totally open, but as a—for instance: the company—we have a Coinbase account which we use a little bit—and they are way more difficult and onerous and making information requests all the time than any bank I’ve dealt with. It’s bizarre. They tried to introduce a whitelist for the accounts you could send out to. This is like a month ago. Apparently you could turn this feature off, and it’s “for your protection,” in case someone’s gotten in there. But it’s like you’re worse than the thing you said you were setting out to destroy from an “is it our money” perspective, and that feels—I’m happy that the GENIUS Act passed, I think, but it also has that feel too. Coinbase itself is now in a fight with the banks. Like, “Wait, we didn’t mean you could do this, that we wanted all yield bans,” so—

**[25:22] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, well, I mean, they do get leaned on more than the banks, though, right? Because they’re kind of in this new area. So all of this stuff is just very rigid and defined, and the borders never move on the bank side. But then on a crypto exchange side it’s kind of a bit of both. So they’re always going to be moving around a bit, and they’re always going to get whipped down.

**[25:47] SPEAKER_01:** I think fintechs in general—they’re maybe a little leaner, probably a little faster on things than the banks. And it almost feels like they’re overzealous in terms of their compliance posture because they feel that they can get kicked around. Like the banks are just a little less worried. The banks are—tons of them have been leaned on too, right, in very much the same way, but it seems like a slower and less aggressive process somehow.

**[26:19] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, well, I mean—sorry—I mean because they’re generally not trying to do new things, right? The fintechs are moving around, so it might be like, “We’re all compliant and good today, but then we might be doing a new thing next week, and oh no, they don’t like that, so we better be on good behavior, get the brownie points.” Whereas the banks are very rarely doing anything new and different, so they don’t really worry so much, I don’t think.

**[26:46] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean I kind of feel like what we’ve really seen is: regulation was like the lid on a bucket, and the minute you move that lid, the demand—the real level of demand that we’re seeing now—is what sort of always existed, but it’s just been held back for really long.

**[27:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I don’t know if you ever said the Circle IPO was kind of crazy. It showed, you know, just how much it went up after listing, like how much pent-up demand is out there if this is even slightly allowed.

**[27:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And I feel like the treasury companies are a similar thing, right? All of those things. Well, while we’re getting to that point: how do you think things are getting a little bit crazier than last year?

**[27:29] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, things are happening fast. The turnover is still huge in the space. I would say there are still lots of good new projects that feel like they come out of nowhere and are pretty successful. I’m friends socially with the CEO of Lighter, and he told me about it like a year and a half ago or two. I read the paper, I was like, “Okay, I kind of get it,” like circuits for matching and so on. It’s huge now. And then the DEX wars are just sort of heating up. The perp DEX—there’s like a new perp DEX every minute. Yeah, I think the pace at which things can happen seems to just be accelerating. And the cycles: I was talking to a friend who’s kind of an investor, kind of runs an incubator sort of thing, and he said that he’s done better not thinking about it as a four-year cycle anymore because it feels like they’re compressing, and there are mini-cycles within the cycle. And yeah, I suppose everything is heating up in that way.

**[28:49] SPEAKER_00:** I’ll—

**[28:51] SPEAKER_01:** A friend of ours made a joke. So in the US—probably in Canada—or we do not have a booth-babe culture. Maybe I’d heard that this existed, you know—

**[29:04] SPEAKER_00:** This used to exist. As someone who’s gone to—

**[29:07] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, we had one.

**[29:09] SPEAKER_00:** Like practically illegal.

**[29:13] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. I think booth babes are gone, but Token was very much like a booth-babe conference. And in fact, they were seemingly more of them than last year. And then this led to: does this mean we’re near the top? Like is the price speculation at a maximum at this moment? It wasn’t euphoria, but people were feeling pretty good. And I like a conference when people are feeling a little shitty.

**[29:47] SPEAKER_00:** Right, because—

**[29:48] SPEAKER_01:** Because then you know there’s room for things to run. I think for better or for worse, interest in the industry as a whole just trends upwards with prices. So it’s good for us for prices to go up. But yeah, I could see it. I think the digital asset treasuries too are also evidence that it’s kind of late cycle. But even still, stuff is just happening really quickly. I think products mostly work in crypto now. There’s a strange moment where DeFi just worked, and this is part of the reason we really got into it. It definitely only kind of worked through 2021, 2022, maybe even 2023. And then it just kind of functions, and it’s big. Every week or so I see one of the “a people” tweet like how big it would be compared to the US banks, and it’s like 47, 43, 36, you know—it’s running. And so there’s a feeling of inevitability that kicked in for me a couple months ago that I’ve never quite felt.

**[31:11] SPEAKER_00:** What about you, Bob? What did you find on the craziness level? What do you think is—I can’t—

**[31:20] SPEAKER_02:** I must have been in the right bit of the building. I didn’t see any booth babes. Where were they? Lots of people in the costumes, like the mascots or what have you. But something else I was thinking, which is good talking about top signals: there wasn’t an excess of Ripple representation. Because that’s always a good top sign, right? If there’s lots of interest in XRP, that signals new entries into the market.

**[32:02] SPEAKER_01:** I wonder if that’s changed. It used to be—the joke that I’ve both experienced in my face-to-face life and on crypto Twitter: when your dentist or realtor friend asks you about what you think about Cardano or Ripple, then it’s time to sell, you know. But—

**[32:25] SPEAKER_02:** There was plenty of Charles.

**[32:27] SPEAKER_01:** There’s plenty.

**[32:28] SPEAKER_02:** There was plenty, plenty of Charles, but no Ripplers.

**[32:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[32:33] SPEAKER_01:** I wonder what it was. I think BNB flipped XRP recently.

**[32:39] SPEAKER_02:** They did. I just saw that. Yeah, up to number three.

**[32:45] SPEAKER_01:** Amazing.

**[32:45] SPEAKER_00:** How are you guys feeling about having been in the space for so long that long-term projects like MetaMask are now launching a token?

**[32:54] SPEAKER_01:** Oh yeah, yeah—that’s another part of the crazy. This is a good reminder. I think basically a lot was held back by uncertainty. So the high-quality stuff: a strange thing about the Gensler era was that it felt like at least the Eye of Sauron was on the good projects, and the bad projects, in a sense, were sort of left to run. And the good ones—so like any industry, if you looked at all of the businesses, most of them are bad. Most of them go out of business. And if you imagine if you made all the businesses publicly traded, most of the stocks would go to zero. So you would kind of expect in crypto that most tokens are bad. It’s sort of like what you would see if you just made essentially no barriers to entry to public listing stock. Not that tokens are stock, but anyway. However, if you kind of market-cap-weighted, you would probably find that the things near the top are pretty high quality. And then sometimes things will come out of the bottom and go into the top. But by and large, you should sort of forget about that long tail of things. And it did feel like, to a significant degree, the eye was on the big things and it tried to destroy them before there was a token, or freeze them, or what have you. And it left the bad stuff to run amok, contributing to the impression that the space was just all scams. And it might be all scams by number of projects—the average project might be a scam or just not worth any value, but the average business is not a good business. But the big ones are good most of the time—not all. And they’re kind of just being allowed out. Again, Circle IPO, good example. MetaMask token—it’s like probably they should have had one a long time ago. For a long time they probably wanted a token.

**[35:08] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I remember the height of this for me was when the SEC filed charges against Binance and Coinbase in the same week. It’s like, “We’re just gonna look at something with the word exchange in it and then go after that,” right? It’s like the most compliant exchange and the least compliant exchange.

**[35:27] SPEAKER_02:** No, no. I mean, the other thing that you had there was: it was the good actors that were getting the legal action, basically because the good actors were staying onshore and trying to work through the thing and get to a resolution, whereas all the baddies are just like, “Yeah, we’re out of here. We’re not serving US people. We’re scam away. We’re not even going to make any effort to be compliant of anything, and you can’t get us.” So it was almost by definition that the good actors were the ones that got whacked, because they stayed around to get whacked and kept coming back for more and more whacking until the whacking ceased eventually. But yeah. I mean I think another crazy thing is I think we’re going to have masses of ICOs, like tons and tons of them coming up.

**[36:24] SPEAKER_00:** Well, on that, I think we’ve crossed the 30-minute mark. I want to ask you guys: do you have any closing thoughts about Token2049 or where we’re at in the overall state of blockchain?

**[36:39] SPEAKER_01:** One thing I would say: I was reminded food is excellent in Singapore, if you—hawker markets. There was a hawker market in the conference. It was kind of crazy. They made one; it was very cool. I’m pretty optimistic. These are good times. A lot of work ahead, obviously, I think. But yeah, it feels like it was a good marker of some sort of tipping point. Again, for a couple months I’ve been feeling the inevitability, kind of based—even though parts of me don’t like it—on the institutional buy-in. It’s gotten to the point where I think they don’t just roll it back like they did last time. Customers are demanding it, and people who said they’d never custody crypto just stood it up quickly, and it’s probably too intermingled now to really remove. If sentiment changes towards crypto in the US and elsewhere, then there’s a lot of thinking to do about completing the product, so to speak. It’s a strange thing in which retail was in for a while and maybe got burned, kind of culminating with FTX. It probably hasn’t come back all that much, and the institutions are in now, which means that retail will eventually come back. And we cannot burn retail again. It just has to be better than— I think one of the things we think about is the absolute experience as a totality has to be better than whatever service it’s displacing: banking, FX, exchanges, whatever. It’s not all financial services, obviously, but a lot of them are. And this includes things like making sure people don’t lose the keys somehow, or what have you. So there’s a needle that’s right there. But I think that’s going to be a lot of what the next phase is about.

**[38:59] SPEAKER_00:** Bob, what do you think?

**[39:01] SPEAKER_02:** Well, I mean, I think the way that will happen for a lot of retail is that they’re not going to have their hands on it directly. It’ll all be through these instruments. So their experience is just, “Oh yeah, I’ve got a brokerage account and there’s those in it as well,” but they kind of look indistinguishable to commodities or equities or bonds or anything else. It’s just, yeah, there’s some more financial instruments. So I think that’s your speculative retail crypto-as-an-investment people. What I think is going to be more interesting to watch is the payments side, especially with the Stripe project there. If you get to a place where lots of regular payment flows can be using crypto rather than fiat, that’s really interesting. You can start getting real velocity of non-speculative use. Because everything really at this point has pretty much been speculation, or a little bit of payments, but not really any large volume of payments. Early on it’s like “Buy your coffee with Bitcoin,” and that didn’t last very long, and that kind of hasn’t really come back. But really with the stablecoins and these large integrations—like PayPal as well, PayPal are doing things, Mastercard have announced stuff—I’m sure all of these payment rails are going to be joining in on the game, and that really changes things.

**[40:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, and one question: are we going to Devconnect? I know me and Bob have already bought our tickets. Kieren, you’re the holdout. Can I get a commitment?

**[40:54] SPEAKER_01:** I’m still a “probably.” One: I’ve never been to Argentina. I really do want to go, but—

**[41:04] SPEAKER_00:** I really want to see what’s going on. Yeah, I haven’t been to South America and I really want to see what’s happening in the crypto world over there, because you hear a lot about it. Obviously there are big exchanges and big projects there, so I’m really curious to find out.

**[41:17] SPEAKER_01:** Vitalik said he’s more likely to get recognized in Buenos Aires than in the US, I’d say.

**[41:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And so if you like this content, please join us. Every week we have this at the same time. Follow us on Twitter at Strato Mercado—with an “a”—and join our Telegram community. Bob, if they want to hear more from you, where can they find you?

**[41:40] SPEAKER_02:** Yep. So I’m just Bob Summerwill—same as my name—on Twitter.

**[41:46] SPEAKER_00:** And Kieren, where can people find you?

**[41:49] SPEAKER_01:** K James Lubin—so shortened—but my name also on Twitter/X.

**[41:57] SPEAKER_00:** And you can find me at Vic4Wong on Twitter. Bob and Kieren have both shamed me publicly because I have so few followers, even though I was an early adopter. So please, please connect to me. I’d love to hear from you.

**[42:12] SPEAKER_02:** What’s the four about? What’s the Vic4?

**[42:16] SPEAKER_00:** So four is a number that no Chinese person likes because it sounds suspiciously like death. So it’s—you know, back in the world of eight-character usernames, I could always get Vic4Wong, because having an Asian name with the number 4 in it pretty much guaranteed that I could get it.

**[42:42] SPEAKER_01:** Always doing things the wrong way.

**[42:44] SPEAKER_00:** Exactly. I never heard that joke before. Okay, thank you, everyone. See you again next week. Take care.

**[42:51] SPEAKER_02:** Cheers, guys.
