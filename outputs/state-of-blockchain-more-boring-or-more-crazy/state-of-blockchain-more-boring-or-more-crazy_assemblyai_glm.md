**[00:03] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, I think we are live.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_01:** Live to us.

**[00:12] SPEAKER_00:** Let's just give a minute for people to join.

**[00:16] SPEAKER_01:** Alrighty.

**[00:24] SPEAKER_02:** So I looked at the background noise reduction. It says not supported in this browser. I'm using Firefox. Perhaps it has to be Chrome.

**[00:33] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[00:36] SPEAKER_01:** You must pick from the two available choices.

**[00:40] SPEAKER_00:** Safari. Yeah, Safari has a huge amount just because of the iPhone.

**[00:49] SPEAKER_01:** Is it called Edge still?

**[00:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_02:** Nobody uses Edge. Nobody uses it.

**[00:56] SPEAKER_01:** I bet you it's a lot. Hold on.

**[00:59] SPEAKER_02:** I seem to remember seeing, and I can't remember it was on Edge or Bing or probably both. But the most searched thing was how to install Chrome.

**[01:10] SPEAKER_01:** That's funny. Try though. They might. Wow. Chrome just continues to rise in market share. It's gone from 66% roughly about a year ago to 72% now worldwide. Safari is trending down. Yeah, they're just pretty tiny. Wow. Opera is still around. That's amazing.

**[01:40] SPEAKER_02:** They all use Chromium though.

**[01:42] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, fair enough.

**[01:45] SPEAKER_00:** Oddly, my son uses Opera. Okay, we are live now on Twitter.

**[01:51] SPEAKER_01:** Live. Live.

**[01:53] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, so should we, should we wait another minute or should we just start?

**[02:03] SPEAKER_01:** That's a good question. We can, we can ease into the substance of the content. Do we have any minute long non sequiturs?

**[02:16] SPEAKER_00:** Well, maybe we should do our intros because we...

**[02:19] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, we could do the intros. So.

**[02:22] SPEAKER_00:** Hi everyone. Welcome to our weekly show. If you don't know, we are all part of the Strato Mercado project that is a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain focused on bringing DeFi to the masses. Now we, the three of us here, are all longtime builders and all Ethereum OGs. I'm Victor Wong. Vic.

**[02:49] SPEAKER_01:** I don't know if you can describe yourself as an OG. I think someone else has to describe.

**[02:54] SPEAKER_00:** Someone else to bestow that.

**[02:55] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly.

**[02:56] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, you two. No, you.

**[02:59] SPEAKER_02:** Can we say it to each other?

**[03:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[03:01] SPEAKER_01:** Can we say you are an OG?

**[03:04] SPEAKER_00:** But. But yeah, I said that as a...

**[03:06] SPEAKER_01:** Collection in a circle.

**[03:07] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Exactly.

**[03:08] SPEAKER_01:** You can tell Bob. Bob's an OG. Bob can tell me. I can tell you.

**[03:12] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. So we've been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey. So you'll get hopefully no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we're going to talk about today. Today we are going to talk about the highlights from Token 2049 and was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world? Joining me is Bob Summerwill. Bob, you want to do a quick intro?

**[03:46] SPEAKER_02:** Hi there, I'm Bob Summerwill. We are not old, we're all very experienced. But yes, I'm head of ecosystem.

**[03:58] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And Kieren, of course.

**[04:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I am also experienced. You know, not as long as you can be in the space, but it's starting to feel like it. Right. Like we've really been around for some time. But yes, I'm...

**[04:14] SPEAKER_00:** I will bestow the OG title on you, Kieren. So we could go. I mean, anyone that's been around since before the launch of Ethereum and was part of it, I think, you know, that would be. We can claim that title.

**[04:31] SPEAKER_01:** How the time goes.

**[04:34] SPEAKER_00:** So I will say that I was not in Singapore. I kind of played hooky with Kieren's approval. You know, international travel is brutal, but Bob and Kieren were there. And why? To get your kind of impressions. What do you think the big themes this year were at Token 2049?

**[04:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Bunch of big topics. One thing that was notable is that it felt like meme coins had almost completely vanished. And there was a lot of that the previous year.

**[05:13] SPEAKER_00:** And can I pour one out for the meme coins?

**[05:15] SPEAKER_01:** Basically, in meme coins defense, I'm actually kind of pro meme coin. The problem is just the time horizon that people want to make money in, like, seconds. Like, I think if a meme around a concept, if it can kind of grow organically for some period of time is like, great.

**[05:34] SPEAKER_02:** But...

**[05:34] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, it's just the impatience and nihilism seems to increase with each cycle. But maybe, maybe not this one. So conference felt kind of less scammy in general. And a lot of digital asset treasury talk, I think we can go into that as we go. A lot of stablecoin talk, you know, a lot of, you know, merger with TradFi sort of feel. I also think something has changed. And I can't tell, like, if it's just that we're all being bombarded with the same content or something's qualitatively different about the world. Where like a year ago it felt like the crypto was sort of peripheral to the problems with the world. And now it feels like it's like a big part of the solution. It's very strange. And everyone sort of acknowledges that, you know, like Donald Trump Jr. was there. Like, that's a big changeover where you just feel, you know, like some weeks ago, like, Putin made his comments about, like, how the United States was trying to use stablecoins to export American inflation, which is probably true, but it's like that's a big turnaround. It's like a from the top policy as opposed to just. And you felt that at the conference as well.

**[07:03] SPEAKER_02:** Well, I mean that, that wasn't new on the, on the Bitcoin conference side. So I was in Nashville 2014 and Vegas. Sorry, 2014, 2020, 2024 and then, and then this July in Vegas. So in Nashville last year you had Trump RFK Jr then this year you had both Trump boys. Ben Jr and Eric were both there and oh my goodness, I'm forgetting his name from the UK. It will come to me in a second. But yeah, and, and also, you know, like tons of other Congress people and state level stuff like that's been a real theme well in advance on the Bitcoin side. I mean, I guess essentially because you've just already got that monetary store of value use case. It's like getting into these boring ETF, you know, treasury company, government level adoption sort of stuff that that's happened earlier than on the Bitcoin side than more generally. But yeah, also I mean obviously like the Trumps have got their world Liberty nonsense going on and gotta be pumping that one.

**[08:28] SPEAKER_00:** Well, actually that's a good transition. So you know, we couldn't. Internally we were trying to decide whether the conference was more boring or more crazy than usual. You kind of have talked about the boring elements, I guess, you know, more institutional. And I'm curious like, you know, since this is in Singapore, a very global conference. Like what countries outside the US seem to be moving in this direction? You know, like obviously the US has been a holdout for a really long time, but you know, how are things getting boring and how are things getting more global?

**[09:05] SPEAKER_01:** Bob, I want to remind you not to criticize our friends in Washington, at least in a public forum.

**[09:15] SPEAKER_02:** I'm not getting back in.

**[09:19] SPEAKER_01:** So the, yeah, so it's an interesting feel the, the conference, I would say it obviously represented people who are close by pretty well, but also, you know, some, a good number of people in from let's say UAE, some Europe. Plenty of Americans who did the really long trip. Lots, lots of Americans I would say. And yeah, I think it's a strange. The institutional feeling was much stronger than the prior year and it's, it's not that much time to have passed. Like there were many, you know, the stablecoin. Stablecoins have this institutional feel to them. Even you know, at the beginning they, they didn't. And it is funny to watch. Like, you know, I see these announcements, like, you know, Tether's coming to the US and we've, you know, set up a nice regulatory framework that, you know, they can, they can work with. And I went to a side event and met some of the Tether people. It's also just funny to see them, you know, in the, in the media, like buying sports teams and know all of that. Like at a certain point you get big enough, you become institutional.

**[10:26] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right.

**[10:28] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, I think, you know, the, it even last year it felt like blockchain technology at the, maybe at the lower levels of the stack disproportionately gets created in the broader West. Right. And maybe that with the exception of some of the exchanges and such, and it gets used outside the west more. So you see stablecoin balances, yes, they're big in the US but it's kind of really a global story. Tether in particular being like much larger than Circle. Obviously. I think both of them, you know, Tether purports not to serve the US I'm sure there's plenty of US USDT holders. Circle maybe preferencing the US but probably covers global as well. It's a. Yeah. So the, I think it's a funny feeling in which the part the people at the conference are a little more like users than builders. And there's also just, I mean the feel Token is a little like someone described it to me, kind of like Comic Con. And I thought that was actually very apt. Like there's people in funny. Like, you know, they're like astronauts. You could take yourself as an astronaut with Justin Sun pictures. I think Bob has one and like lots of like shiny outfits. And I think the world's tallest man was there sadly in a wheelchair. I think he has a hard time standing. Yes. For at least for long periods of time. It was like you saw this like horse in a wheelchair. I was like, no, that's a human. Like, you know, like, like a really large, I don't know, 86 or 7'10 or so. Like a really large human being.
