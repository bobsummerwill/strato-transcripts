SPEAKER_00: Okay, I think we are live. Live? Us? Let's just give a minute for people to join. All righty. So, I looked at the background noise reduction. It says not supported in this browser. I'm using Firefox. Perhaps it has to be Chrome.

SPEAKER_01: Yes, you must pick from the two available choices. Safari? Yeah, Safari has a huge amount just because of the iPhone. Is Edge still called Edge? Yes. Nobody uses Edge. Nobody. I bet you it's a lot. Hold on. I seem to remember seeing, and I can't remember if it was on Edge or Bing or probably both, but the most searched thing was how to install Chrome. That's funny. Try though; they might. Chrome just continues to rise in market share. It's gone from 66% roughly about a year ago to 72% now worldwide. Safari is trending down. Opera is still around. They all use Chromium, though. Okay. Fair enough. Oddly, my son uses Opera. Okay, we are live now on Twitter. Live live. Okay. So, should we wait another minute or should we just start? That's a good question. We can ease into the substance of the content. Do we have any minute-long non-sequiturs? Code opens. Well, maybe we should do our intros because we could do the intros.

SPEAKER_02: So, hi everyone. Welcome to our week show. If you don't know, we are all part of the Strato Mercato project, which is a layer one EVM compatible blockchain focused on bringing DeFi to the masses. Now, the three of us here are all longtime builders and all Ethereum OGs. I'm Victor Wong. Vic, I don't know if you can describe yourself as an OG. I think someone else has to describe it. Someone has to bestow that title. Exactly. Okay, you two are OGs. Can we say it to each other? Yeah, can we say it to each other? You are an OG. I said that as a collective. In a circle. Right, exactly. You can tell Bob. Bob's an OG. Bob can tell me. I can tell you. Yes. So, we've been building since the launch of Ethereum and continue to follow this journey. So, you'll get, hopefully, no shilling and a lot of good historical context about what we're going to talk about today. And today, we are going to talk about the highlights from Token 2049. Was it more boring or more crazy in terms of the blockchain world? Joining me is Bob Summerwill. Bob, you want to do a quick intro? Hi there, I'm Bob Summerwill. We are all very experienced. Thank you. But yes, I'm head of ecosystem. And Karen, of course. Yeah, I am also experienced; not as long as you can be in the space, but it's starting to feel like it, right? Like we've really been around for some time. But yes, I'm Kieren James-Lubin. I will bestow the OG title on you, Karen. So, we could go. I mean, anyone that's been around since before the launch of Ethereum and was part of it, I think, you know, that would be we can claim that title. How time goes. So, I will say that I was not in Singapore. I kind of played hooky with Karen's approval. International travel is brutal. But Bob and Karen were there. So, let's get your kind of impressions. What do you think the big themes this year were at Token 2049? Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Bunch of big topics. One thing that was notable is that it felt like meme coins had almost completely vanished. And there was a lot of that the previous year. Can I pour one out for the meme coins, basically? In meme coins' defense, I'm actually kind of pro-meme coin. The problem is just the time horizon. People want to make money in seconds. I think if a meme around a concept can kind of grow organically for some period of time, it's like great. But yeah, it's just the impatience and nihilism seems to increase with each cycle. But maybe not this one. So, the conference felt kind of less scammy in general and a lot of digital asset treasury talk. I think we can go into that as we go. A lot of stablecoin talk. A lot of merger with TradFi sort of feel. I also think something has changed, and I can't tell if it's just that we're all being bombarded with the same content or something's qualitatively different about the world. A year ago, it felt like crypto was sort of peripheral to the problems with the world. And now it feels like it's a big part of the solution. Very strange. And everyone sort of acknowledged that; Donald Trump Jr. was there. That's a big change. Some weeks ago, Putin made comments about how the United States was trying to use stablecoins to export American inflation, which is probably true. But it's like that's a big turnaround from the top policy level.

SPEAKER_00: Well, that wasn't new on the Bitcoin conference side. So, I was in Nashville 2014, Vegas 2020, 2024, and then this July in Vegas. In Nashville last year, you had Trump, RFK Jr., and then this year, you had both Trump boys, Ben junior and Eric. Nobody's name is coming to me right now, but yeah, and also, you know, tons of other congress people and state-level stuff. That's been a real theme in advance on the Bitcoin side. I guess essentially because you've just already got that monetary store of value use case. It's like getting into these boring ETF, treasury company, government-level adoption sort of stuff that happened earlier than on the Bitcoin side than more generally. But yeah, also, obviously, like the Trumps have got their World Liberty nonsense going on and got to be pumping that one.

SPEAKER_02: Well, actually, that's a good transition. Internally, we were trying to decide whether the conference was more boring or more crazy than usual. You kind of have talked about the boring elements, I guess, more institutional. And I'm curious, since this is in Singapore, a very global conference, what countries outside the U.S. seem to be moving in this direction? You know, like obviously the U.S. has been a holdout for a really long time. But how are things getting boring and how are things getting more global? Bob, I want to remind you not to criticize our friends in Washington, at least in a public forum.

SPEAKER_01: So, it's an interesting feel. The conference obviously represented people who were close by pretty well, but also a good number of people from, let's say, UAE, some Europe, plenty of Americans who did the really long trip. Lots and lots of Americans, I would say. And yeah, I think it's a strange... the institutional feeling was much stronger than the prior year. And it's not that much time to have passed. Like, there were many... the stablecoin, stablecoins have this institutional feel to them, even at the beginning they didn't. And it is funny to watch announcements like Tether's coming to the US and setting up a nice regulatory framework that they can work with. And I went to a side event and met some of the Tether people. It's also just funny to see them in the media, like buying sports teams and all of that. At a certain point, you get big enough, you become institutional. But yeah, I think even last year, it felt like blockchain technology at the maybe lower levels of the stack disproportionately gets created in the broader West. And maybe that, with the exception of some of the exchanges and such, and it gets used outside the West more. So, you see stablecoin balances. Tether in particular being much larger than Circle. Obviously, I think both of them... Tether purports not to serve the US. I'm sure there's plenty of US USDT holders. Circle maybe preferences the US but probably covers global as well. It's a funny feeling in which the people at the conference are a little more like users than builders. And there's also just the feel; Token is a little like Comic-Con. People in funny costumes, like astronauts. You could take yourself as an astronaut with Justin Sun pictures. And lots of shiny outfits. And I think the world's tallest man was there. Sadly, in a wheelchair; he has a hard time standing for long periods. It was like a horse in a wheelchair. I was like, no, that's a human. A really large human being.

SPEAKER_02: You know, survive cycles in crypto. You know, just someone will pay that big conference fee. Yeah, and it seems those fees are getting bigger and bigger too; very expensive.

SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, I mean, I guess just something else to say is I've been to a lot of conferences. I've never seen somewhere with so much floor space of expo halls, just on and on and on, like honestly, like city blocks, many, many city blocks worth of stuff. Even bigger than DevCon in Thailand last year? Because I remember looking, getting my step tracker and seeing like, oh man, I have 15,000 steps in the conference center. Bigger in terms of the expo area, certainly. DevCon was a large floor area, but it was lots and lots of different rooms of talks and then little stalls. Whereas this is just an expo hall of selling. Thousands and thousands of projects that you've never heard of doing a thing that is pretty indistinguishable from everybody else.

SPEAKER_02: So, do you guys think the boringness comes from institutions themselves or what they're doing? Because everyone seems to be doing like stablecoin or treasury company; those seem to be the two options.

SPEAKER_01: Meme coins ended to some degree with the US elections. And I feel like Libra was really the end, in which a coin associated with a public official did pretty badly for the people involved. There's a hot terror coin as well, wasn't there? Yeah, I think it was before though. I feel like that was not the end, but yes, it's sort of... you've either got to have tech or now you have to have revenue. And it's gotten almost like a mirror of the public equity markets in which people are looking at revenue, US dollar-denominated yields. Most of these treasury companies are an existing publicly traded company, and there's maybe not a formal takeover with a change of control, but usually like an injection of capital that the company is doing something else right now. And then it starts digital asset treasury operations. Tom Lee gave a lot of numbers on how big his digital asset treasury company is, what chunk of ETH it holds, now what the trend is, all that sort of thing. And I guess Michael Saylor kind of pioneered some of the financial engineering that kind of creatively let him acquire as much Bitcoin as possible. And all these folks are then kind of in the TradFi mindset; people make complicated products that sort of favor the house. So, no matter what, the client has an idea, but the institution does okay. Some analog of that is going on; people are purchasing. A lot of the time, you would just want to hold tokens directly as opposed to invest in a digital assets treasury. I guess I think the digital asset treasuries may be better than the ETFs. The ETFs promise to do nothing and charge a fee, whereas the digital asset treasuries don't really charge a fee and maybe do something creative. It's the entrance of a new venue of financial engineering. But I also think they're kind of brilliant in the following sense: it's a tremendous pain to be a public traded US company; it's expensive, there's a lot of compliance burden. Tokens are out there; they get liquidity in some ways. You might want liquidity from the US public equity markets for your token. You could do this by IPOing a company like Coinbase is sort of a vehicle for that. But then you've got to report on the extremely complicated operations of Coinbase and its thousand employees. Or you could just have a thing by the token; never have to IPO the labs company, and you can kind of just get all of the capital without the much heavier reporting burden of being a publicly traded actual company. And this is like kind of genius; a great way to bring in more conservative capital while not changing the premise that much.

SPEAKER_02: By the way, we have a comment from Shiva who says he loves your take on meme ecosystems. Not surprisingly, someone who has their own meme ecosystem. You got to hold all the memes. That's the key. Shout out to you, Shiva. Bob, so what do you think about treasuries and stablecoins?

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean... I guess this is all sort of maturity. It's a strange kind of feeling looking back on our joint experience on enterprise Ethereum efforts kicking off in 2016, 2017, and really the thought that all of these public and private use cases could all be met by suitably modular codebases and thinking EVMs. And here we are; you've got Stripe announcing Tempo and having a consortium of companies doing that kind of payments setup. And then you've got NASDAQ announcing equities on-chain again with some derivative. And then you've got BASE and Coinbase and all of these things happening in a very similar kind of form to what we were shooting for all that time back. And that's, while these things are kind of a bit boring, it is also quite amazing that we've got to that place where these very conservative incumbents have caught up.

SPEAKER_02: Uh, conservative incumbents have caught up without thinking; it's pretty amazing. Well, I think part of it, and maybe one of the reasons as builders, we find it boring is that effectively there are no tech innovations really that are driving this; it's really about people who already have a bunch of money.

SPEAKER_01: Pouring more money into it. At a time, I think much of the space was extremely eager for institutional approval, even with some nominal hostility to it. And I now feel the emotion that I'm like, I almost don't want it. I'm like, get out of here. I want it to go back. I guess I'm happy maybe about the asset values, although it's not my primary motivation at all. But I hope that they don't, because the thing you see with the Web2 world, while the internet remains at least kind of open, the people use like six apps. And so it's just pretty easy to affect the whole planet of users of the internet just through these six apps. And I kind of... it could easily happen that way in crypto, where crypto itself remains totally open. But like, as a for instance, Coinbase has a Coinbase account, which we use a little bit, and they are way more difficult and onerous and making information requests all the time than any bank I've dealt with. It's bizarre. They try to introduce a whitelist for the accounts you could send out to. This was like a month ago. Apparently, you could turn this feature off, and it's for your protection in case someone's gotten in there. But it's like you're worse than the thing you said that you were setting out to destroy from an "is-it-our-money" perspective.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, I mean, I guess they do get leaned on more than the banks. So right, because they're kind of in this new energy area. So, all of this stuff is just very rigid and defined and borders never move on the bank side. But then on a crypto exchange side, it's kind of a bit of both. And so they're always going to be moving around a bit, and they're always going to get one down.

SPEAKER_01: I think fintechs in general are maybe a little leaner, probably a little faster on things than the banks. And it almost feels like they're overzealous in terms of their compliance posture because they feel that they can get kicked around in a way like the banks are just a little less worried. The banks are...

SPEAKER_00: You know, tons of them have been leaned on to write, and very much the same way. But it seems like a slower and less aggressive process somehow. Well, yeah, because they're not trying to do new things, right? The fintechs are moving around, so it might be like we're all compliant and good today, but then we might be doing a new thing next week.

SPEAKER_02: Whereas the banks are very rarely doing anything new and different. So, they don't really worry so much, I don't think. Yeah, I kind of feel like what we've really seen is just like regulation was like the lid on the bucket. And the minute you move that lid, the demand, like the real level of demand that we're seeing now, is what sort of always existed. But it's just been held back for a really long time.

SPEAKER_01: The Circle IPO was kind of crazy. It showed just how much pent-up demand is out there if this is even slightly allowed. And I feel like the treasury companies are a similar thing. While we're getting to that point, how do you think things are getting a little bit more crazier than last year? Yeah, things are happening fast. The turnover is still huge in the space. I would say there are still lots of good new projects that feel like they come out of nowhere and are pretty successful. The pace at which things can happen seems to just be accelerating. And the cycles... so I was talking to a friend who's kind of an investor, kind of runs an incubator sort of thing. And he said that he's done better not thinking about it as a four-year cycle anymore because it sort of feels like they're compressing, and they're kind of mini cycles within the cycle. Yeah, I suppose just everything is heating up in that way. A friend of ours sort of made a joke: Token was very much like a booth babe conference. And in fact, they were sort of like seemingly more of them than last year.

SPEAKER_00: I wasn't in the right bit of the building. I didn't see any booth babes. Where were they? I saw lots of people in costumes, mascots, or what have you. Something else I was just thinking is that there wasn't an excess of Ripple representation. That's always a good top sign, right? Is if there's lots of interest in XRP, that signals new entries into the market.

SPEAKER_01: I wonder if that's changed. It used to be like the joke that when your dentist or realtor friend asks you about Cardano or Ripple, then it's time to sell. There was plenty of Charles, but no Ripple. I wonder. I think BNB flipped XRP recently. They did. I just saw that. Up to number three. Amazing. How are you guys feeling about having been in the space for so long that long-term projects like MetaMask are now launching a token? Oh, yeah, yeah. This is another part of the crazy. I think basically just a lot was held back by uncertainty. And so the high-quality stuff... a strange thing about the Gensler era was that it felt like at least the eye of Sauron was on the good projects and the bad projects. In a sense, the bad ones were sort of left to run, and the good ones... so like any industry, if you looked at all of the businesses, most of them are bad. Most of them go out of business. And if you imagine if you made all the businesses publicly traded, most of the stocks would go to zero. So, you would kind of expect in crypto that like most tokens are bad. It's sort of like what you would see if you just made essentially no barriers to entry to publicly listing stock.

SPEAKER_02: Circle IPO, good example. MetaMask token. You know, it's like probably they should have had one a long time ago. Like they haven't used it for a long time. They probably wanted a token. Well, I remember the height of this for me was when the SEC filed charges against Binance and Coinbase in the same week. It's like we're just going to look at something with the word "exchange" in it and then go after that. No, it is.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, the other thing is that yeah, it was like the good actors that were getting the legal action. Basically, because the good actors were staying onshore and trying to work through the thing and get to a resolution. Whereas all the baddies are just like, yeah, we're out of here. We're not serving US people. We're scam away. We're not even going to make any effort to be compliant.

SPEAKER_02: Another crazy thing is I think we're going to have masses of ICOs, like tons and tons of them coming up. Well, on that, I think we've crossed the 30-minute mark. I wanted to ask you guys, do you have any closing thoughts about Token 2049 or where we're at in the overall state of blockchain?

SPEAKER_01: One thing I would say is that I was reminded that food is excellent in Singapore. For those who haven't been, there was a hawker market in the conference. It was kind of crazy. They made one; it was very cool. That's awesome. I'm pretty optimistic. These are good times. A lot of work ahead, obviously. I think it feels like it was a good marker of some sort of tipping point. Again, for a couple of months, I've been feeling the inevitability kind of based, even though parts of me don't like it, on the institutional buy-in. It's gotten to the point where I think they don't just roll it back like they did last time. Customers are demanding it. People who said they'd never custody crypto just stood it up quickly.

SPEAKER_00: Well, and I mean, I think the way that that will happen for a lot of retail is that they're not going to have their hands on directly. It'll all be through these instruments. So, their experience is just, oh yeah, I've got a brokerage account and there's those in it. I think that's your sort of speculative retail, crypto as an investment people. What I think is going to be more interesting to watch is the payments side. Especially with the Stripe project there, if you get to a place where lots of just regular payment flows can be using crypto rather than fiat, that's really interesting. You can start getting real velocity of non-speculative use.

SPEAKER_02: Um, and that really changes things. Yeah. And one question, are we going to DevConnect? I know me and Bob have already bought our tickets. Karen, you're the holdout. Can I get a commitment? I'm still a problem. Let me think about it. I've never been to Argentina. I really do want to go. Vitalik said he's more likely to get recognized in Buenos Aires than in the US. Yeah. Well, and so if you like this content, please join us every week. We have this at the same time. Follow us on Twitter at Straddle Mercato with an A, and join our Telegram community. Bob, if they want to hear more from you, where can they find you? Yeah, so I'm just Bob Summerwill on Twitter. And Kieren, where can people find you? Kieren James-Lubin on Twitter, shortened to just my name. You can find me at Vic4Wong on Twitter. Bob and Karen have both shamed me publicly because I have so few followers even though I was an early adopter. So, please connect to me. Love to hear from you. What about the Vic4Wong? Four is a number that no Chinese person likes because it sounds suspiciously like death. So, back in the world of eight-character usernames, I could always get Vic4Wong because having an Asian name with the number four in it pretty much guaranteed that I could get it. Always doing things the Wong way. Yeah. Exactly. Thank you, everyone. See you again next week. Take care. Cheers, guys.
