The user wants me to edit a raw transcript about the early days of Ethereum.
I need to follow specific rules:
1.  **No preamble/meta-commentary.** Start immediately with `[MM:SS] SPEAKER_XX:`.
2.  **Preserve all content.** No summarizing or condensing.
3.  **Output length must be 90-110% of input.**
4.  **Timestamps:** Preserve exact input timestamps, one per speaker turn.
5.  **Formatting:** Merge consecutive speech by one speaker into paragraphs separated by spaces (not line breaks within the paragraph). Use bold labels. Blank line between speakers. If one speaker has multiple paragraphs, subsequent paragraphs don't need the label/timestamp, just a blank line separation.
6.  **Corrections:**
    *   Fix technical terms (Ethereum, NFT, etc.).
    *   **Fix proper names using the provided list:**
        *   SPEAKER_00 introduces himself as "Bob Samuel". The "Key People" list has "Bob Summerwill". Wait, looking closely at the list: "Aaron Davis, Aaron Wright... Bob Summerwill...". Ah, wait, the speaker says "Bob Samuel here at Dark Prague". I need to check if "Bob Samuel" is in the list. No, "Bob Summerwill" is. However, the transcript says "Bob Samuel". "Dark Prague" sounds like "Devcon Prague". The speaker refers to himself as "Bob Samuel". I should probably correct the name to "Bob Summerwill" if that's the intended person (which is highly likely given the context of "Early Days of Ethereum" and the list provided). Let me look at the "Context - Ethereum Ecosystem Knowledge" list again. It lists "Bob Summerwill". The transcript says "Bob Samuel". This is likely a speech-to-text error. I will correct "Bob Samuel" to "Bob Summerwill".
        *   "Exalt server" -> This sounds like a name. Maybe "Michael Paranti". The speaker says "Exalt server Michael Paranti". "Exalt server" sounds like a title or a mishearing. Maybe "Executive Director"? Or just a name? Let's look at the name list. "Michael Paranti"? No. "Michael Paranti" is not in the list. "Mihai Alisie" is in the list (Vitalik co-founded Bitcoin Magazine with Mihai Alisie). The transcript says "Mihaly". I should correct "Mihaly" to "Mihai Alisie".
        *   "Grif" -> Maybe "Griff"? Not in list. I'll leave it unless obvious.
        *   "Mark Capellis" -> Mark Karpelès.
        *   "Charlie Schremm" -> Charlie Shrem.
        *   "Amir Tani" -> Amir Taaki.
        *   "Smari McCarthy" -> Smari McCarthy (in list).
        *   "Asta Fish" -> "Birgitta Jónsdóttir"? No, "Asta Fish" sounds like a name. Wait, looking at the list: "Smari McCarthy" is there. "Asta Fish" might be "Ásta Guðrún Helgadóttir"? Not in list. Or maybe "Andrew Keys"? No. Let's check "Asta Fish". It might be a speech-to-text error for a Pirate Party member. Maybe "Björgvin Sigurðsson"? No. I will keep "Asta Fish" if I can't identify the person in the list, but try to fix if obvious. Wait, looking at the list again: "Aeron Buchanan". Maybe "Asta Fish" is "Andrew L. T"... no. I'll stick to the list provided.
        *   "York Platzer" -> Jörg Platzer. (Not in list but famous Bitcoin person). I will correct "York" to "Jörg" if it sounds like "York". The text says "York Platzer's Bar... Jorg's Bar". The transcript later says "Jorg". I will correct "York Platzer" to "Jörg Platzer" based on context.
        *   "Parallel Nipolis" -> Parallel Polis.
        *   "Lyn Ulbricht" -> Lyn Ulbricht.
        *   "Mike Gagulski" -> Not in list. I'll leave as is.
        *   "Gav" -> Gavin Wood (implied). The list has "Gavin Wood".
        *   "Johnny" -> Probably not in list, maybe a friend.
        *   "James Harrison" -> Not in list.
        *   "Anthony Diorio" -> Anthony Di Iorio.
        *   "Jeff Wilker" -> Jeff Wilcke.
        *   "Cody Wilson" -> Not in list.
        *   "Afri" -> Afri Schoedon.
        *   "Mr. Leagy" -> Maybe "Mikhail Kalinin"? No.
        *   "Girlynet" -> Goerli. "Girly" is a mishearing of "Goerli". I must correct this.
        *   "Girlycon" -> GoerliCon.
        *   "Coti" -> Probably "Mordor"? No, "Coti" is mentioned as an ETC version. There is a "Callisto" (CLO) maybe? But the transcript says "Coti". I'll check the context. "Goerli and Coti". Actually, there was a testnet called "Morden" for ETC. Maybe "Coti" is "Callisto"? Or "Yolo"? Wait, "Coti" is a project, but in this context (ETC version of Goerli), it might be a specific name. I'll keep "Coti" if unsure, or maybe it's "Mordor". But wait, the speaker says "Goerli and Coti". Later "Goerli was the ETC version". Wait, speaker 00 says "Coti was the ETC version". Speaker 01 corrects: "Funding for Girlynet came from the Etc Cooperative." Speaker 00: "There were actually two that were launched that day which was Goerli and Coti. So Coti was the ETC version". Actually, Goerli was a cross-chain testnet (ETH/ETC). But maybe there was an ETC specific one called "Mordor". The transcript says "Coti". I will correct "Girlynet" to "Goerli" for sure. "Coti" might be "Kotti"? There is a testnet "Kotti". "Coti" -> "Kotti". I will use "Kotti" if it fits, or leave as "Coti" if I'm not sure. Actually, looking at the audio "Coti" sounds like "Kotti". But let's stick to the transcript if the list doesn't have it. However, "Girlynet" is definitely "Goerli".
        *   "Department of Centralization" -> Decentralized? No, he says "Department of Centralization". It's likely "Department of Decentralization" (a collective). I will correct if the context suggests. He says "being the emcee... at East Berlin with, with the DoD." and later "Department of Centralization". Given the ethos, "Department of Decentralization" is much more likely. But he says "DoD". "Department of Decentralization" fits DoD better. I will correct to "Department of Decentralization".
        *   "FDEV" -> EF? Or "DFinity"? Or "Parity"? He mentions "Parity offices" right before. Maybe "FDEV" is "EF" (Ethereum Foundation)?
        *   "Kai Gertler" -> Kai (Afri)? No, "Kai Gertler" sounds like a name. List has "Kai". I'll check list. No "Kai". "Kieren" is there. "Kilian" is not. I'll leave "Kai Gertler".
        *   "Giveth" -> Project name.
        *   "Eth. Cat Herders" -> ETH Cat Herders.
        *   "Ed Con" -> Edcon.
        *   "Non Con" -> NonCon.
        *   "Brainbot" -> Brainbot.
        *   "Heiko" -> Heiko Hees? Not in list.
        *   "Jacob" -> Jacob? Maybe "Jesse"? Not sure.
        *   "John Matonis" -> Not in list.
        *   "Swift" -> SWIFT.

7.  **Specific corrections based on list:**
    *   "Mihaly" -> "Mihai Alisie" (Vitalik started Bitcoin Magazine with Mihai).
    *   "Amir Tani" -> "Amir Taaki".
    *   "Anthony Diorio" -> "Anthony Di Iorio".
    *   "Jeff Wilker" -> "Jeff Wilcke" (implied by "Jeff" and Ethereum context).
    *   "Girlynet" -> "Goerli".
    *   "Girlycon" -> "GoerliCon".
    *   "Department of Centralization" -> "Department of Decentralization" (Context: "DoD").
    *   "Exalt server" -> This is very unclear. "Exalt server". Maybe "Executive Director"? Or "Michael Paranti" is a mishearing of "Michael Paranti" (maybe a person not in the list, or "Patrick"?). Actually, looking at the list, there is no "Michael Paranti". There is "Michael", "Parity" (which has Gavin Wood). Wait, maybe "Exalt server" is "Ethereum server"? Or maybe the name is "Michael Perlin"? Not in list. Wait, "Bob Samuel" -> "Bob Summerwill". Who is Michael Paranti? Maybe "Mike Paranti"? Not in list. Maybe "Mike Hearn"? No. Maybe "Michael Paranti" is the correct name of the person being interviewed, just not in the provided list of 244 people. The list is a sample ("Known People (244): ..."), it doesn't claim to be exhaustive. So I should keep the name "Michael Paranti" but fix obvious speech-to-text errors if I recognize them. "Exalt server" might be a title or "exalted server"? I will keep "Exalt server" as a title or just clean it to "Exalt server" (capitalized). Or maybe "Executive Director"? Let's listen to the context: "I'm Bob Samuel here... with my good friend, Exalt server Michael Paranti." It sounds like a title. I'll keep it as "Exalt server" or remove it if it seems like total gibberish, but it's safer to keep proper nouns. Wait, looking at the timestamp 00:03. "Exalt server" might be "Ethereum server"? Or "ex co-founder"? I'll stick to the transcript text unless it's clearly wrong. Let's look at the text: "Exalt server Michael Paranti". Maybe "Michael Paranti" is the name. I will capitalize names.
    *   "Bit coin" -> "Bitcoin".
    *   "etherium" -> "Ethereum".
    *   "daos" -> "DAOs".
    *   "nfts" -> "NFTs".
    *   "Mount Gox" -> "Mt. Gox".
    *   "Magical tux" -> MagicalTux (handle).
    *   "Charlie Schremm" -> Charlie Shrem.
    *   "Ultimate Scripting" -> "Ultimate Scripting".
    *   "Master Coin" -> Mastercoin.
    *   "colored Coin" -> Colored Coins.
    *   "C E N T" -> "CENT".
    *   "mints" -> mint.
    *   "Sent" -> CENT (mentioned later). "Sent" is likely "CENT".
    *   "Jack Dorsey" -> Jack Dorsey.
    *   "WikiLeaks" -> WikiLeaks.
    *   "York Platz" -> Jörg Platz? Or "York Platzer"? "York Platzer's Bar in, in Berlin Room 77". Room 77 is in Berlin. The owner is Jörg von Minckwitz? Or Jörg Platzer? It is Jörg Platzer. "York" is a mishearing of "Jörg". "Jorg's Bar" confirms it. I will change "York Platzer" to "Jörg Platzer".
    *   "Mike Gagulski" -> Not in list, keep.
    *   "freeross.org" -> FreeRoss.org.
    *   "Riot" -> "RIAT" (maybe? Or "Riot"?). Transcript says "Riot R I A T T". So "RIAT".
    *   "Matthias Tarsiewicz" -> Matthias Tarsiewicz.
    *   "Ralph" -> Not in list.
    *   "Johnny" -> Not in list.
    *   "James Harrison" -> Not in list.
    *   "Cody Wilson" -> Not in list.
    *   "Department of Centralization" -> "Department of Decentralization".
    *   "Girlynet" -> "Goerli".
    *   "Girlycon" -> "GoerliCon".
    *   "Etc Cooperative" -> ETC Cooperative.
    *   "Coti" -> Kotti (Testnet name). "Coti" is likely "Kotti" (ETC testnet). I will change "Coti" to "Kotti" or "Callisto" if sure, but "Kotti" is phonetically close and was an ETC testnet. Actually, Kotti was a cross-chain testnet for ETC. I'll use "Kotti".
    *   "DoD" -> DoD (Department of Decentralization).
    *   "Eth Berlin" -> EthBerlin.
    *   "status" -> Status.
    *   "Afri" -> Afri.
    *   "Mr. Leagy" -> "Mr. Leagy"? Maybe "Mikhail"? Not sure. Keep.
    *   "Giveth" -> Giveth.
    *   "Kai Gertler" -> Kai.
    *   "Ed Con" -> Edcon.
    *   "Non Con" -> NonCon.
    *   "Jitsi" -> Jitsi.
    *   "Brainbot" -> Brainbot.
    *   "Trust Line Foundation" -> Trustlines Foundation? The text says "Trust Line Foundation". I'll correct to "Trustlines Foundation" if that's the known entity. "Trust Line Foundation" -> "Trustlines Foundation".
    *   "Heiko" -> Heiko.
    *   "Jacob" -> Jacob.
    *   "John Matonis" -> Jon Matonis? The list doesn't have him. The text says "John Matonis". I will leave it.
    *   "Swift" -> SWIFT.
    *   "NASDAQ" -> Nasdaq.
    *   "Robin Hood" -> Robinhood.

8.  **Filler removal:** Remove excessive "um", "uh", "you know", "like". But keep natural flow.

9.  **Paragraphing:** Merge consecutive speech from same speaker into paragraphs.

10. **Timestamps:** Keep them exactly as provided.

Let's do a pass through the text.

SPEAKER_00: So welcome to early days of Ethereum. I'm Bob Samuel here at Dark Prague with my good friend, Exalt server Michael Paranti. Hello.
Correction: "Bob Samuel" -> "Bob Summerwill" (Based on list). "Dark Prague" -> "Devcon Prague" (Most likely). "Exalt server" -> This is weird. Maybe "Exalted server"? Or "Former"? Let's look at the audio cue. Maybe "Ethereum server"? Or maybe "Michael Perlin"? If I can't be sure, I'll keep "Exalt server" but capitalize properly. Actually, "Exalt server" sounds like a title. I'll keep it but capitalize. Wait, the prompt says "Known People (244)...". Bob Summerwill is there. I will change Bob Samuel to Bob Summerwill. I will change Dark Prague to Devcon Prague. I will capitalize Exalt server. Michael Paranti seems to be the guest's name.

SPEAKER_01: Hey, good to see you again, Bob.

SPEAKER_00: Good to see you too.

SPEAKER_01: So first place, first city we ever met.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: DEFCON 4, man.

SPEAKER_00: Ah, yes, 2018.

SPEAKER_01: First hug that I got from you.

SPEAKER_00: There we are.

SPEAKER_01: You were competing with Grif for being the best.
"Grif" is likely a nickname. Keep.

SPEAKER_00: Right? Well, there we go. There we go. Yeah. So I mean, we've worked together in a number of different contexts since, but today, you know, really wanted to talk to you in terms of, of the early days of Ethereum project and you know, looking back to two beginnings. So I mean, what, what were you doing in the couple of years before any Ethereum involvement?
Filler: "so", "you know". Remove some.
"So welcome to the early days of Ethereum. I'm Bob Summerwill here at Devcon Prague with my good friend, Exalt server Michael Paranti. ... So, I mean, we've worked together in a number of different contexts since. But today, I really wanted to talk to you about the early days of the Ethereum project and looking back to the beginnings. So, what were you doing in the couple of years before any Ethereum involvement?"

SPEAKER_01: Before Ethereum involvement, I was at the Bitcoin foundation, basically.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: So that was my place in the craziness of this space going through. I joined the Bitcoin foundation just months before Mount Gox collapsed.
"Mount Gox" -> "Mt. Gox". "Bitcoin foundation" -> "Bitcoin Foundation".

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that was a fun time.

SPEAKER_01: Right. Mark Capellis was one of the founders, co founders of the Bitcoin Foundation.
"Mark Capellis" -> "Mark Karpelès".

SPEAKER_00: Magical tux.
"Magical tux" -> "MagicalTux".

SPEAKER_01: That was really funny. Yeah. And then Charlie Schremm getting arrested. Right.
"Charlie Schremm" -> "Charlie Shrem".

SPEAKER_00: Two of your directors getting arrested in short order. It's not really fantastic.

SPEAKER_01: So that was an interesting time. And so, I mean, in terms of Ethereum, so you know, Vitalik was on the scene very early as a bitcoiner.
"Vitalik" -> "Vitalik" (Not in list? "Vitalik Buterin" is the name. I should use "Vitalik" or "Vitalik Buterin". List doesn't have "Vitalik". It has "Aaron Davis...". Wait, "Vitalik" is usually referred to by first name. I'll use "Vitalik".)

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And very active in the forum.

SPEAKER_00: So young at the start, eh? 17, I think.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And then Bitcoin magazine started. Right. Together him and Mihaly started that up. And so Vitalik was on my radar just because he was present in the community. You know, there's so few of us at the time. Right. It's like stunning how few people there were at the beginning, you know, and how present a lot of those people still are.
"Mihaly" -> "Mihai Alisie".

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And so I was following, you know, we had blogs before social media. Right?

SPEAKER_00: Right. Long form writing, who'd have thought writing.

SPEAKER_01: And, and so I still had my RSS feeds and Vitalik had a blog, so he was in my RSS feeds and one day he posted something about Ethereum. And so I like, okay, cool.

SPEAKER_00: You know, was, was that first thing, was it the white paper or did he post some posts?

SPEAKER_01: He was talking about the future of digital autonomous corporations.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And daos. Right. And I forget what the exact title of the blog post was that it announced Ethereum.
"daos" -> "DAOs".

SPEAKER_00: I remember there was something that was like Ultimate Scripting. Does that sound familiar? Because I know prior to getting to that sort of baked Ethereum vision, Because he had been doing work within Master Coin, colored Coin, that there was, you know, some of these pre phases of, well, how could you do. How could you do different kind of scripting? And then an uncertainty of where that might land.
"Master Coin" -> "Mastercoin". "colored Coin" -> "Colored Coins". "Ultimate Scripting" -> "Ultimate Scripting" (Title of blog post).

SPEAKER_01: So that. That term doesn't really ring a, you know, ring a bell with me or whatever. But so anyway, so he. He posted about Ethereum for the first time on. On his blog. And I tweeted that out, and so apparently, I'm the first person that ever tw. Tweeted about Ethereum is my claim to fame.
"tw. Tweeted" -> "Tweeted".

SPEAKER_00: Well, that's fantastic. We're gonna have to dig out that tweet, aren't we, and then find the exact date on that. And then maybe the Internet Archive can find the. The blog post.

SPEAKER_01: It's on the original. It's still on. It's on. It's. It's on Twitter. I've.

SPEAKER_00: No, no, I mean in terms of the actual link to the blog itself, I think the.

SPEAKER_01: I think the. The link might still work is still valid.

SPEAKER_00: Okay.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. On. On Vitalik's blog. And funnily, I. When the NFT craze happened, there was this project called Sent, and they, you know, you could turn a tweet into an nft.
"nft" -> "NFT". "Sent" -> "CENT". (Context: "And that's C E N T, right?").

SPEAKER_00: And that's C E N T, right?

SPEAKER_01: Yes, C E N T. And I get this message. I get. I get a DM from somebody, hey, you know, if you mint this as a tweet, I'll, you know, I'll buy it, you know, And I was like, how much you want to buy it for? And he's like, you know, I'll give you 200 bucks. And I was like, for the first tweet of Ethereum? Nah. But I guess I'll mint it, right? You know, and so. So I minted the tweet and ended up. So it's actually the second most expensive tweet behind Jack Dorsey's tweet.

SPEAKER_00: I was gonna say that I remembered because Jack did his first, didn't he? Like the. His very first tweet.

SPEAKER_01: So those two. Those two tweets are the. Are the highest, you know, paid for a tweet.

SPEAKER_00: There you go.

SPEAKER_01: And so I minted it, and some crackhead, like NFT trader in Dubai bought it off me for $21,000. Right.

SPEAKER_00: That's fantastic.

SPEAKER_01: And so the guy that originally messaged me, I gave him 10% of that.

SPEAKER_00: Oh, nice.

SPEAKER_01: And he was in Argentina, and he was a schoolteacher.

SPEAKER_00: Wow.

SPEAKER_01: And he took that 2100 and he turned it into, like, an Educational program for Ethereum in Argentina and like, turned it into a career. And like a year later he wrote me back and he was like, wow, man, that was so cool that you did that. And it meant it's totally changed my life. And like, now I'm teaching about Ethereum and I have school, class of children, and I have all of these things and I'm living from being an Ethereum educator.
"2100" -> "$2,100".

SPEAKER_00: Right, right. Awesome, awesome.

SPEAKER_01: So that was. That was the earliest time about Ethereum.

SPEAKER_00: And So it's probably November 2013, I'd have thought.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly. November 2013. Around that. I think that's exactly when it was. And yeah, so, you know, Vitalik, I saw at various meetups when he, you know, I think there was a yellow paper first. Right? First there was a. Yeah, so the.

SPEAKER_00: Well, so, yeah, so the white paper that, that was November, like, like you say, I guess there's some prior blogs before. Right. Here's a fully formed white paper which then he sent out to some random group of people and they passed it on to further people. And that was sort of like how the beginning of that, people getting together to start doing that happened.

SPEAKER_01: So I have like another sort of like, interconnection that the first time I ever spent bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought Whiskey for Smari McCarthy and Asta Fish, who were two of the parliamentarians in Iceland from the Pirate Party.
"bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin". "Bitcoin Foundation" -> "Bitcoin Foundation". "Smari McCarthy" -> "Smari McCarthy". "Asta Fish" -> This is likely a mishearing. Who is Asta Fish? Maybe "Birgitta Jónsdóttir"? The Pirate Party member. "Asta Fish" doesn't sound like Birgitta. Maybe "Ásta"? Ásta Guðrún Helgadóttir? She is an Icelandic Pirate Party MP. "Asta Fish" could be "Ásta and...". Or maybe "Astafis"? I'll check "Asta Fish". The transcript says "Smari McCarthy and Asta Fish". It's plausible it's "Smari McCarthy and [Someone]". Or maybe "Smari McCarthy and ...". I will keep "Asta Fish" if I can't be sure, but "Ásta" is likely correct. Actually, "Asta Fish" -> "Astaphis"? No. I'll keep "Asta Fish" to be safe, as I shouldn't guess outside the list. Wait, later he mentions "Smari McCarthy, you know, was one of the early WikiLeaks guys." Smari McCarthy is correct. I'll leave "Asta Fish".

SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And Smari McCarthy, you know, was one of the early WikiLeaks guys.

SPEAKER_00: Right, okay.

SPEAKER_01: And they, they were sitting in York Platzer's Bar in, in Berlin Room 77, which is where the. All the. The earliest bitcoin meetups were happening.
"York Platzer" -> "Jörg Platzer". "Berlin Room 77" -> "Room 77" in Berlin. "bitcoin meetups" -> "Bitcoin meetups".

SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay.

SPEAKER_01: And also was the first place that you could buy alcohol and with. With.

SPEAKER_00: With crypto. Right. With bitcoin.
"crypto" -> "crypto". "bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin".

SPEAKER_01: And so Smari had tweeted that he was going. Going to Jorg's Bar. And I was like, okay, cool, I've definitely gotta buy you a whiskey. So, like, we did this over Twitter and I, and I, you know, I published the transaction, you know, on Twitter.
"Jorg's Bar" -> "Jörg's Bar". "Twitter" -> "Twitter".

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: To see that it was confirmed. And I, you know, bought them whiskey in York Platz's Bar. And so York Platzer is one of the original members here of Parallel Nipolis. Right?
"York Platz's Bar" -> "Jörg Platzer's Bar". "Parallel Nipolis" -> "Parallel Polis".

SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: The role that I have here now of kind of being the one that packs it all together and gives like a vibe of, you know, where we're at in the space or where we're at in the house was what Jorg used to do. Right, Right here. And so, yeah, there's like an interesting connection. And so room 77 is actually where it is that Vitalik and Gavin decided to literally. To actually do Ethereum.
"Gavin" -> "Gavin Wood" (implied). "Ethereum" -> "Ethereum". "Jorg" -> "Jörg".

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: Gavin was introduced to Vitalik by Amir Tani, who's also here in the house. And so, like, this house is really, like, interconnected for me with all of these people, this social nexus. Yeah, yeah, Because Mike Gagulski, who was my partner in Bitcoiners Without Borders, who was the PHP programmer who wrote the module for all of the membership donations to the bitcoin foundation, was an original member of this house and he's the one who introduced me to Amir Taki and also the one who introduced me to Lyn Ulbricht.
"Gavin" -> "Gavin Wood". "Amir Tani" -> "Amir Taaki". "Mike Gagulski" -> Keep. "Bitcoiners Without Borders" -> Keep. "bitcoin foundation" -> "Bitcoin Foundation". "Amir Taki" -> "Amir Taaki". "Lyn Ulbricht" -> "Lyn Ulbricht".

SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And he's the guy that started freeross.org.
"freeross.org" -> "FreeRoss.org".

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: So we're really far away from Ethereum history, but it's kind of. To talk about Ethereum in the early days, you have to talk about Bitcoin.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: Because it was an ICO on. It was an ICO on Bitcoin. Right.
"ICO" -> "ICO". "Bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin".

SPEAKER_00: And you were not so far away from Berlin all of these years. I mean, did you meet some of these people in Berlin? Was that primarily these people were coming.

SPEAKER_01: Through Vienna as well. So we had two spaces in Vienna. We have Metalab, which is the second earliest hacker space after CCC in Europe. So there was Noise Bridge in San Francisco and CCC and Metalab. So that's where early meetups happened in Bitcoin. But the earliest Ethereum meetups were at Riot R I A T T at Matthias Tarsiewicz and Ralph, and they hosted the first Ethereum meetups, which is the first time that I met Vitalik personally. Was that right? Was that Riot?
"Metalab" -> "Metalab". "CCC" -> "CCC". "Noise Bridge" -> "Noisebridge". "Riot R I A T T" -> "RIAT". "Matthias Tarsiewicz" -> "Matthias Tarsiewicz". "Ralph" -> "Ralph". "Vitalik" -> "Vitalik".

SPEAKER_00: Right, There you go. Yeah. But yeah, you'd mentioned the yellow paper, so that the timeline on that is both Gav and Jeff Wilker started their Ethereum stuff within days of each other, just after Christmas. So, you know, like. Or just before, actually. So Gav's first commit was December 23, 2013. And I think Jeff's. Was it like a couple of days later?
"Gav" -> "Gavin Wood". "Jeff Wilker" -> "Jeff Wilcke". "Ethereum" -> "Ethereum".

SPEAKER_01: 2013, man.

SPEAKER_00: Well, so it was basically like a thing to do over the Christmas holidays, I think, for both of them.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. If you look at the email. Right. Or the about me.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Message that you have.

SPEAKER_00: You know. That's right. Yeah. So. So Gav said, you know, hey, Johnny gave me the heads up about Ethereum. So that was. I mean. Oh, goodness, I forget his name now. James Harrison. Anyway, he was one of the guys in London. So with, with Amir. So you know, Gav had met Johnny through Amir and Johnny had told him about Ethereum and then he contacted Vitalik. Yeah, but then, yeah, they got going there.
"Gav" -> "Gavin Wood". "Ethereum" -> "Ethereum". "James Harrison" -> "James Harrison". "Amir" -> "Amir Taaki". "Johnny" -> "Johnny". "Vitalik" -> "Vitalik".

SPEAKER_01: Then there was a Cody Wilson was. It was there as well.
"Cody Wilson" -> "Cody Wilson".

SPEAKER_00: Right, right, yep. Cody, Cody in there.

SPEAKER_01: And I saw the shot of video.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, video of Cody in Canada. So. Yeah. So January of 2014, you had the Bitcoin Miami where Ethereum first got announced, and then they had the house that Anthony Diorio had rented where they all sort of met physically for the first time. Well, not everyone, but many, many people.
"Bitcoin Miami" -> "Bitcoin Miami". "Ethereum" -> "Ethereum". "Anthony Diorio" -> "Anthony Di Iorio".

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So these were things that were all tangentially on my online presence.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right, right.

SPEAKER_01: I mean, you know, you talk about crypto, Twitter and it's truly really the place where, you know, all these, these social groups intersected. You knew what people were doing, people were posting about what's. What's going on. So then you asked me about Ben.
"crypto, Twitter" -> "Crypto Twitter".

SPEAKER_00: But then, sorry, so. So yeah, it was by April they have this bitcoin expo in Toronto, but that was also when the yellow paper had been done. So Gavin spent those four months basically building the first working client and doing the yellow paper spec. Yeah, yeah, But Berlin you were saying.
"bitcoin expo" -> "Bitcoin Expo". "Gavin" -> "Gavin Wood".

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so, so. And you know, so Berlin here in Europe was, you know, the, basically the city. You know, so there's Prague for the crypto anarchists. Right. But Berlin is really was the city for Ethereum. Right. And so I was involved with the Department of Centralization. Right. So also doing what it is I do here as an emcee on stage at, at East Berlin with, with the DoD. And then also we did the launch of Girlynet. Right.
"Berlin" -> "Berlin". "Prague" -> "Prague". "crypto anarchists" -> "crypto-anarchists". "Ethereum" -> "Ethereum". "Department of Centralization" -> "Department of Decentralization". "Girlynet" -> "Goerli". "East Berlin" -> Maybe "EthBerlin"? "East Berlin" is a place, but "EthBerlin" is a conference. He says "on stage at, at East Berlin". Might be "EthBerlin". Later he says "Eth Berlin". I'll change "East Berlin" to "EthBerlin" here as it makes sense in context.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: So they're also in, In Berlin was a DOD production.

SPEAKER_00: Do you know where the funding for that came from?

SPEAKER_01: It was just.

SPEAKER_00: There was no funding for Girly.
"Girly" -> "Goerli".

SPEAKER_01: There was no funding for Girly. They just did it Afri and Mr. Leagy, you know, and yeah, it was like two or three people that, you know, that deployed Girlynet, you know, so.
"Girly" -> "Goerli". "Afri" -> "Afri". "Mr. Leagy" -> "Mr. Leagy" (Keep). "Girlynet" -> "Goerli".

SPEAKER_00: I can tell you the answer is actually from the Etc Cooperative.
"Etc Cooperative" -> "ETC Cooperative".

SPEAKER_01: Funding for Girlynet came from the Etc Cooperative.
"Girlynet" -> "Goerli". "Etc Cooperative" -> "ETC Cooperative".

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, So it was supposedly a collaboration between the Etc Cooperative and the Ethereum foundation. But then the foundation didn't come through with the money. I think they did later. But yes, that's how that happened.
"Ethereum foundation" -> "Ethereum Foundation".

SPEAKER_01: So I was there as. So we hosted the conference there. Girlycon. There's. In my, in my YouTube playlist, there's the Girlycon, you know, hosting video and then also when we deployed it, like pressing the button, watching the screen. Yeah, it's all live because there were.
"Girlycon" -> "GoerliCon".

SPEAKER_00: Actually two that were launched that day which was Goerli and Coti. So Coti was the ETC version, but yeah, that was funded by the ETC Cooperative.
"Goerli" -> "Goerli". "Coti" -> "Kotti". (Kotti was an ETC testnet).

SPEAKER_01: That's fucking hilarious. Right? Yeah. So Berlin is a major place in Europe because I can't travel off the continent. Right, Right. So. So I was never able to go to London and you know, me and London or go to Ethanver or anything like that. Yeah. So. So I got active in Ethereum. The reason I got active in Ethereum was after the block size wars.
"Berlin" -> "Berlin". "Ethereum" -> "Ethereum". "Ethanver" -> "Edcon"? Or "Etherverse"? Maybe "EdCon" or "DevCon". "Ethanver" sounds like a mishearing of "EtherCamp"? Or "DevCon"? "Go to DevCon"? He later says "Edcon". Maybe "Ethanver" is "EtherCamp". Or "DevCon". Let's keep "Ethanver" if unsure, but it's likely "DevCon". "block size wars" -> "Block Size Wars".

SPEAKER_00: Right, Right.

SPEAKER_01: And I mean Bitcoin was just so toxic. Right. And.
"Bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin".

SPEAKER_00: And just thinking nothing's ever going to happen here.

SPEAKER_01: This is like traumatized, whatever. And then there was just all of this bright eyed, bushy tailed, idealistic, you know, unicorns and glitter, you know.

SPEAKER_00: Yes.

SPEAKER_01: And I'm an old hippie. Right. And it just was like natural. It was like, you know, flame, you know, to be involved with it there.

SPEAKER_00: Quite a different vibe.

SPEAKER_01: And so. So Eth Berlin was a very, very cool thing at that time. And. And at that time I was working with status.
"Eth Berlin" -> "EthBerlin". "status" -> "Status".

SPEAKER_00: Right, right, right.

SPEAKER_01: I was the resident cypherpunk at. At Status.

SPEAKER_00: Were many of those in.

SPEAKER_01: What do you mean?

SPEAKER_00: So like on Status, where were people working on status based generally or all over the place?
"Status" -> "Status".

SPEAKER_01: There was obviously a Berlin entity, you know, so Carl, one of the co founders. So obviously, you know, they were doing the jurisdictional arbitrage between a foundation for management of their token and then where it is. But Berlin was the entity where a lot of people were paid out of and then they have, you know, a Singapore entity, I believe and stuff. But we were distributed.
"Carl" -> "Carl" (Carl Bennetts or Carl? List has "Carl Lerche" - no. Status co-founders: Carl Bennetts, Jarrad Hope. I will use "Carl" as is).

SPEAKER_00: Right, Right.

SPEAKER_01: We were distributed, you know, 247 status. And so that was, that was really cool. So that's. So with, with. With each Status and, and Department of Centralization was my. Was my primary involvement.
"Status" -> "Status". "Department of Centralization" -> "Department of Decentralization".

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: By being in Berlin. You know, you're involved with Gnosis. Right. And. And what was the. The video streaming portal anyway? They were another huge 2017 ICO that was based in Berlin because we had full node there.
"Berlin" -> "Berlin". "Gnosis" -> "Gnosis". "ICO" -> "ICO". "full node" -> "full node".

SPEAKER_00: Right?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Did you ever spend time visiting or within the FDEV or Parity offices?
"FDEV" -> "EF"? "Parity" -> "Parity".

SPEAKER_01: So I never were in either, either of the offices, but I know numerous people. So Kai Gertler, who's the system administrator for Giveth and a lot of other things was like in Eth. Cat Herders.
"Giveth" -> "Giveth". "Eth. Cat Herders" -> "ETH Cat Herders". "Kai Gertler" -> Keep.

SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And stuff like that. Why did I want to mention Kai. So he and I put together when Covid hit.
"Covid" -> "COVID".

SPEAKER_00: Right?

SPEAKER_01: Okay. Ed Con was supposed to be in Vienna, right. And so that was all that was in 2019. And that was the year that I decided to open a parallel polis in Vienna.
"Ed Con" -> "Edcon". "parallel polis" -> "Parallel Polis".

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And I thought, okay, I'll do the launch during Ed Con.
"Ed Con" -> "Edcon".

SPEAKER_00: Okay.

SPEAKER_01: And I've got all the Ethereum people, you know, here, and then I'll do a side event to announce the launch of Parallel Nippolis. Right, right. And then it was like, no, Chinese people can't come to Vienna. Right, right. That's. They're like, okay, but we're still do edcon. Right. And then the full shutdown came, but everybody had their tickets booked to. To edcon in Vienna. Right. And so I was like, well, fuck it, I'm going to do. I'm going to do. This is before the total shutdown, like, okay, I'm going to do Non Con.
"Ethereum" -> "Ethereum". "Parallel Nippolis" -> "Parallel Polis". "edcon" -> "Edcon". "Non Con" -> "NonCon".

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And so I booked a venue and. And then came the full shutdown. And so I did a virtual conference. It was three days with four tracks with I think 80 speakers. And Kai and I wrote a program called Inner Space. And Inner Space was an integrated online convention portal which had integrated Google Calendar and Jitsi video conferencing and integration with Discord and Telegram. Right. So that you had all of the, all of that in one portal.
"Kai" -> "Kai". "Inner Space" -> "Inner Space". "Google Calendar" -> "Google Calendar". "Jitsi" -> "Jitsi". "Discord" -> "Discord". "Telegram" -> "Telegram".

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And we launched that with Noncon. Okay. And so that's all online, right? Non Con onto the parallel Nepalis Vienna site. Yeah. So that was, you know, it's just sort of like. Was obvious for me. Like I'm. I'm interested in people who are, who are building. Right. And you know, I'm a true cypherpunk in that sense. You know, deploy the code, show me, do what is you're doing. And I've just been on the convention side and that was. So my, this is where my involvement has been in Ethereum, that and. And community building. Right. And so through that I got to meet pretty much, you know, like everybody, you know, but Gavin Wood was the last one that I actually met personally.
"Noncon" -> "NonCon". "parallel Nepalis" -> "Parallel Polis". "Ethereum" -> "Ethereum". "Gavin Wood" -> "Gavin Wood".

SPEAKER_00: Oh, right.

SPEAKER_01: For the first time here in May. Came to Pizza day. And so he's speaking here today.

SPEAKER_00: He is speaking in 40 minutes.

SPEAKER_01: In 40 minutes. Right. So yeah, so tangentially, you know, get to meet a lot of the people. I also worked at Brainbot for the Trust Line Foundation.
"Brainbot" -> "Brainbot". "Trust Line Foundation" -> "Trustlines Foundation" (Likely, as Brainbot created Trustlines).

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: With. With Heiko. Yeah, he's and you know, another early person and that's. Yeah, Jacob was there and Right. Left us right yeah, yeah. You know, so. But these, these core people, it's, it's. Yeah, yeah. It's so interesting. This whole thing for me is really wild because I never really came. Although there's an ideological underpinning and a natural, you know, do it yourself ethic that comes out of the punk or the hippie, you know, roots it is that I have out of California, where it is that we built the Internet, whatever. And I've always just been around, interested in the people and the, you know, the sympathetic people and the doers.
"Heiko" -> "Heiko". "Jacob" -> "Jacob". "Internet" -> "internet".

SPEAKER_00: Right, Yep.

SPEAKER_01: And they're not necessarily the public faces that you see and everybody knows or that are allowed in the space, you know, because that's a different part. I've just been like, around the devs, you know.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: The silent, you know, the silent underpinning, the silent foundation of what actually happens in the space.

SPEAKER_00: Right. Has Ethereum become what you thought it might be? How much of a. The vision of what could happen there do you think has actually happened?
"Ethereum" -> "Ethereum".

SPEAKER_01: So I had two viewpoints, I think that are common to early bitcoiners. Right. Anything that can be built on another chain can eventually be deployed on Bitcoin, Right?
"bitcoiners" -> "Bitcoiners". "Bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin".

SPEAKER_00: Yep. And very common early belief.

SPEAKER_01: And. And so there's this also this sort of like move fast, break things, you know, sort of culture of Ethereum, which I really liked. And I was always a. And I always thought, yeah, cool. I'm really happy that all this stuff is happening on Ethereum like a sandbox.
"Ethereum" -> "Ethereum".

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And not happening on Bitcoin. Right.
"Bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin".

SPEAKER_00: Yep, yep.

SPEAKER_01: So. So I mean, look at the, look at the ecosystem, you know, I think that one of the coolest things that Ethereum enabled was crowdfunding. Right? Yeah, Just this completely alternative economy that created stocks, shareholders, you know what I mean? And it's in a completely new form. That just was so direct.
"Ethereum" -> "Ethereum".

SPEAKER_00: Yes, right. Yep.

SPEAKER_01: It's like amazing. The whole world should literally work like that. And I. So I love that aspect of Ethereum is that they. Is that they just did it.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: That literally we issued. Created companies, created. Oh, there's no jurisdiction where we can register and do our stuff. It. We're going to build daos.
"daos" -> "DAOs".

SPEAKER_00: Yep.

SPEAKER_01: You know what I mean? And. And so. So all of this fabulous, permissionless stuff has happened on Ethereum that could not culturally happen on Bitcoin and may not ever actually happen on Bitcoin with the way that it's becoming part of the traditional finance.
"Ethereum" -> "Ethereum". "Bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin".

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: So another thing that I think is really interesting is seeing the. Is seeing what's going on now with actually Enterprise Ethereum.
"Enterprise Ethereum" -> "Enterprise Ethereum".

SPEAKER_00: And you were at the EA at.

SPEAKER_01: The beginning, which was super logical for me. Right. Y. But it was too early because there wasn't really any clients. You were just doing educational work.

SPEAKER_00: Pilots.

SPEAKER_01: Pilots and whatever. But now we're actually there. So, I mean, you know, the promise of Ethereum, I think is well, well, well exceeded its initial sort of, you know.
"Ethereum" -> "Ethereum".

SPEAKER_00: No, I mean, it is kind of mind blowing to see, you know, these huge, you know, financial companies, you know, saying, yep, you know, we're. We're building an L2 or we're building a, you know, an EVM one. Yep. So, you know, so literally the way.
"L2" -> "L2". "EVM" -> "EVM".

SPEAKER_01: That I got my first paid job at the Bitcoin Foundation.
"Bitcoin Foundation" -> "Bitcoin Foundation".

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Was John Matonis, who was the director of the Bitcoin foundation, went to. Came to Vienna to talk to bankers and diplomats.
"John Matonis" -> "Jon Matonis" (Probably, but transcript says John. I'll keep "John Matonis" unless I'm sure. Jon is the correct spelling for the former Bitcoin Foundation director. I will correct to "Jon Matonis"). "Bitcoin foundation" -> "Bitcoin Foundation".

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: He's like, oh, Michael, so. And I just knew him from Twitter.

SPEAKER_00: Yep.

SPEAKER_01: And he's like, oh, I'm going to be in town. Right. Let's have a coffee. Right. And at that coffee, he said, hey, we listen, we need new branding and a new website for the Bitcoin Foundation. Do you think you can do that? Because there's a vote coming up and it's going to change and we're going to be do. And I agreed to do that. Right. But when he left Vienna, he went to Swift.
"Bitcoin Foundation" -> "Bitcoin Foundation". "Swift" -> "SWIFT".

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: This is 2013.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right, right.

SPEAKER_01: So is Swift doing anything on bitcoin? No. Why is it not doing anything on Bitcoin? Because bitcoiners were too dumb to. To just go ahead and do it back then when add the scripting and composability and everything onto Bitcoin. And the way it is that all the L2s are now doing, all the L2s are a form of Ethereum. Right. So, you know, it's, it's quite wild, quite wild to see. And it's a, you know, huge circle for me just to see that announcement from Swift that they're doing an L2, you know.
"Swift" -> "SWIFT". "bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin". "bitcoiners" -> "Bitcoiners". "Bitcoin" -> "Bitcoin". "L2s" -> "L2s". "Ethereum" -> "Ethereum".

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. So Swift. Then you've got Stripe, you know, with Tempo, Stripe and Friends. Kind of looks like a bit of a Libra again, but, you know, same, same kind of tech base. And then NASDAQ announced Robin Hood, you had as well.
"Swift" -> "SWIFT". "Stripe" -> "Stripe". "Tempo" -> "Tempo". "Libra" -> "Libra". "NASDAQ" -> "Nasdaq". "Robin Hood" -> "Robinhood".

SPEAKER_01: So, I mean, I always, I always figure that it doesn't really matter where the chains are, who owns them and who controls them, whether they're, you know, degree of centralized or decentralized and whatever, because there's always going to be a bridge. And if there's not a bridge, there's going to be a tokenized representation of it to trade on it. So this sort of idea of a borderless economy, if the cat's out of the bag and everybody is catching up and it's going to be interesting to see where it is that we're at in 10 years. I think that bitcoiners and Ethereums are going to be incredibly disappointed. But that's what happens when you percolate the tech into the world. You don't know what's actually going to be the end game. But the fact of the matter is, is that the tech revolution has happened.
"bitcoiners" -> "Bitcoiners". "Ethereums" -> "Ethereans".

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

SPEAKER_01: Most certainly.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, thanks so much. Great chatting to you. Great catching up with you as always. And all the very best.

SPEAKER_01: I'll get you some archives for your. For your site.

SPEAKER_00: Excellent. Yeah. Do pictures find goodies? You know, we love digital artifacts. You know, photos, links, you know, find that first tweet, memories. I want to record everything I can.

SPEAKER_01: And thank you so much, man, for being present in my life professionally and personally and in this amazing space, man. You're one of the top people in the space for me, man.

SPEAKER_00: Well, thanks so much. All the very best. Bye.

Let's go.SPEAKER_00: So welcome to Early Days of Ethereum. I'm Bob Summerwill here at Devcon Prague with my good friend, Exalt server Michael Paranti. Hello.

SPEAKER_01: Hey, good to see you again, Bob.

SPEAKER_00: Good to see you too.

SPEAKER_01: So first place, first city we ever met.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: DEFCON 4, man.

SPEAKER_00: Ah, yes, 2018.

SPEAKER_01: First hug that I got from you.

SPEAKER_00: There we are.

SPEAKER_01: You were competing with Grif for being the best.

SPEAKER_00: Right? Well, there we go. There we go. Yeah. So I mean, we've worked together in a number of different contexts since, but today, really wanted to talk to you in terms of the early days of the Ethereum project and looking back to the beginnings. So, what were you doing in the couple of years before any Ethereum involvement?

SPEAKER_01: Before Ethereum involvement, I was at the Bitcoin Foundation, basically.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: So that was my place in the craziness of this space going through. I joined the Bitcoin Foundation just months before Mt. Gox collapsed.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that was a fun time.

SPEAKER_01: Right. Mark Karpelès was one of the co-founders of the Bitcoin Foundation.

SPEAKER_00: MagicalTux.

SPEAKER_01: That was really funny. Yeah. And then Charlie Shrem getting arrested. Right.

SPEAKER_00: Two of your directors getting arrested in short order. It's not really fantastic.

SPEAKER_01: So that was an interesting time. And so, I mean, in terms of Ethereum, so you know, Vitalik was on the scene very early as a Bitcoiner.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And very active in the forum.

SPEAKER_00: So young at the start, eh? 17, I think.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And then Bitcoin Magazine started. Right. Together him and Mihai Alisie started that up. And so Vitalik was on my radar just because he was present in the community. You know, there's so few of us at the time. Right. It's like stunning how few people there were at the beginning, you know, and how present a lot of those people still are.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And so I was following, you know, we had blogs before social media. Right?

SPEAKER_00: Right. Long form writing, who'd have thought writing.

SPEAKER_01: And, so I still had my RSS feeds and Vitalik had a blog, so he was in my RSS feeds and one day he posted something about Ethereum. And so I was like, okay, cool.

SPEAKER_00: You know, was that first thing, was it the white paper or did he post some posts?

SPEAKER_01: He was talking about the future of digital autonomous corporations.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And DAOs. Right. And I forget what the exact title of the blog post was that announced Ethereum.

SPEAKER_00: I remember there was something that was like Ultimate Scripting. Does that sound familiar? Because I know prior to getting to that sort of baked Ethereum vision, because he had been doing work within Mastercoin, Colored Coins, that there was, you know, some of these pre phases of, well, how could you do different kind of scripting? And then an uncertainty of where that might land.

SPEAKER_01: So that term doesn't really ring a bell with me or whatever. But so anyway, so he posted about Ethereum for the first time on his blog. And I tweeted that out, and so apparently, I'm the first person that ever tweeted about Ethereum is my claim to fame.

SPEAKER_00: Well, that's fantastic. We're gonna have to dig out that tweet, aren't we, and then find the exact date on that. And then maybe the Internet Archive can find the blog post.

SPEAKER_01: It's on the original. It's still on Twitter. I've.

SPEAKER_00: No, no, I mean in terms of the actual link to the blog itself, I think the.

SPEAKER_01: I think the link might still work is still valid.

SPEAKER_00: Okay.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. On Vitalik's blog. And funnily, when the NFT craze happened, there was this project called CENT, and they, you know, you could turn a tweet into an NFT.

SPEAKER_00: And that's CENT, right?

SPEAKER_01: Yes, CENT. And I get this message. I get a DM from somebody, hey, you know, if you mint this as a tweet, I'll buy it, you know. And I was like, how much you want to buy it for? And he's like, you know, I'll give you 200 bucks. And I was like, for the first tweet of Ethereum? Nah. But I guess I'll mint it, right? You know, and so I minted the tweet and ended up. So it's actually the second most expensive tweet behind Jack Dorsey's tweet.

SPEAKER_00: I was gonna say that I remembered because Jack did his first, didn't he? Like his very first tweet.

SPEAKER_01: So those two tweets are the highest paid for a tweet.

SPEAKER_00: There you go.

SPEAKER_01: And so I minted it, and some crackhead, like NFT trader in Dubai bought it off me for $21,000. Right.

SPEAKER_00: That's fantastic.

SPEAKER_01: And so the guy that originally messaged me, I gave him 10% of that.

SPEAKER_00: Oh, nice.

SPEAKER_01: And he was in Argentina, and he was a schoolteacher.

SPEAKER_00: Wow.

SPEAKER_01: And he took that $2,100 and he turned it into, like, an educational program for Ethereum in Argentina and like, turned it into a career. And like a year later he wrote me back and he was like, wow, man, that was so cool that you did that. And it meant it's totally changed my life. And like, now I'm teaching about Ethereum and I have school, class of children, and I have all of these things and I'm living from being an Ethereum educator.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right. Awesome, awesome.

SPEAKER_01: So that was the earliest time about Ethereum.

SPEAKER_00: And so it's probably November 2013, I'd have thought.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly. November 2013. Around that. I think that's exactly when it was. And yeah, so, you know, Vitalik, I saw at various meetups when he, you know, I think there was a yellow paper first. Right? First there was a. Yeah, so the.

SPEAKER_00: Well, so, yeah, so the white paper that was November, like you say, I guess there's some prior blogs before. Right. Here's a fully formed white paper which then he sent out to some random group of people and they passed it on to further people. And that was sort of like how the beginning of that, people getting together to start doing that happened.

SPEAKER_01: So I have like another sort of interconnection that the first time I ever spent Bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought whiskey for Smari McCarthy and Asta Fish, who were two of the parliamentarians in Iceland from the Pirate Party.

SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And Smari McCarthy, you know, was one of the early WikiLeaks guys.

SPEAKER_00: Right, okay.

SPEAKER_01: And they were sitting in Jörg Platzer's Bar in, in Berlin Room 77, which is where all the earliest Bitcoin meetups were happening.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay.

SPEAKER_01: And also was the first place that you could buy alcohol and with.

SPEAKER_00: With crypto. Right. With Bitcoin.

SPEAKER_01: And so Smari had tweeted that he was going to Jörg's Bar. And I was like, okay, cool, I've definitely gotta buy you a whiskey. So, like, we did this over Twitter and I, you know, I published the transaction, you know, on Twitter.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: To see that it was confirmed. And I, you know, bought them whiskey in Jörg Platzer's Bar. And so Jörg Platzer is one of the original members here of Parallel Polis. Right?

SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: The role that I have here now of kind of being the one that packs it all together and gives like a vibe of, you know, where we're at in the space or where we're at in the house was what Jörg used to do. Right, right here. And so, yeah, there's like an interesting connection. And so Room 77 is actually where it is that Vitalik and Gavin decided to literally to actually do Ethereum.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: Gavin was introduced to Vitalik by Amir Taaki, who's also here in the house. And so, like, this house is really, like, interconnected for me with all of these people, this social nexus. Yeah, yeah, because Mike Gagulski, who was my partner in Bitcoiners Without Borders, who was the PHP programmer who wrote the module for all of the membership donations to the Bitcoin Foundation, was an original member of this house and he's the one who introduced me to Amir Taaki and also the one who introduced me to Lyn Ulbricht.

SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And he's the guy that started FreeRoss.org.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: So we're really far away from Ethereum history, but it's kind of. To talk about Ethereum in the early days, you have to talk about Bitcoin.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: Because it was an ICO on. It was an ICO on Bitcoin. Right.

SPEAKER_00: And you were not so far away from Berlin all of these years. I mean, did you meet some of these people in Berlin? Was that primarily these people were coming.

SPEAKER_01: Through Vienna as well. So we had two spaces in Vienna. We have Metalab, which is the second earliest hacker space after CCC in Europe. So there was Noisebridge in San Francisco and CCC and Metalab. So that's where early meetups happened in Bitcoin. But the earliest Ethereum meetups were at RIAT at Matthias Tarsiewicz and Ralph, and they hosted the first Ethereum meetups, which is the first time that I met Vitalik personally. Was that right? Was that RIAT?

SPEAKER_00: Right, there you go. Yeah. But yeah, you'd mentioned the yellow paper, so that the timeline on that is both Gav and Jeff Wilcke started their Ethereum stuff within days of each other, just after Christmas. So, you know, like. Or just before, actually. So Gav's first commit was December 23, 2013. And I think Jeff's. Was it like a couple of days later?

SPEAKER_01: 2013, man.

SPEAKER_00: Well, so it was basically like a thing to do over the Christmas holidays, I think, for both of them.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. If you look at the email. Right. Or the about me.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Message that you have.

SPEAKER_00: You know. That's right. Yeah. So. So Gav said, you know, hey, Johnny gave me the heads up about Ethereum. So that was. I mean. Oh, goodness, I forget his name now. James Harrison. Anyway, he was one of the guys in London. So with, with Amir. So you know, Gav had met Johnny through Amir and Johnny had told him about Ethereum and then he contacted Vitalik. Yeah, but then, yeah, they got going there.

SPEAKER_01: Then there was a Cody Wilson was. It was there as well.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right, yep. Cody, Cody in there.

SPEAKER_01: And I saw the shot of video.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, video of Cody in Canada. So. Yeah. So January of 2014, you had the Bitcoin Miami where Ethereum first got announced, and then they had the house that Anthony Di Iorio had rented where they all sort of met physically for the first time. Well, not everyone, but many, many people.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So these were things that were all tangentially on my online presence.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right, right.

SPEAKER_01: I mean, you know, you talk about Crypto Twitter and it's truly really the place where, you know, all these, these social groups intersected. You knew what people were doing, people were posting about what's going on. So then you asked me about Ben.

SPEAKER_00: But then, sorry, so. So yeah, it was by April they have this Bitcoin Expo in Toronto, but that was also when the yellow paper had been done. So Gavin spent those four months basically building the first working client and doing the yellow paper spec. Yeah, yeah, But Berlin you were saying.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so, so. And you know, so Berlin here in Europe was, you know, the, basically the city. You know, so there's Prague for the crypto-anarchists. Right. But Berlin is really was the city for Ethereum. Right. And so I was involved with the Department of Decentralization. Right. So also doing what it is I do here as an emcee on stage at, at EthBerlin with, with the DoD. And then also we did the launch of Goerli. Right.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: So they're also in, in Berlin was a DoD production.

SPEAKER_00: Do you know where the funding for that came from?

SPEAKER_01: It was just.

SPEAKER_00: There was no funding for Goerli.

SPEAKER_01: There was no funding for Goerli. They just did it Afri and Mr. Leagy, you know, and yeah, it was like two or three people that, you know, that deployed Goerli, you know, so.

SPEAKER_00: I can tell you the answer is actually from the ETC Cooperative.

SPEAKER_01: Funding for Goerli came from the ETC Cooperative.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, So it was supposedly a collaboration between the ETC Cooperative and the Ethereum Foundation. But then the Foundation didn't come through with the money. I think they did later. But yes, that's how that happened.

SPEAKER_01: So I was there as. So we hosted the conference there. GoerliCon. There's. In my, in my YouTube playlist, there's the GoerliCon, you know, hosting video and then also when we deployed it, like pressing the button, watching the screen. Yeah, it's all live because there were.

SPEAKER_00: Actually two that were launched that day which was Goerli and Kotti. So Kotti was the ETC version, but yeah, that was funded by the ETC Cooperative.

SPEAKER_01: That's fucking hilarious. Right? Yeah. So Berlin is a major place in Europe because I can't travel off the continent. Right, right. So. So I was never able to go to London and you know, me and London or go to Ethanver or anything like that. Yeah. So. So I got active in Ethereum. The reason I got active in Ethereum was after the Block Size Wars.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: And I mean Bitcoin was just so toxic. Right. And.

SPEAKER_00: And just thinking nothing's ever going to happen here.

SPEAKER_01: This is like traumatized, whatever. And then there was just all of this bright eyed, bushy tailed, idealistic, you know, unicorns and glitter, you know.

SPEAKER_00: Yes.

SPEAKER_01: And I'm an old hippie. Right. And it just was like natural. It was like, you know, flame, you know, to be involved with it there.

SPEAKER_00: Quite a different vibe.

SPEAKER_01: And so. So EthBerlin was a very, very cool thing at that time. And. And at that time I was working with Status.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right, right.

SPEAKER_01: I was the resident cypherpunk at Status.

SPEAKER_00: Were many of those in.

SPEAKER_01: What do you mean?

SPEAKER_00: So like on Status, where were people working on Status based generally or all over the place?

SPEAKER_01: There was obviously a Berlin entity, you know, so Carl, one of the co-founders. So obviously, you know, they were doing the jurisdictional arbitrage between a foundation for management of their token and then where it is. But Berlin was the entity where a lot of people were paid out of and then they have, you know, a Singapore entity, I believe and stuff. But we were distributed.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: We were distributed, you know, 24/7 Status. And so that was, that was really cool. So that's. So with, with. With each Status and, and Department of Decentralization was my. Was my primary involvement.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: By being in Berlin. You know, you're involved with Gnosis. Right. And. And what was the. The video streaming portal anyway? They were another huge 2017 ICO that was based in Berlin because we had full node there.

SPEAKER_00: Right?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Did you ever spend time visiting or within the EF or Parity offices?

SPEAKER_01: So I never were in either, either of the offices, but I know numerous people. So Kai Gertler, who's the system administrator for Giveth and a lot of other things was like in ETH Cat Herders.

SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And stuff like that. Why did I want to mention Kai. So he and I put together when COVID hit.

SPEAKER_00: Right?

SPEAKER_01: Okay. Edcon was supposed to be in Vienna, right. And so that was all that was in 2019. And that was the year that I decided to open a Parallel Polis in Vienna.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And I thought, okay, I'll do the launch during Edcon.

SPEAKER_00: Okay.

SPEAKER_01: And I've got all the Ethereum people, you know, here, and then I'll do a side event to announce the launch of Parallel Polis. Right, right. And then it was like, no, Chinese people can't come to Vienna. Right, right. That's. They're like, okay, but we're still do Edcon. Right. And then the full shutdown came, but everybody had their tickets booked to. To Edcon in Vienna. Right. And so I was like, well, fuck it, I'm going to do. I'm going to do. This is before the total shutdown, like, okay, I'm going to do NonCon.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And so I booked a venue and. And then came the full shutdown. And so I did a virtual conference. It was three days with four tracks with I think 80 speakers. And Kai and I wrote a program called Inner Space. And Inner Space was an integrated online convention portal which had integrated Google Calendar and Jitsi video conferencing and integration with Discord and Telegram. Right. So that you had all of the, all of that in one portal.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And we launched that with NonCon. Okay. And so that's all online, right? NonCon onto the Parallel Polis Vienna site. Yeah. So that was, you know, it's just sort of like. Was obvious for me. Like I'm. I'm interested in people who are, who are building. Right. And you know, I'm a true cypherpunk in that sense. You know, deploy the code, show me, do what is you're doing. And I've just been on the convention side and that was. So my, this is where my involvement has been in Ethereum, that and. And community building. Right. And so through that I got to meet pretty much, you know, like everybody, you know, but Gavin Wood was the last one that I actually met personally.

SPEAKER_00: Oh, right.

SPEAKER_01: For the first time here in May. Came to Pizza Day. And so he's speaking here today.

SPEAKER_00: He is speaking in 40 minutes.

SPEAKER_01: In 40 minutes. Right. So yeah, so tangentially, you know, get to meet a lot of the people. I also worked at Brainbot for the Trustlines Foundation.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: With. With Heiko. Yeah, he's and you know, another early person and that's. Yeah, Jacob was there and right. Left us right yeah, yeah. You know, so. But these, these core people, it's, it's. Yeah, yeah. It's so interesting. This whole thing for me is really wild because I never really came. Although there's an ideological underpinning and a natural, you know, do it yourself ethic that comes out of the punk or the hippie, you know, roots it is that I have out of California, where it is that we built the internet, whatever. And I've always just been around, interested in the people and the, you know, the sympathetic people and the doers.

SPEAKER_00: Right, yep.

SPEAKER_01: And they're not necessarily the public faces that you see and everybody knows or that are allowed in the space, you know, because that's a different part. I've just been like, around the devs, you know.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: The silent, you know, the silent underpinning, the silent foundation of what actually happens in the space.

SPEAKER_00: Right. Has Ethereum become what you thought it might be? How much of a. The vision of what could happen there do you think has actually happened?

SPEAKER_01: So I had two viewpoints, I think that are common to early Bitcoiners. Right. Anything that can be built on another chain can eventually be deployed on Bitcoin, right?

SPEAKER_00: Yep. And very common early belief.

SPEAKER_01: And. And so there's this also this sort of like move fast, break things, you know, sort of culture of Ethereum, which I really liked. And I was always a. And I always thought, yeah, cool. I'm really happy that all this stuff is happening on Ethereum like a sandbox.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: And not happening on Bitcoin. Right.

SPEAKER_00: Yep, yep.

SPEAKER_01: So. So I mean, look at the, look at the ecosystem, you know, I think that one of the coolest things that Ethereum enabled was crowdfunding. Right? Yeah, Just this completely alternative economy that created stocks, shareholders, you know what I mean? And it's in a completely new form. That just was so direct.

SPEAKER_00: Yes, right. Yep.

SPEAKER_01: It's like amazing. The whole world should literally work like that. And I. So I love that aspect of Ethereum is that they. Is that they just did it.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: That literally we issued. Created companies, created. Oh, there's no jurisdiction where we can register and do our stuff. It. We're going to build DAOs.

SPEAKER_00: Yep.

SPEAKER_01: You know what I mean? And. And so. So all of this fabulous, permissionless stuff has happened on Ethereum that could not culturally happen on Bitcoin and may not ever actually happen on Bitcoin with the way that it's becoming part of the traditional finance.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: So another thing that I think is really interesting is seeing the. Is seeing what's going on now with actually Enterprise Ethereum.

SPEAKER_00: And you were at the EA at.

SPEAKER_01: The beginning, which was super logical for me. Right. Y. But it was too early because there wasn't really any clients. You were just doing educational work.

SPEAKER_00: Pilots.

SPEAKER_01: Pilots and whatever. But now we're actually there. So, I mean, you know, the promise of Ethereum, I think is well, well, well exceeded its initial sort of, you know.

SPEAKER_00: No, I mean, it is kind of mind blowing to see, you know, these huge, you know, financial companies, you know, saying, yep, you know, we're. We're building an L2 or we're building a, you know, an EVM one. Yep. So, you know, so literally the way.

SPEAKER_01: That I got my first paid job at the Bitcoin Foundation.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Was Jon Matonis, who was the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, went to. Came to Vienna to talk to bankers and diplomats.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: He's like, oh, Michael, so. And I just knew him from Twitter.

SPEAKER_00: Yep.

SPEAKER_01: And he's like, oh, I'm going to be in town. Right. Let's have a coffee. Right. And at that coffee, he said, hey, we listen, we need new branding and a new website for the Bitcoin Foundation. Do you think you can do that? Because there's a vote coming up and it's going to change and we're going to be do. And I agreed to do that. Right. But when he left Vienna, he went to SWIFT.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: This is 2013.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right, right.

SPEAKER_01: So is SWIFT doing anything on Bitcoin? No. Why is it not doing anything on Bitcoin? Because Bitcoiners were too dumb to. To just go ahead and do it back then when add the scripting and composability and everything onto Bitcoin. And the way it is that all the L2s are now doing, all the L2s are a form of Ethereum. Right. So, you know, it's, it's quite wild, quite wild to see. And it's a, you know, huge circle for me just to see that announcement from SWIFT that they're doing an L2, you know.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. So SWIFT. Then you've got Stripe, you know, with Tempo, Stripe and Friends. Kind of looks like a bit of a Libra again, but, you know, same, same kind of tech base. And then Nasdaq announced Robinhood, you had as well.

SPEAKER_01: So, I mean, I always, I always figure that it doesn't really matter where the chains are, who owns them and who controls them, whether they're, you know, degree of centralized or decentralized and whatever, because there's always going to be a bridge. And if there's not a bridge, there's going to be a tokenized representation of it to trade on it. So this sort of idea of a borderless economy, if the cat's out of the bag and everybody is catching up and it's going to be interesting to see where it is that we're at in 10 years. I think that Bitcoiners and Ethereum community are going to be incredibly disappointed. But that's what happens when you percolate the tech into the world. You don't know what's actually going to be the end game. But the fact of the matter is, is that the tech revolution has happened.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

SPEAKER_01: Most certainly.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, thanks so much. Great chatting to you. Great catching up with you as always. And all the very best.

SPEAKER_01: I'll get you some archives for your. For your site.

SPEAKER_00: Excellent. Yeah. Do pictures find goodies? You know, we love digital artifacts. You know, photos, links, you know, find that first tweet, memories. I want to record everything I can.

SPEAKER_01: And thank you so much, man, for being present in my life professionally and personally and in this amazing space, man. You're one of the top people in the space for me, man.

SPEAKER_00: Well, thanks so much. All the very best. Bye.

SPEAKER_01: Bye.
