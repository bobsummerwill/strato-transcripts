And that was sort of like how the beginning of that of people getting together to start doing that happened. So I have like another sort of like interconnection that the first time I ever spent Bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought whiskey for Smari McCarthy

**deepseek:**

> white paper, which then he sent out to some random group of people and they passed it on to further people. And that was sort of like how the beginning of that of people getting together to start doing that happened. So I have like another sort of like interconnection that the first time I ever spent Bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought whiskey for Smari McCarthy and Asta Fish, who were two of the parliamentarians in Iceland from the Pirate Party. Oh, yeah, yeah. And Smari McCarthy, you know, was one of the early WikiLeaks guys, right? Okay. And they were sitting in Jörg Platzer's bar in Berlin, room 77, which is where the earliest Bitcoin meetups were happening. Okay, okay. And also was the first place that you could buy alcohol with crypto with Bitcoin yeah and so smari had uh tweeted that he was going going to york's bar and i was like okay cool i've definitely got to buy you a whiskey so like we did this over twitter and i and i you know i published the tr the transaction you know on twitter right right to see that it was confirmed and i you know bought them whiskey in your bar and And so Jörg Platzer is one of the original members here of Parallel Only Polis, right? Oh, yeah. Right, okay. So the role that I have here now of kind of being the one that packs it all together and gives like a vibe of, you know, where we're at in the space or where we're at in the house was what Jörg used to do here. And so, yeah, there's like an interesting connection. And so Room 77... Yeah, is actually where it is that Vitalik and Gavin decided to literally to actually do a theory. Right. Right. Gavin was introduced to Vitalik by Amir. Yes. Who's also here in the house. And so like this house is really like interconnected for me with all of these people. This social nexus. Yeah, yeah. Because Michael Goolsky who was my partner in Bitcoin is Without Borders, who was the PHP programmer who wrote the module for all of the membership donations to the Bitcoin Foundation, was an original member of this house. And he's the one who introduced me to Amir Taki. Right. And also the one who introduced me to Lynn Ulbricht. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. And he's the guy that started freeross.org. Right, right. So we're really far away from Ethereum history, but it's kind of... Yeah, yeah. To talk about Ethereum in the early days, you have to talk about Bitcoin. Right. Because, you know, it was an ICO on... Right, right. It was an ICO on Bitcoin, right? And you were... not so far away from Berlin all of these years. I mean, did you meet some of these people in Berlin? Was that primarily where? These people were coming through Vienna as well. So we had two spaces in Vienna. We have Metalab, which is the second earliest hackerspace after CCC in Europe. So there was Noisebridge. in San Francisco and CCC and Metalab. So that's where early meetups happened in Bitcoin. But the earliest Ethereum meetups were at Riot, R-I-A-T dot A-T from Matthias Tarsiewicz and Ralph. And they hosted the first Ethereum meetups, which is the first time that I met Vitalik personally. Was that Riot? Right. There you go. Yeah. But yeah, you'd mentioned the yellow paper. So the timeline on that is...

**chatgpt:**

> ...white paper, which then he sent out to some random group of people and they passed it on to further people. And that was sort of like how the beginning of that—of people getting together to start doing that—happened. So I have another sort of interconnection: the first time I ever spent Bitcoin that I earned from the Bitcoin Foundation, I bought whiskey for Smári McCarthy and Ásta Fjeld, who were two of the parliamentarians in Iceland from the Pirate Party. Oh, yeah, yeah. And Smári McCarthy was one of the early WikiLeaks guys, right? Okay. And they were sitting in Jörg Platzer’s bar in Berlin, Room 77, which is where the earliest Bitcoin meetups were happening. Okay, okay. And also was the first place that you could buy alcohol with crypto, with Bitcoin. Yeah. And so Smári had tweeted that he was going to Jörg’s bar, and I was like, okay, cool, I’ve definitely got to buy you a whiskey. So we did this over Twitter, and I published the transaction on Twitter to see that it was confirmed, and I bought them whiskey in Jörg’s bar. Right, right, to see that it was confirmed, and I bought them whiskey in Jörg’s bar. And so Jörg Platzer is one of the original members here of Paralelní Polis, right? Oh, yeah. Right, okay.

Then also when we deployed it, pressing the button, watching the screen—yeah, it’s all live. Because there were actually two that were launched that day, which was Görli and Kotti. So Kotti was the ETC version. Yeah, that’s right. But yeah, that was funded by the ETC Cooperative. That’s fucking hilarious, right?

**Intermediate:**

> So I had two viewpoints I think that are common to early Bitcoiners, right? Anything that can be built on another chain can eventually be deployed on Bitcoin, right? Yep. Very common early belief. And so there's also this sort of like move fast, break things, you know, sort of culture of Ethereum, which I really liked. And I always thought, yeah, cool. I'm really happy that all this stuff is happening on Ethereum. like a sandbox. Right. Yeah. And not happening on Bitcoin. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So so I mean, look at the look at the ecosystem. You know, I think one of the coolest things that that Ethereum enabled was was crowdfunding. Right. Yeah. Just this completely alternative economy that created stocks, shareholders, you know what I mean? And it's in a completely new form that just was so direct. Yes. Right. Yeah. It's like amazing. The whole world should literally work like that. And I so I love that aspect of a theorem is that they is that they just fucking did it. Yeah. That literally we issued created companies, created, oh, There's no jurisdiction where we can register and do our stuff. Fuck it. We're going to build DAOs. You know what I mean? And so all of this fabulous permissionless stuff has happened on Ethereum that could not culturally happen on Bitcoin and may not ever actually happen on Bitcoin. yeah with the way that it's becoming part of the traditional finance yeah yeah so another thing that i think is really interesting is seeing the is seeing what's going on now with actually enterprise ethereum and you were at the ea at the beginning which was super logical for me right yeah but it was too early because there wasn't really any clients you were just doing educational work pilots
