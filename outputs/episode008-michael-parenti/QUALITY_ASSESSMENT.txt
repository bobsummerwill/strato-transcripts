QUALITY ASSESSMENT: EPISODE 008 - MICHAEL PARENTI
================================================================================
Guest: Michael Parenti
Generated: December 16, 2025

Supported Combinations: 12 (3 transcribers × 4 post-processors)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This quality report was refreshed after regenerating all 12 post-processing
outputs (opus, gemini, deepseek, chatgpt) for all 3 intermediate transcripts
(whisperx, whisperx-cloud, assemblyai).

KEY FINDINGS:

1) WORD-COUNT RETENTION is generally good
   Most outputs are ~93–101% of the input transcript word count.

2) TIMESTAMP INTEGRITY in POST-PROCESSED .md is NOT reliable
   Post-processing was run on intermediate .txt transcripts, which do NOT
   contain timestamps. As a result:
   - Some providers emitted NO timestamps at all (md_headers=0).
   - Some providers generated timestamps, but they are largely synthetic.

   If you need accurate timestamps aligned to audio, treat the intermediate
   .md transcripts as the ground truth.

RECOMMENDED OUTPUTS (TEXT QUALITY / RETENTION):

  • AssemblyAI + DeepSeek       (99.9% retention; good content preservation)
  • WhisperX-Cloud + DeepSeek   (101.1% retention; slight expansion)
  • WhisperX + Gemini           (98.6% retention; BUT md is missing timestamps)

NOTE ON “ChatGPT” PROCESSOR:
  ChatGPT outputs have good word retention in some cases, but they do not
  follow the required timestamped markdown format (md_headers=0 everywhere).

INPUT (INTERMEDIATE) TRANSCRIPTS
================================================================================

Word counts (baseline for retention):
  • episode008-michael-parenti_assemblyai.txt:      4,540 words
  • episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx-cloud.txt:  4,316 words
  • episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx.txt:        4,427 words

Timestamp/header counts in intermediate .md (GROUND TRUTH timing):
  • episode008-michael-parenti_assemblyai.md:       194 timestamped headers
  • episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx-cloud.md:    26 timestamped headers
  • episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx.md:         100 timestamped headers

OUTPUT (POST-PROCESSED) WORD COUNT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Legend:
  retention = output_words / input_words
  md_headers = number of "**[MM:SS] SPEAKER_XX:**" headers detected in the .md
  ts_overlap = percent overlap between output timestamps and intermediate .md
               timestamps (unique set overlap; NOT sequence).

QUALITY FLAGS / REVIEW NOTES
================================================================================

1) Formatting non-compliance (missing required timestamped headers)
   The following outputs have md_headers=0, meaning they do not follow the
   required "**[MM:SS] SPEAKER_XX:**" format:
     - episode008-michael-parenti_assemblyai_chatgpt.md
     - episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx-cloud_chatgpt.md
     - episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx-cloud_gemini.md
     - episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx_chatgpt.md
     - episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx_gemini.md

2) Timestamp reliability warning
   Even when md_headers exist, timestamp overlap vs the intermediate .md is low
   (0–14%). This strongly suggests timestamps in outputs are not copied from
   the source transcript and should be treated as synthetic.

RECOMMENDATION:
  • Use intermediate .md files as the canonical timestamped transcript.
  • Use post-processed .txt outputs for corrected wording / readability.
