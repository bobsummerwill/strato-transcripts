SPEAKER_03: Can you hear me?

SPEAKER_01: Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Excellent. Happy Strato spaces. GM. What's up, guys? How are you? I'm good. First week of September. I'm not sure if it's officially the first week of fall. But nevertheless... Super excited for a new month. I know at Strato we have a very exciting month ahead.

SPEAKER_03: I think technically fall starts on the 21st or 22nd, but spiritually it starts after Labor Day, of course. I don't know if anyone has a white suit, but I actually sort of have a white suit. And you can no longer wear those already.

SPEAKER_01: I might have to see that. White suit's pretty nice.

SPEAKER_03: I may have a photo. I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings, and that's the only time it's been. But I could probably dig one up for you, Jamie.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Text, you're welcome. We had him, we lost him. Give it a few more minutes for some more folks to pile in. Yeah, yeah. Spiritually fall is here along with football to the behest of our European counterparts.

SPEAKER_03: By the way, for Spaces Resiliency, Chad GPT is recommending two co-hosts up front. Now, do we already have the two, or can you add another one?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you and Bob are co-hosts.

SPEAKER_03: Okay, it just appears as a speaker to me. Maybe it appears as co-host to Bob on Bob's side. Bob, are you a co-host successfully?

SPEAKER_00: It appears so.

SPEAKER_03: I see it now. Okay, fantastic.

SPEAKER_02: Can you hear me? All right, cool.

SPEAKER_03: Wait, very, very kind of cool August for those of us who spent some of it in New York. August is supposed to be hot, and it mostly wasn't. There's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall, but it feels like it kind of started early this year. I don't know what's going on.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, completely agree. A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night. Cooler. You guys are old. Been around talking about the weather we're waiting for you. Well, I'm here. Even better. Welcome. What's up? GM. Yeah, great, great to kick this off. I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just want to pay my compliments to your PFT texture. It's quite a good one. Thanks, man.

SPEAKER_02: Do you own a texture pump?

SPEAKER_01: I do not, but I saw a few folks with them and obviously noticed yours, so might have to get one.

SPEAKER_02: It was a joke because I thought punks were ugly. So I made myself a better one. And then a friend asked me to make her one and then somebody else asked me to make one. And then like 30 people later, I was like, I should just fucking make a little thing where they can make their own. And then my buddy started a Discord and 10,000 people showed up and I was like, look.

SPEAKER_01: That's some good lore.

SPEAKER_02: That's some great lore right there. I thought it was going to be me and my hundred friends.

SPEAKER_00: Accidental success. Fantastic.

SPEAKER_02: Great.

SPEAKER_00: All right. Well, let's get going. So hi, Texture. How are you?

SPEAKER_02: It's been a while. It's been a long time.

SPEAKER_00: Always good when I think of you. The first thing I think of is love. Oh, and something I've spotted going through making my notes is your Medium is called Peace Love Revolution. Yes, so what's the story there?

SPEAKER_02: So, you know, I was kind of, I wouldn't say a hippie. I didn't dress like a hippie. I didn't really hang out with hippies. But I took some psychedelics when I was a kid and I had some experiences and kind of drove my passion for doing good things and spreading love in the world. I know people that probably follow me are like, what the hell? He just calls people retards all day. Yeah, but I mean, I'm on Twitter. I don't know. It's full of retards.

So I started this group called Peace Love Human because I was sitting in a shitty basement apartment in San Francisco and I was watching the news and I was seeing how religions got all fucked up. And I was like, what if there was like a religion that didn't have any beliefs and we just went out and did nice shit? So for like three years of my life, I was just homeless and had no job and I was setting up like free hug events and other stuff just to make people smile because making people feel loved or making people happy was not like a quantifiable metric, but making people smile was. So that was what I did for my early 20s. So that's what I was doing, the community building. I accidentally started a cult. And when I realized that it was a cult, I shut it down.

**[08:30] UNKNOWN:** Okay.

SPEAKER_02: But it helped me. It was my first foray into cult building, which obviously...

SPEAKER_00: Right. Very useful.

SPEAKER_02: I took into my role in Ethereum, and I feel like the Ethereum cult is going pretty well.

SPEAKER_00: I seem to remember at some point you told me that you've probably hugged a thousand random people on the street.

SPEAKER_02: Oh, a thousand in a day, probably. Probably a hundred thousand more. Yeah. It was nice. It was good. I mean, I could waste this entire thing telling that story. That's probably not what people want to hear.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, I can see why Decentralized Dance Party also appealed to you on that score.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so DDP, Gary, the guy who runs that, he came and stayed at my apartment in Brooklyn, and we had this three-story loft in a warehouse, and we'd let people come crash, and he came through, and that's how I met him, and I've done three or four of them. I was... What is it? It's Tom. I was Tom one time. So that was fun. I had to shave my beard. I had a mustache. I looked funny.

SPEAKER_00: I'll drop some links on Twitter for that for anyone who hasn't seen Decentralized Dance Party or you can go and have a Google on your own. It's quite exceptional.

SPEAKER_02: It's funny. I had no...

SPEAKER_00: Didn't really understand the decentralized thing at that point. I was not really involved, so he was kind of ahead of the curve on that with me for sure. So yeah, that's Gary La Chance who was a fellow Vancouverite with me. He was funnily enough in a photo for the very first item I could find about Vancouver Decentral, the whole Decentral Toronto Vancouver thing. Gary was in that photo for the first one maybe well known as well now but for Doge Claren. So there is the Doge wrapped McLaren, which travels around many conferences where they can get financial support for that. Yeah, Gary's a great guy. It's pretty fun.

So tell me about the vision that you had, which was then the same as the white paper, because on the Twitter thread, I was wrongly saying your mind was blown by the Ethereum white paper, where actually what happened was that you'd had a vision of this about a week before, and then the white paper landed on your lap. So what the hell was that about?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so what actually happened was I had a roommate for years ago, like years when I lived in New York. And he had tried to get me into Bitcoin when it was a dollar. And I said, this is like internet nerd money. I'm like a love revolutionary. I don't give a shit about this. And then he kept bothering me about it for years. And then it hit $1,400. And I was kind of humble enough to be like, well, if other people think it's worth something, I guess it is. But he had texted me and he said, listen, man, I want you to listen to this podcast. And it was the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast with Adam B. Levine and Andreas Antonopoulos.

And so I had given up working in tech because my arms had given out. I was a programmer and designer for a very long time. And I started making cannabis edibles in California because it seemed like an industry that was going to be some pretty easy to get into, like the marketing, the production, everything was shit and I was pretty good at it. So yeah, so I had a girlfriend who was about four hours away, and I would go visit her on the weekends, and so I threw the Bitcoin podcast on, I ate one of my candies, and don't drive stoned, kids. But yeah, on the way there, I was listening and listening to the podcast, and my brain is kind of tuned in, and I had, I like, what could I, I can only describe as like a biblical vision, I would say like before that, I wouldn't have understood what that meant, but like, just this massive data download into my head where I can see, like basically see the future, like visually, like I just saw the whole thing playing out in front of me. And I was like, Oh shit, you know, Bitcoin, I'm still not particularly fascinated by, but the blockchain, this idea has an amazing amount of potential. And I kind of saw how it could help people coordinate. And so it just kind of it struck me so much that I was like, I got to go talk to Adam. I got to go meet the people who did this podcast because at that time it was the only Bitcoin podcast. And I thought anybody who wanted attention for what they were doing would probably contact them.

So the buddy that had told me to listen to the podcast randomly came into town three days later. And I said, hey, man, I've been thinking a lot. I listen to the podcast. I have a lot of ideas. I need to meet Adam. I need to meet. And he goes, well, actually, I'm flying out in a couple of days to go meet him. We have a meeting scheduled. He's in Washington celebrating his birthday with his wife. And I said, no, no, no, no. We're getting in my car right now. I'm driving. I'm driving us there. I'm going, I'm going to go talk to him. And he's like, what really? And I'm like, yeah, fucking cancel your ticket. Like we're getting my car right now. So we drove like 20 hours or whatever to Washington state. I walked in pretty much. I don't know what their meeting was about, but I pretty much just took Adam to the side and we ended up sitting in his hot tub on his balcony for like nine hours just talking. And it was a really cool discussion. And I said, what I want from you is I want you to tell me anybody you know who's working on anything like this. And he said, well, do you know who Vitalik is? I said, man, I'm not in crypto. I'm not in Bitcoin. I don't know. I don't know anybody. I don't know anything. And he said, well, he just sent me this white paper a few days ago. I can forward it to you. And can you guys hear me?

SPEAKER_00: Yep.

SPEAKER_02: Yep. So then, Yeah. So he forwarded me the white paper. I looked at it. You know, to me, it wasn't as comprehensive as the vision that I had, but I thought, you know, this is kids met, you know, right. Like what are the chances that all of this stuff lined up like this? So I said, yeah, make the intro. And so we started a Skype group and, you know, Adam was there. I remember Charles was there. Vitalik was there. I was there. It became the official Ethereum Skype group and just kind of grew from there. So, you know, it was like...

Was that Water Cooler? No, no, no. Water Cooler is something I made later because people... That was later. Yeah, so that was just the literal like main Ethereum Skype channel that we used to communicate for the first I don't know long time right no Water Cooler was something I created later because I actually don't remember why. I guess I was kind of like...

SPEAKER_00: I guess it's off-topic or whatever, probably. Off-topic chatty thing.

SPEAKER_02: Maybe, but I was kind of like the dude that everybody trusted. And so whenever anybody wanted to talk to somebody, they would come talk to me, which is why I got so much information about what was going on all the time. But yeah, so I think it was just an extension of that. People talk to me all the time when we create a little place for us to shoot the shit.

SPEAKER_00: So when do you think you had that trip to Washington? When do you think that would have been?

SPEAKER_02: I'm horrible with time and dates, especially during that time, you know, when you're like a free-flowing hippie dude. Yeah. But I would say it was the week after the week and a half after Vitalik sent the white paper out to his original group of people to get the feedback on.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so it might even have been during November still.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, it was as early as you could get. I mean, just by happenstance, just by the timing I was there, basically the moment we were coming together.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, it's amazing. Cause yeah, so I was able to find that the video of you and Vitalik at the salon, which was beaming into the Vancouver Decentral there. And that was December the 15th. That was. Yeah. You did that one.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So we had been, yeah, I mean, again, the timing, the timing, I don't know, but yeah, obviously by that time we had been doing it for a minute.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, the funny thing was looking at that, that's before there was any code, any public code at least. There wasn't even any Python code from Vitalik published at that point. Gav and Jeff were weeks away still.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And Jeff, to my understanding, just read the white paper and started coding it up on his own and said, hey, I've got this Go implementation.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, pretty much. And the same for Gav. They were both at the very tail end of December, basically like a Christmas project kind of deal for them, for the pair of them.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, it was great. You know, and I've been a developer my whole life since I was a kid. And since I had quit coding, I wasn't really sure where I fit in, you know, but I was really happy when all these other people like got in. I guess maybe if I had dropped some code and gotten a lot more ETH, that would have been cool, but whatever.

SPEAKER_00: So, I mean, to you at that point, like, what was Ethereum? Like, what was this vision? And what were you thinking that that could unfold to be? You know, what was the kernel of that?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so, I mean, it's so hard to remember those days. There's so much on top of it now. You know, I remember the general vibe was just a technology that would allow people to coordinate, to encode value at all dimensions, things that haven't even come to fruition yet, things that people aren't even thinking about because like so much of it has gone to scale, just like fundraising, fundraising locally, like just coordinating anything. I mean, it was just the whole world, like just imagining every single system being replaced by this decentralized coordination structure that gives the you know, some 11-year-old kid in Bangalore could create the next technical development. And I think that kind of platform is just something that seemed really empowering. So a lot of idealism. You know, obviously real life as it's played out is a lot messier and a lot different from how we imagined it. But a lot of idealistic things, a lot of like very much just coordination. And that's a really shitty description of the vision that I had because it was so deep and so multidimensional.

SPEAKER_00: Social operating system is something I've seen you say on a few occasions.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, yeah, just there's so many dimensions to it. But yeah, I mean, a social operating system for allowing people to encode their values or encode literally their values, anything with value, creating incentive structures, contracts that are enforced at the exact level that they were designed to, which none of that sounds really technical and unsexy, but to me it was really about the impact. What happens when you empower people to be able to create value in their local communities or encode value in ways they haven't been able to? What happens when the equity in your company can be easily traded? Just all these things. Just so what happens when you can do that to houses and local businesses and local communities?

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, I'm thinking my own sort of thinking in those early days, it was an awful lot about empowerment and about giving people the ability to control their own destiny. Right. And something I repeatedly thought was if you think about the pyramid of needs. What's it called? I forget the...

SPEAKER_03: Maslow. The hierarchy.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Maslow's right. Maslow hierarchy of needs. I remember a number of times saying it's frankly obscene given all the resources that we have in the world and how much more there is than was in previous years, it's obscene that people should be worried about housing or education or health care or just these basic things. And how wonderful would it be if you could yank up that base layer a little bit so that people are not living in this fearful place of powerlessness but instead can be not worrying about that and not having to make these compromised bad decisions. Just if you could do what you love, what a world that would be. And I'm a lot less idealistic about it now after.

SPEAKER_02: The last decade for a lot of reasons, but you know, the marshmallow test is real, and you can create really good technologies and really good user experiences and as many guardrails as you can for people. But at the end of the day, there's motherfuckers that are going to eat the marshmallow before they even hear the rules, you know, and then they'll do it again and again. So I think there's a lot of it's not that I think the problems are unsolvable, but they're the idea that it's something from above being imposed down. You know, despite the fact that the system seemed to be that way, I think a lot of it is just the level of complexity of modern life relative to the average intelligence. It's just a wide gap, and there's a lot of, I mean, I could talk about that for fucking 10 hours too. So yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, I mean, something that I saw in those early days of Ethereum as well was a real kind of almost like allergic reaction to anything that looked like organization or hierarchy or structure. You know, just this total flip to the opposite side, right? Everything's got to be flat and open and everyone involved with everything, which is just completely impractical for actually organizing or doing anything. It's just nutty. But then it's like I realized it's like hierarchy isn't the problem. Being trapped in a hierarchy where it's to your detriment and you can't get out is the problem. Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And I think a lot of times what happens in that is smart people aren't really, they don't really understand not smart people. And so what happens is we are born into a world where these preexisting hierarchies exist, and they've to some degree or another kind of persisted through generation after generation. And then we come in and we're like, why am I at the bottom of this hierarchy? I'm smart. We're all too smart for this. And then they try to create new systems assuming that everyone is approximately like them, and then you know, I've been through so many because again coming through the hippie I was in the Bay Area for a long time, you see so many people think that they're the first person ever think of flat hierarchies and how it's going to be so much better, and at the end of the day man like that's fine if you want to talk all the time and you want to argue and you want to get nothing done, but at the end of the day, you know, a hierarchy is an information structure and it's also an accountability structure. And so as long as there's accountability at the top and as long as the information is flowing correctly and as long as the outputs are optimal to some degree, then it's the best you're going to get. And it doesn't mean we can't continually improve. Obviously life gets better, and we have an obligation, you know, I think when you're creating things, it's not just the creating things. And I think this is a big problem that still exists in crypto. People think if you build it, they will come. You can't just build it. You have to build it and then you have to make it a button, a single button. It has to be so simple your grandma can do it and not destroy her life. And so it is this kind of perpetual attempt to take these complex structures, simplify them so that everyone has access to them. But through that simplification, not creating these kind of hells that no one can get out of. And I think... Just because of the rate of technological development and the nature of economic progress, our opportunities as people trapped in those systems is to build new systems. But ultimately, we're going to come face to face with the reality of why those systems were set up the way they were and understand that the best we can really hope for in most instances is an optimization of that. We can try to make it simpler, more efficient, better and more adaptable. But those are a lot of dimensions that any one of them out of sync is going to create either more problems or the system itself will collapse. And if the system doesn't exist, nobody gets anything.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, I guess it's a little bit analogous to technical debt and things in code. If you've got code and you're like, Jesus, look at this. It's so much complexity and these conditions. I don't think we need any of that. Let's just take all that out. But someone did that for a reason. You may not know the reason, but you're going to have some consequence if you do that. You can only be so simple without being too simplistic, and then you miss out on that detail. I mean, I guess it's like with US legal stuff, you know, this hot liquid might burn you or whatever. You just know that some shit's happened in the past. The reason that all of these things have happened is someone's done something really fucking stupid.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and after I became a father, I became a huge proponent of the idea of if you think a stupid rule exists because the person who made it is stupid, you haven't thought through the problem. It isn't a bunch of people. I'm not saying this has never existed, but it's not like some nefarious guy at the top who wants to ruin your life. It's some fucking idiot who did some idiot shit. And now you got to make a stupid rule. You know what I mean? And you got to enforce it with fire. Otherwise, your kids end up dumping plates of food in their closet and you find it six months later. And so it's just that at scale.

SPEAKER_00: You're gonna have to keep me on topic as much as you want to because I am a meanderer. On this human side, something I talked about during my maple syrup peace phase was neurodiversity and the fact that normies would not be involved in the early phases of such a project. It's absolutely crazy to go and do what you did. Yeah, it's crazy what most people did. So how does that play out the fact that in these frontier technologies you don't have normal people? Well, you do, but you have a lot of us people who would not fall into that category. So how does that all play out? What do you think is happening there?

SPEAKER_02: I think it's just the structure of how things have always occurred. So you have these kind of people on the front edge. I remember reading when the HTML 2.0 spec was about to come out, and so the early days of the internet it was that. So I was on the internet all day talking to people, and there was a technical barrier, and it's just you have these kind of neurodivergent people show up. So in the early days of crypto, it was a lot of people who are paranoid, a lot of autistic people and a spattering of sociopaths who kind of could see that they could make money. And so that has a profound effect on how things play out. But I think it seems the way that at least in capitalism, what happens is huge amounts of capital come in and it just becomes this kind of probability matrix of throw as much energy at this thing as you can on the front end, and then whatever survives is going to play out. But if you look at something like Linux or open source technology in general, it's very autistic. And autistic people have a very specific differentiation from the average person, which is they honestly believe that the terminal is the greatest interface of all time. They don't grasp that most people need buttons. So it's like you look at Linux, Linux was kind of a fringe thing only tech people used. And then Google came in, and at least had enough sense to hire some designers to turn it into something functional. Steve Jobs did the same thing with OS X. OS X was a previous Unix variant. So you need those people. You need those people who come in who are on the edge, who are technical enough to be able to communicate with the technical people and understand. But they also need the clout, the money, and the power to overrule those people because Linux had very horrible user interface and user experience for a long time, even when they had window managers. You have to understand I was a designer, so I would go into these open source spaces and I'm going to tell you what man like These people who for sure would not let you comment on their code and for sure not let you tell you how they were going to structure it or for sure not tell them what language they were going to use have no fucking problem stepping outside of their own expertise and driving a designer insane. So you really need somebody who has power and the competence and the will and the desire and can put it all together. I don't think we really see that. You know what I mean? The wallets suck. You could, I don't know now but a year ago, I clicked a button and emptied my hot wallet, right? And that shouldn't be possible. How hard is it to throw up a thing that says, hey, are you meaning to send every bit of this? This is a lot of money. You know, why does it not just say, hey, it didn't even say it in dollars. There should have been a massive pop-up that said, you're about to send a hundred thousand dollars to somebody. Are you sure you want to do this? Or as soon as I clicked the button, knew what had happened, even if there had been a five-minute delay. Right. But none of this isn't happening. And the structure of the organizations or if the designers are having to argue with the tech people, like whatever it is, it's just grandma still can't use this shit. It's ten years in. If I found energy, I could within six months we could solve these problems. And I just don't see.

SPEAKER_00: And I guess this is the reason why things like the ETFs are so appealing. Is just yeah, can I just not deal with any of this at all? But I can just use my Courage account I've already got and it's just a thing that I buy or sell right and just you know it's a proxy for it but most people don't care yeah but that reduces it to an investment vehicle. Yeah, it does. And then that's really a failure as you say on delivery of the holistic platform that you do need something which is absolutely better right? It's just like a product question right? It's saying unless the product that you are offering is absolutely better than something existing or is cheaper or gives you some other benefits or whatever, then normal people are not going to use it. It doesn't matter what your worldview is behind that. You've given them something that's worse than what they have, so they don't care.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and so I think exchanges and things like that acting as a buffer, it's a step. Ultimately, how are these things going to be used? The end user is probably not going to know what they're using on the back end any more than the average person knows what processor is in their phone. So no, no, I mean I guess the hope is it's like a layering thing right that you know in the same ways you've got those DeFi primitives that you're going to layer this you know whatever social recovery or buffered amounts or whatever or insurance for up or all this sort of stuff right that you should be able to put together a stack of things that have an equivalent kind of characteristic and experience to existing things, but without that strong dependence on a single legal entity that's you've got that customer service provider kind of pattern rather than just it being raw, dangerous as you experienced.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And to this day, I mean, I feel anxious all the time because I hold crypto. You know what I mean? I think we all do. So it's like that's not an experience that the average person wants. The average person wants to put their money in a bank account. The average person wants to click a button and if something goes wrong, to be able to reverse it. You know, we haven't really addressed any of that. Again, it's a failure because the people who are in charge think like anyone can do what they're doing and it's not that big of a deal. And like all you have to do is do this and like blah blah blah. It's like another if all they have to do is click a button, you've done it. That's your metric for success. Click one button and not worry about anything. You just know the thing's going to happen. And if it doesn't, it'll get fixed.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, when I was looking through sort of different phases of this period that I've been covering in the early days of Ethereum sort of website there, I was noticing so in January and February 2014, there's just such a flood of people that came in. I mean, there were a fair chunk in December, but that just really accelerated through January and February. So, I mean, how did that play out that you've just got tons and tons of people rocking up and really volunteering?

SPEAKER_02: It turned everything into Game of Thrones. Yeah, that's what happened. It turned everything into Game of Thrones. So, like, I was there day one. I was making sure, like, you know, first thing I did was Vitalik posted this website that he made it was piss yellow he had stolen some other shit coin's logo and just put Ethereum on it and I was like please don't post this give me till tomorrow so I spun up a logo sent it to him he was like oh yeah this is kind of what I was thinking I was like thank god please don't put that out. I don't know if I made a website or, and then somebody submitted an image, but the image was like, like, and so just real quick, like what I used to do is I used to be like
