#### [24:37] SPEAKER_06 (block 17/67)

**Intermediate:**

> Yeah, well, I mean, something that I saw in those early days of Ethereum as well was a real kind of almost like allergic reaction to anything that looked like organization or hierarchy or structure. You know, just like this total flip to the opposite side, right? Everything's got to be flat and open and, you know, everything, everyone involved with everything, which is just completely impractical for actually organizing or doing anything. um yeah it's yeah it's just it's just nutty so but then it's like i realized it's like hierarchy isn't the problem being trapped in a hierarchy where it's to your detriment and you can't get out is the problem yeah you know yeah and a lot of and i think a lot of times what happens in that is smart people you know

#### [51:55] SPEAKER_06 (block 34/67)

**Intermediate:**

> the formation of the Ethereum Foundation, right? So the Red Wedding was 3rd of June 2014, where you had that, I guess, that final decision of the foundation happening versus the for profit because you had uh we had people coming notably answer media oreo coming to uh zoob at that point to sign papers right you know it was it was to do with that swiss uh legal entity and then it was like yep no we're not signing the papers the big mess uh and then the foundation uh, was, was July that that was, uh, incorporated and you still have the crowd sale ongoing through July and August. So yeah. And that's a hell of a long span of time. Yeah. We kept saying two weeks. I don't know. That was a meme for a very long time. Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. Well, the website that was up at the time of the Miami conference was showing a countdown to the first of February. That was when the sales were going to start. Yeah. And then, you know, I was with Vitalik when the sale was launched.

It was to do with that Swiss legal entity and then it was like yep, no, we're not signing the papers. The big mess. And then the foundation was July that that was incorporated and you still have the crowd sale ongoing through July and August. So yeah. And that's a hell of a long span of time. Yeah.

#### [1:10:57] SPEAKER_03 (block 51/67)

**Intermediate:**

> if if you look at the early days and and you take all that political seriously and you realize that metallic's basically like a 18 year old kid in the middle of this like i was under prepared for the political but i wasn't even like the center of it you know metallic had to be pushed into this weird situation where all these sharks and snakes were around and where charles is acting some type of way. Um, and then everyone else around him is, is vying for power and that's a lot of stress. Right. And so if I was thinking of it from Vitalik's perspective, to me, my primary goal for myself would be to insulate myself from the, those political games to, to the greatest degree possible. Right. And so, you know, In some ways, it's kind of like the requirement to stay sane and the requirement to insulate yourself from people playing these games and trying to get to you is that you kind of have to anoint yourself king and do the thing that Charles did, which is surround yourself with people who are going to basically have like fealty to you, right? They're not there because they're trying to manipulate you or get one over on you. They're not there because they're not playing games behind your back that you're going to have to deal with. And I think that if you're trying to focus on your goal in this kind of foundational structure, I just assume that every decision that's been made in the structure of the foundation is... Michael Morehead, Based on kind of two principles, one is kind of the the amorphous notion that, like a decentralized project shouldn't have. Michael Morehead, centralized control structure and it, you know there's really some sort of kind of suicide urge that I see in the way that they structure it like it could be an organization that exists for you know. a thousand years if they organize it correctly but they're they're trying as hard as they can it seems to make it disappear and i think that that's like incredibly misguided i don't think there's any historical um examples of anything like that happening and i think that if the foundation disappeared tomorrow then all those power game you know the power vacuum would just create fucking infinity of those power games until somebody stepped up and know ethereum becomes whatever the person who can kind of get that power position so so i think that unfortunately from from my assessment vitalik's need to keep himself sane and protected um is has not been done in such a way that that the ethereum foundation necessarily serves um the long-term uh survival of ethereum uh just like that's a major concern for me. So I don't, I don't, I think a lot of people might criticize the way it's structured for reasons like, but I understand, man, like I'm not Vitalik and I've had to deal with, you know, those power games and they drive you crazy, man. They get in your way. They keep you from being able to focus on what you want to focus on. And I think not coming up through the traditional, um, kind of like Silicon Valley group. When you come up in that, you're surrounded by people who've been in it and have survived for a long time. And they understand how to support founders and they understand how to legally orchestrate these things. And I just don't think that he had those people around him to protect him. So I don't know. Kieran, you got something to say?

**Intermediate:**

> It was pretty fun. The weirdest part about that was meeting Charles. And, you know, Charles, he might have been the first person who was doing kind of the thing that I just said, right? Yeah. He just showed up and kind of inserted himself and was like, I'm going to be CEO. He's just a fucking liar, though, man. He was like 24 or something. 25. Yeah, he presented himself like he was 50 years old and he'd been in tech forever. And here's the thing, man. I actually was probably the most experienced in terms of I'd lived in Silicon Valley. I'd worked in multiple startups. But... Like despite my personality on Twitter or even if you meet me in person, like I'm pretty humble when I get into a group of people that I can tell have skills. So I kind of just sat back and didn't try to insert myself. I didn't try to like demand anything. you know i'd be involved in this or that i just tried to kind of be as helpful as i could um so you know when i when i talked to uh uh charles for the first time i was like all right you know this dude's kind of weird like but well we'll see what's up so like literally the moment i met him in miami i shook his hand and i was like oh god he's a sociopath like okay well maybe he's our sociopath you know like every company has a sociopath like maybe he's like a well-regulated sociopath and then when we got to the miami house i found out no no he's not a well-regulated sociopath he's a fucking compulsive liar manipulative weirdo kieran were you gonna say something

**Intermediate:**

> what's funny when I met your dad, uh, in the Miami house, I just thought he was somebody's dad. I mean, obviously in retrospect, he was yours, but, uh, I didn't know that he would go on to become Joe Lubin. You know, I just remember like shooting shit with them and talking to him about thoughts and stuff. And he was real like quiet and, you know, told me about his time making music videos in Jamaica or whatever.
