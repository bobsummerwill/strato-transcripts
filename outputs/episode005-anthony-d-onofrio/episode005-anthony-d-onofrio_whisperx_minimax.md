**[01:19] SPEAKER_03:** Can you hear me?

**[01:27] SPEAKER_01:** Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Excellent. Happy straddle spaces. GM. What's up, guys? How are you? I'm good. First week of September. I'm not sure if it's officially the first week of fall. But nevertheless... Super excited for a new month. I know at Strato we have a very exciting month ahead.

**[02:25] SPEAKER_03:** I think technically fall starts on the 21st or 22nd, but spiritually it starts after Labor Day, of course. I don't know if anyone has a white suit, but I actually sort of have a white suit. And you can no longer wear those already.

**[02:56] SPEAKER_01:** I might have to see that. White suit's pretty nice.

**[03:02] SPEAKER_03:** I may have a photo. I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings, and that's the only time it's been. But I could probably dig one up for you, Jamie.

**[03:16] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Text, you're welcome. We had him, we lost him. Give it a few more minutes for some more folks to pile in. Yeah, yeah, Spiritually Fall is here along with football to the behest of our European counterparts.

**[03:55] SPEAKER_03:** By the way, for Spaces Resiliency, Chad GPT is recommending two co-hosts up front. Now, do we already have the two, or can you add another one?

**[04:06] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, you and Bob are co-hosts.

**[04:10] SPEAKER_03:** Okay, it just appears a speaker to me. Maybe it appears as co-host to Bob on Bob's side. Bob, are you a co-host successfully?

**[04:18] SPEAKER_00:** It appears so.

**[04:20] SPEAKER_03:** I see it now. Okay, fantastic.

**[04:33] SPEAKER_02:** Can you hear me? All right, cool.

**[04:35] SPEAKER_03:** Wait, very, very kind of cool August for those of us who spent some of it in New York. August is supposed to be hot, and it mostly wasn't. There's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall, but it feels like it kind of started early this year. I don't know what's going on.

**[04:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, completely agree. A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night. Cooler, you guys are old been around talking about the weather we're waiting for you well I'm here even better welcome what's up gm yeah great great to kick this off um I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just want to pay my compliments to your PFT texture. It's quite a good one. Thanks, man.

**[05:37] SPEAKER_02:** Do you own a texture pump?

**[05:40] SPEAKER_01:** I do not, but I saw a few folks with them and obviously noticed yours, so might have to get one.

**[05:51] SPEAKER_02:** it was a joke cause I thought punks were ugly. So I made myself a better one. And then a friend asked me to make her one and then somebody else asked me to make one. And then like 30 people later, I was like, I should just fucking make a little thing where they can make their own. And then, um, uh, then, then my buddy started a discord and 10,000 people showed up and I was like, look,

**[06:15] SPEAKER_01:** That's some good lore.

**[06:16] SPEAKER_02:** That's some great lore right there. I thought it was going to be me and my hundred friends.

**[06:26] SPEAKER_00:** Accidental success. Fantastic.

**[06:32] SPEAKER_02:** Great.

**[06:32] SPEAKER_00:** All right. Well, let's get going. So hi, Texture. How are you?

**[06:39] SPEAKER_02:** It's been a while. It's been a long time.

**[06:44] SPEAKER_00:** always good when I think of you the first thing I think of is love oh and something I've spotted going through making my notes is your medium is called peace love Revolution yes so what's the story there

**[07:05] SPEAKER_02:** so you know uh i was kind of i wouldn't say a hippie i didn't dress like a hippie i didn't really hang out with hippies but i i took some psychedelics and when i was a kid and i had some experiences and uh you know kind of drove my passion for uh you know doing good things and spreading love in the world i know people that probably follow me are like what the he just calls people retards all day uh yeah but i mean i'm on twitter i don't know it's full of retards um so i started this group called peace love human because uh i was like sitting in a shitty basement apartment in san francisco and uh i was watching the news and i was seeing how religions got all fucked up and I was like what if there was like a religion that didn't have any beliefs and we just went out and did nice shit so for like three years of my life I was just like homeless and had no job and wanted to setting up like free hug events and like other stuff just to make people smile because like you know making people feel loved or making people happy was not like a quantifiable metric but making people smile was so that was that was what I did for my early 20s. So that's what I was doing, the community building. I accidentally started a cult. And when I realized that it was a cult, I shut it down.

**[08:30] UNKNOWN:** Okay.

**[08:31] SPEAKER_02:** But it helped me. It was my first foray into cult building, which obviously...

**[08:36] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Very useful.

**[08:38] SPEAKER_02:** I took into my role in Ethereum, and I feel like the Ethereum cult is going pretty well.

**[08:43] SPEAKER_00:** I seem to remember at some point you told me that you've probably hugged a thousand random people on the street.

**[08:50] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, a thousand in a day, probably, probably a hundred thousand more, more. Yeah. It was nice. It was, it was good. I mean, I could waste this entire thing telling that story. That's probably not what people want to hear.

**[09:12] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, I can see why Decentralized Dance Party also appealed to you on that score.

**[09:18] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, so DDP, Gary, the guy who runs that, he came and stayed at my apartment in Brooklyn, and we had this three-story loft in a warehouse, and we'd let people come crash, and he came through, and that's how I met him, and I've done three or four of them. I was... What is it? It's Tom. I was Tom. So Tom is like a rotate. I was Tom one time. So that was fun. I had to shave my beard. I had a mustache. I looked funny.

**[09:55] SPEAKER_00:** I'll drop some links on Twitter for that for anyone who hasn't seen Decentralized Dance Party or you can go and have a Google on your own. It's quite exceptional.

**[10:07] SPEAKER_02:** It's funny. I had no...

**[10:11] SPEAKER_00:** didn't really understand the decentralized thing at that point i was not really involved so that he was kind of ahead of the curve on that with me for sure so yeah that's gary la chance who was a fellow vancouverite with me um he was uh funnily enough in in in a photo for the very first item i could find about vancouver decentral know the whole uh decentral toronto vancouver thing gary was in that photo for the first one maybe well known as well now but for doge claren so there is the doge wrapped mclaren which uh travels around many uh many conferences where they can get uh financial support for that um yeah gary's a great guy it's pretty fun So tell me about the vision that you had, which was then the same as the white paper, because on the Twitter thread, I was wrongly saying your mind was blown by the Ethereum white paper, where actually what happened was that you'd had a vision of this about a week before, And then the white paper landed on your lap. So what the hell was that about?

**[11:40] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, so what actually happened was I had a roommate for years ago, like years when I lived in New York. And he had tried to get me into Bitcoin when it was a dollar. And I said, this is like internet nerd money. I'm like a love revolutionary. I don't give a shit about this. And then he kept bothering me about it for years. And then it hit $1,400. And I was kind of humble enough to be like, well, if other people think it's worth something, I guess it is. But he had texted me and he said, listen, man, I want you to listen to this podcast. And it was the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast with Adam B. Levine and Andreas Antonopoulos. And so I had given up working in tech because my arms had given out. I was a programmer and designer for a very long time. And Uh, I had, I started making cannabis edibles in California because it, uh, it seemed like a, uh, an industry that was going to be, um, some pretty easy to get into like the marketing, the production, everything was shit and I was pretty good at it. So, uh, yeah, so I had, I had a girlfriend who was about four hours away, uh, and I would go visit her on the weekends and I, so I threw the Bitcoin podcast on, I ate one of my candies and, uh, Don't drive stone kids. But yeah, on the way there, I was listening and listening to the podcast and my, my brain is kind of tuned in and I had, I like, what could I, I can only describe as like a biblical vision. I would say like before that, I wouldn't have understood what that meant, but like, just this massive data download into my head where I can see, like basically see the future, like visually, like I just saw the whole thing playing out in front of me. And I was like, Oh shit, you know, Bitcoin, I'm still not particularly fascinated by, but the blockchain, um, This idea has an amazing amount of potential. And I kind of saw how it could help people coordinate. And so it just kind of it struck me so much that I was like, I got to go talk to Adam. I got to go meet the people who did this podcast because at that time it was the only Bitcoin podcast. And I thought anybody who wanted attention for what they were doing would probably contact them. So the buddy that had told me
