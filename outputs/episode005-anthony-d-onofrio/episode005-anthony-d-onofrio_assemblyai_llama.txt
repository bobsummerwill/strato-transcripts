SPEAKER_00: Hear me? Can you hear me?

SPEAKER_01: Yes, I can.

SPEAKER_00: Excellent.

SPEAKER_01: Happy Strato spaces, Gm. What's up, guys?

SPEAKER_02: How are you?

SPEAKER_01: I'm good. First week of September. I'm not sure if it's officially the first week of fall, but nevertheless, super excited for a new month. I know at Strata, we have a very exciting month ahead.

SPEAKER_02: I think technically, fall starts on either 21st or 22nd, but spiritually, it starts after Labor Day. Of course, I don't know if anyone has a white suit, but you can. I actually sort of have a white suit. And you can no longer wear those already.

SPEAKER_01: I might have to see that. White suit's pretty nice.

SPEAKER_02: I may have a photo. I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings, and that's the only time it's been. But I could probably dig one up for you, Bob.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Texture welcome.

SPEAKER_02: We had them. We lost them.

SPEAKER_01: Give it a few more minutes for some more folks to pile in. Yeah, yeah. Spiritually, fall is here, along with football, to the behest of our European counterparts.

SPEAKER_02: By the way, for spaces resiliency, ChatGPT is recommending two co-hosts up front. Now, do we already have the two, or can you add another one?

SPEAKER_01: Yes, you and Bob are co-hosts.

SPEAKER_02: Okay. It just appears as speaker to me. Maybe it appears as co-host to Bob on Bob's side. Bob, are you a co-host successfully?

SPEAKER_00: It appears so.

SPEAKER_02: I see it now.

SPEAKER_03: Okay.

SPEAKER_02: Fantastic.

SPEAKER_04: Can you hear me?

SPEAKER_03: All right, cool.

SPEAKER_02: Wait. Very, very kind of cool. August was supposed to be hot, and it mostly wasn't. There's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall, but it feels like it started early this year. I don't know what's going on.

SPEAKER_01: Like it kind of started early.

SPEAKER_02: Of fall. Yeah, completely agree. A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night were worn.

SPEAKER_04: It was a bit cooler.

SPEAKER_03: You guys are old. Sitting around talking about the weather.

SPEAKER_02: We're waiting for you.

SPEAKER_03: Well, I'm here.

SPEAKER_02: Even better.

SPEAKER_01: Welcome.

SPEAKER_04: What's up, gm?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, great to kick this off. I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just want to pay my compliments to your texture. It's quite good.

SPEAKER_04: You own a texture pump?

SPEAKER_01: I do not, but I saw a few folks with them and obviously noticed yours, so I might have to get one.

SPEAKER_03: It was a joke because I thought punks were ugly, so I made myself a better one, and then a friend asked me to make her one, and then somebody else asked me to make one. And then like 30 people later, I was like, I should just make a little thing where they can make their own. And then my buddy started a Discord, and 10,000 people showed up. And I was like, look.

SPEAKER_01: That's some good lore. That's some great lore right there.

SPEAKER_03: I thought it was going to be me and my hundred friends.

SPEAKER_00: Accidental success. Fantastic.

SPEAKER_04: Great.

SPEAKER_00: Right, well, let's get going. So let's do it. High texture. How are you? It's been a while.

SPEAKER_04: It's been a long time.

SPEAKER_03: Always good.

SPEAKER_00: When I think of you, the first thing I think of is love.

SPEAKER_03: Oh.

SPEAKER_00: And something I'd spotted going through my notes is your Medium is called Peace Love Revolution.

SPEAKER_04: Yes.

SPEAKER_00: So what's the story there?

SPEAKER_04: So, you know, I was kind of a hippie, I wouldn't say. I didn't dress like a hippie. I didn't really hang out with hippies, but I took some psychedelics and had some experiences and drove my passion for doing good things and spreading love in the world.

SPEAKER_04: When I was a kid, and I had some experiences, and kind of drove my passion for doing good things and spreading love in the world. I know people that probably follow me are like, what the heck? He just calls people retards all day.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I mean, I'm on Twitter. I don't know.

SPEAKER_04: It's full of retards.

SPEAKER_03: So I started this group called Peace Love Human because I was like sitting in a shitty basement apartment in San Francisco and I was watching the news and I was seeing how religions got all up in arms, and I was like, what if there was like a religion that didn't have any beliefs? And we just went out and did nice things. So for like three years of my life, I was just like homeless and had no job and wanted to set up like free hug events and like other stuff just to make people smile.

SPEAKER_04: Because making people feel loved or making people happy was not like a quantifiable metric. But making people smile was, so that was what I did for my early 20s.

SPEAKER_04: That was what I did for my early 20s.

SPEAKER_03: So that's what I was doing then, community building. I accidentally started a culture, and when I realized that it was a cult, I shut it down.

SPEAKER_00: Okay.

SPEAKER_04: But it helped me, you know, it was my first foray into cult building, which obviously was very useful.

SPEAKER_00: Right. Very useful.

SPEAKER_04: I took it into my role in Ethereum. And I don't feel like the Ethereum cult is going pretty well.

SPEAKER_00: I seem to remember at some point you told me that you've probably hugged a thousand random people on the street.

SPEAKER_04: Oh my.

SPEAKER_03: Hugs a thousand in a day. Probably a hundred thousand or more.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it was nice.

SPEAKER_03: It was good.

SPEAKER_04: I mean, I could waste this entire thing telling that story. That's probably not what people want to hear.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, I can see why Decentralized Dance Party also appealed to you on that score.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's so DDP. Gary, the guy who runs that, he came and stayed in my apartment in Brooklyn, and we had this three-story loft in a warehouse, and we'd let people come crash, and he came through, and that's how I met him. And I've done three or four of them. I was Tom. So Tom is like a rotate. I was Tom one time. So that was fun.

SPEAKER_04: Had to shave my beard.

SPEAKER_03: I had a mustache. I looked funny.

SPEAKER_00: I'll drop some links on Twitter for that. For anyone who hasn't seen Decentralized Dance Party, or you can go and have a Google on your own. It's quite exceptional.

SPEAKER_03: It's funny, I had no idea about the decentralized thing at that point. I was not really involved. So he was kind of ahead of the curve on that with me for sure.

SPEAKER_00: So yeah, that's Gary Lachance, who is a fellow Vancouverite with me. He was funnily enough in a photo for the very first item I could find about Vancouver Decentralized. You know, the whole decentral Toronto, Vancouver thing. Gary was in that photo for the first one. Maybe well-known now, but for Doge Claren. So there is The Doge wrapped McLaren, which travels around many, many conferences where they can get financial support for that. Yeah, Gary's a great guy.

SPEAKER_03: It's pretty fun.

SPEAKER_04: So.

SPEAKER_00: Tell me about the vision that you had, which was then the same as the white paper, because on the Twitter thread I was wrongly saying your mind was blown by the Ethereum white paper. Actually, what happened was that you'd had a vision of this about a week before, and then the white paper landed on your lap. So what the hell was that about?

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so what actually happened was I had a roommate for years when I lived in New York, and he had tried to get me into Bitcoin when it was a dollar. And I said, I'm not into this. This is like Internet nerd money. I'm like a love revolutionary. I don't give a damn about this.

SPEAKER_03: And then he kept bothering me about it for years, and then it hit $1,400, and I was kind of humble enough to be like, well, if other people think it's worth something, I guess it is. But he had texted me and said, listen, man, I want you to listen to this podcast. And it was the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast with Adam B. Levine and Andreas Antonopoulos.

SPEAKER_04: And so I had given up working in tech because my arms had given out. I was a programmer and designer for a very long time.

SPEAKER_03: I had started making cannabis edibles in California because it seemed like an industry that was going to be pretty easy to get into, like the marketing, the production, everything was.

SPEAKER_04: So I threw the Bitcoin podcast on.

SPEAKER_03: I ate one of my candies, and don't drive stoned kids. But yeah, on the way there, I was listening and listening to the podcast, and my brain just kind of tuned in, and I had like what could I describe as like a biblical vision. I would say like before that, I wouldn't have understood what that meant, but just this massive data download into my head where I could see, like basically see the future, like visually.

SPEAKER_04: Like I just saw the whole thing playing out in front of me, and I was like, oh, you know, Bitcoin I'm still not particularly fascinated by, but the blockchain idea has an amazing amount of potential, and I kind of saw how it could help people coordinate.

SPEAKER_03: And so it just kind of struck me so much that I was like, I got to go talk to Adam. I gotta go meet the people who did this podcast.

SPEAKER_04: Because at that time, it was the only Bitcoin podcast, and I thought anybody who wanted attention for what they were doing would probably contact them. So my buddy that had told me to listen to the podcast randomly came into town three days later, and I said, hey, man, I've been thinking a lot. I listen to the podcast. I have a lot of ideas. I need to meet Adam. I need to meet.

SPEAKER_03: And he goes, well, actually, I'm flying out in a couple days to go meet him. We have a meeting scheduled. He's in Washington celebrating his birthday with his wife. And I said, no, no, no, no. We're getting in my car right now. I'm driving. I'm driving us there. I'm going. I'm gonna go talk to him.

SPEAKER_04: And he's like, what? Really? And I'm like, yeah, cancel your ticket. Like, we're getting in my car right now.

SPEAKER_03: So we drove like 20 hours or whatever to Washington state. I walked in, pretty much. I don't know what their meeting was about, but I pretty much just took Adam to the side, and we ended up sitting in his hot tub on his balcony for like nine hours, just talking.

SPEAKER_04: And it was a really cool discussion. And I said, you know, what I want from you is I want you to tell me anybody who's working on anything like this. And he said, well, you know, do you know who Vitalik is? I said, man, no, I'm not in crypto. I'm not in Bitcoin. I don't know. I don't know anybody. I don't know anything.

SPEAKER_03: And he said, well, he just sent me this white paper a few days ago. I can forward it to you. And can you guys still hear me?

SPEAKER_00: Yep, yep.

SPEAKER_03: My little thing's not showing. So then, yeah, so he forwarded me the white paper.

SPEAKER_04: I looked at it. You know, to me, it wasn't as comprehensive as the vision that I had.

SPEAKER_03: But I thought, you know, this is kids met right. Like, what are the chances that all the stuff lined up like this? So I said, yeah, make the intro. And so we started a Skype group. And Adam was there. I remember Charles was there. Vitalik was there.

SPEAKER_04: I was there.

SPEAKER_03: It became the official Ethereum Skype group, and just kind of grew from there.

SPEAKER_00: Was that Water Cooler?

SPEAKER_04: No, no, no.

SPEAKER_03: Water Cooler is something I made later because people were talking about stuff that was probably off-topic or whatever.

SPEAKER_00: Right?

SPEAKER_04: No, Water Cooler was something I created later because I actually don't remember why people were talking about stuff that was off-topic.

SPEAKER_03: But like I was kind of like the dude that everybody trusted. And so like whenever anybody wanted to talk to somebody, they would come talk to me, which is why I got so much information about what was going on all the time.

SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, so when, when do you think you had that trip to Washington? When do you think that would have been?

SPEAKER_03: I'm horrible with time and dates, especially during that time, you know, when you're like a free-flowing hippie dude.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: But it was, I would say it was the week after the, the week, week and a half after Vitalik sent the white paper out.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_03: To his original group of people to get feedback on.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So it might even have been during November still.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean it was as early as you could get. I mean just by happenstance, just by the timing, I was there, the basically the moment we were coming together.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing because, yeah. So I was able to find that video of you and Vitalik at the salon, which was beaming into the Vancouver Decentral there. And that was December 15th. That was you did that one.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So we had been doing it for a minute.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: I mean again, the timing, the timing. I don't know. But yeah, obviously by that time, we had been doing it for a minute.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean the funny thing was looking at that, that's before there was any code, any public code, at least. There wasn't even any Python code from Vitalik published at that point. Gavin and Jeff were weeks away still.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: And Jeff to my understanding just read the white paper and started coding it up on his own and said, hey, I've got this Go implementation.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, pretty much. And the same for Gav. They were both at the very tail end of December. Basically like a Christmas project kind of deal for them.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, no, it was great.

SPEAKER_04: You know, and I've been a developer my whole life, since I was a kid.

SPEAKER_03: And since I'd quit coding, I wasn't really sure where I fit in, you know, but I was really happy when all these other people got in.

SPEAKER_04: I guess maybe if I'd have dropped some code and gotten a lot more ETH, that would have been cool.

SPEAKER_03: But whatever.

SPEAKER_00: So I mean, to you at that point, like what was Ethereum? Like what was this vision, and like what were you thinking that that could unfold to be? You know, what was the kernel of that?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so I mean it's so hard to remember those days. There's so much on top of it now. You know, I remember the general vibe was just a technology that would allow people to coordinate, to encode value, I mean, you know, like just at all dimensions.

SPEAKER_04: Things that haven't even come to fruition yet, things that people aren't even thinking about.

SPEAKER_03: Because so much of it has gone to scale. Just like fundraising, fundraising locally, like just coordinating anything. I mean it was just the whole world like just imagining every single system being replaced by this decentralized coordination structure that gives some 11-year-old kid in Bangalore the ability to create the next technical development.

SPEAKER_04: And you know, I think that kind of platform is just something that seemed really empowering. So a lot of idealism, you know, obviously real life as it's played out is a lot, a lot messier and a lot different from how we imagined it.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but yeah, social operating system is something I've seen you say on a few occasions.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, yeah, just there's so many dimensions to it.

SPEAKER_03: But yeah, I mean, a social operating system for allowing people to encode their values or encode anything with value, creating incentive structures, contracts that are enforced at the exact level they were designed to.

SPEAKER_04: Which none of that's really technical and unsexy, but to me it was really about the impact, you know, what happens when you empower people to create value in their local communities or encode value in ways they haven't been able to.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I think in my own thinking in those early days, it was an awful lot about empowerment and about giving people the ability to control their own destiny.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: And something I repeatedly thought was like, if you think about Maslow's hierarchy of needs, you know, it's frankly obscene given all the resources we have in the world and how much more there is than was in previous years, it's obscene that people should be worried about housing or education or healthcare or just these basic things.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: And how wonderful would it be if you could like yank up that base layer a little bit so that people are not living in this fearful place of powerlessness, but instead can be like not worrying about that shit and not having to make these bad, compromised decisions.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Just if you could do what you love, what a world that would be.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And I'm a lot less idealistic about it now after the last decade for a lot of reasons, but the Marshmallow Test is real, and you can create really good technologies and really good user experiences and as many guardrails as you can for people.

SPEAKER_04: So I think there's a lot of problems that are unsolvable, but they're not that I think the idea that it's something from above being imposed down.

SPEAKER_04: Despite the fact that the system seemed to be that way, I think a lot of it is just the level of complexity of modern life relative to the average intelligence is just a wide gap, and there's a lot of things that need to be simplified.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, I mean, something that I saw in those early days of Ethereum as well was a real kind of almost like allergic reaction to anything that looked like organization or hierarchy or structure. You know, just like this total flip to the opposite side. Everything's got to be flat and open and everything, everyone involved with everything.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Which is just completely impractical for actually organizing or doing anything. And then it's like I realized it's like hierarchy isn't the problem. Being trapped in a hierarchy where it's to your detriment and you can't get out is the problem.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and a lot of times what happens in that is smart people, not smart people, and so what happens is we are born into a world where these pre-existing hierarchies exist and have persisted through generation after generation.

SPEAKER_03: And then we come in and we're like, why am I at the bottom of this hierarchy? I'm smart. We're all too smart for this. And then they try to create new systems assuming that everyone is approximately like them.

SPEAKER_04: And then you know, I've been through so many because again, coming through the hippie movement, I was in the Bay Area for a long time. You see so many people think that they're the first person to ever think of flat hierarchies and how it's going to be so much better.

SPEAKER_03: And at the end of the day, man, like that's fine if you want to talk all the time and you want to argue and you want to get nothing done. But at the end of the day, a hierarchy is an information structure, and it's also an accountability structure.

SPEAKER_04: And so as long as there's accountability at the top, and as long as the information is flowing correctly, and as long as the outputs are optimal to some degree, then it's the best you're going to get.

SPEAKER_03: And it doesn't mean we can't continually improve. Obviously, life gets better, and we have an obligation to create things and make them simpler, more efficient, better, and more adaptable.

SPEAKER_04: But those are a lot of dimensions that any one of them out of sync is going to create more problems or the system itself will collapse.

SPEAKER_03: Right. And if the system doesn't exist, then nobody gets anything.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a little bit analogous to sort of technical debt and things in code.

SPEAKER_04: Yep.

SPEAKER_00: If you've got code, and there's complexity and conditions, and you're like, Jesus, look at this. Let's just take all that out. But someone did that for a reason. You may not know the reason, but you know it was done for a reason.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and I think as a father, I became really a huge proponent of the idea that if you think a stupid rule exists because the person who made it is stupid, you haven't thought through the problem.

SPEAKER_03: It isn't a bunch of people now. I'm not saying this has never existed, but it's not like some nefarious guy at the top who wants to ruin your life. It's some idiot who did some stupid thing, and then now you got to make a stupid rule.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and you got to enforce it with fire. Otherwise, you know, your kids end up dumping plates of food in their closet, and you find it six months later.

SPEAKER_04: So, you know, it's just status scale. But you're going to have to keep me on topic as much as you want to, because I am a meanderer.

SPEAKER_00: On this human side, something I talked about during my Maple Syrup Peace phase was neurodiversity and the fact that normies would not be involved in the early phases of such a project.

SPEAKER_04: That was crazy what most people did.

SPEAKER_00: So how does that play out? The fact that in these frontier technologies, you don't have normal people. Well, you do, but you have a lot of people who would not fall into that category. So how does that all play out? What do you think's happening there?

SPEAKER_04: I think it's just the structure of how things have always occurred. You have these kinds of people on the front edge. And I was on the Internet from, you know, I remember reading when the HTML 2.0 spec was about to come out.

SPEAKER_03: And so the early days of the Internet, it was that. And so I was on the Internet all day talking to people, and there was a technical barrier.

SPEAKER_04: And it's just you have these kinds of neurodivergent people show up. So in the early days of crypto, it was a lot of people who were paranoid, a lot of autistic people, and a sprinkling of sociopaths who kind of could see that they could make money.

SPEAKER_03: And so that has a profound effect on how things play out. But I think it seems the way that at least in capitalism, what happens is huge amounts of capital come in, and it just becomes this kind of probability matrix of throwing as much energy at this thing as you can on the front end.

SPEAKER_04: And then whatever survives is going to play out. But kind of if you look at something like Linux or open-source technology in general, it's like very autistic.

SPEAKER_03: And autistic people have a very specific differentiation from the average person, which is they honestly like believe that the terminal is the greatest interface of all time.

SPEAKER_04: It's like they don't grasp that most people need buttons. And so it's like you look at Linux, Linux was kind of a fringe thing, only tech people used.

SPEAKER_03: And then Google came in and at least had enough sense to hire some designers to turn it into something functional. Steve Jobs did the same thing with OSX.

SPEAKER_04: You know, OSX was a previous Unix variant. And so you need that, you need those people, you need those people who come in who are on the edge, who are technical enough to be able to communicate with the technical people and understand.

SPEAKER_03: But they also need the clout, the money, and the power to overrule those people.

SPEAKER_04: Because like Linux had a horrible user interface and user experience for a long time, even when they had window managers.

SPEAKER_03: And you have to understand, I was a designer. So I would go into these open-source spaces, and I'm like, these people who for sure would not let you comment on their code and for sure not let you tell them how they were going to structure it.

SPEAKER_04: Have no problem stepping outside of their expertise and driving a designer insane.

SPEAKER_03: You know what I mean? Very logical, unemotional, totally tapped out of any sense of what a normal person needs.

SPEAKER_04: And they just beat the designers into the ground. So you really need somebody who has power and the competence and the will and the desire and can put it all together.

SPEAKER_00: The wallets fucking suck. I don't know now, but a year ago, I clicked a button and emptied my hot wallet.

SPEAKER_04: And that shouldn't be possible. How hard is it to throw up a thing that says, hey, are you meaning to send every bit of this? This is a lot of money.

SPEAKER_03: You know, like, why does it not just say hey?

SPEAKER_04: It didn't even say it in dollars, do you know what I mean? It was obfuscated.

SPEAKER_03: It didn't even say there should have been a massive pop-up that said you're about to send a hundred thousand dollars to somebody. Are you sure you want to do this?

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_04: Or, or, or I, as soon as I clicked the button, knew what had happened. Even if there had been like a five-minute delay.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_04: Anything. There's, there's. But none. This isn't happening. Right. And whether it be the structure of the organizations or, you know, if the designers are having to argue with the tech people, like whatever it is, it's just grandma still can't use this.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, I guess I, I guess this is the reason why things like the ETFs are so appealing. Can I just not deal with any of this at all? But I can just like use Bridge account I've already got, and it's just a thing that I buy or sell.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah. But that reduces it to an investment vehicle.

SPEAKER_00: It does, it does, it does.

SPEAKER_04: And maybe it does. And then that's really a failure, as you say, on delivery of the holistic platform that you do need something which is absolutely better.

SPEAKER_00: Right. It's just like a product question really. Unless the product that you are offering is absolutely better than something existing or is cheaper or gives you some other benefits or whatever, then normal people are not going to use it.

SPEAKER_04: Correct.

SPEAKER_00: Doesn't matter what the worldview is behind that. You've given them something that's worse than what they have, so they don't care.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And so, you know, I think exchanges and things like that kind of acting as a buffer is a step.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I guess the hope is it's like a layering thing, right? That you know, in the same way as you've got those DeFi primitives that you're going to lay, you know, whatever social recovery or buffered amounts or whatever, or insurance for UPS or all this sort of stuff.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: That you should be able to put together a stack of things that have an equivalent kind of characteristic and experience to existing things, but without that strong dependence on a single legal entity.

SPEAKER_03: Right.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and I mean, you know, to this day, I mean, I feel anxious all the time because I hold crypto.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I think we all do.

SPEAKER_04: So it's like that's not an experience that the average person wants. The average person wants to put their money in a bank account. The average person wants to click a button and if something goes wrong, to be able to reverse it.

SPEAKER_03: You know, we haven't really addressed any of that.

SPEAKER_04: That's a failure because the people who are in charge think like anyone can do what they're doing, and it's not that big of a deal.

SPEAKER_03: And like, all you have to do is do this, and like, blah, blah. It's like, no, dude, if all they have to do is click a button, you've done it.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, when I was looking through different phases of this period that I've been covering in the early days of Ethereum, sort of on the website, there was just such a flood of people that came in.

SPEAKER_04: Turned everything into Game of Thrones.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's what happened. It turned everything into Game of Thrones. So like I was there day one, I was making sure, like, you know, the first thing I did was Vitalik posted this website that he made. It was piss yellow. He had stolen some other shit, coins logo, and just put Ethereum on it.

SPEAKER_03: And I was like, please don't post this. Give me till tomorrow.

SPEAKER_04: So I spun up a logo, sent it to him. He was like, oh, yeah, this is kind of what I was
