SPEAKER_00: What are you using? I use Restream. We try to use something and it streams on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

SPEAKER_01: So we’re using StreamYard too. We’re using StreamYard, and I’m just double-checking.

SPEAKER_02: We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit…

SPEAKER_03: None of them are perfect.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. I’ll share the one. I don’t know if you should try this one, but this one looks pretty cool, pretty great.

SPEAKER_02: Because you’re thinking there must be good software for this, right? It’s such a common need. Like, isn’t there just an answer that just works?

SPEAKER_00: But the thing is, those platforms, they’re not built with interoperability in mind.

SPEAKER_03: They don’t like it.

SPEAKER_02: They want to trap you in.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly. That’s against our vision, you know.

SPEAKER_02: X, there isn’t even a means to download the bloody audio.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it’s…

SPEAKER_02: Why would you want to download it?

SPEAKER_00: You know, that’s something, I guess the next step in maybe…

SPEAKER_02: Like, you want to use it somewhere else.

SPEAKER_00: Are you seeing somebody else be able to own your data? In all those platforms, they even own a query or just access. Something I love about Google is I can activate the tracking, but at least I can go and say, “What did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store, it was pretty nice,” and I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have thousands of data points, but they don’t even share it with you.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.

SPEAKER_00: I find it quite… quite wild.

SPEAKER_03: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1…

SPEAKER_01: We are live. So we’re live. No, no, I’m ready. No, but that was a good cold intro, right? So we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us, for a change, are live in real life, in the same room. In the same room.

SPEAKER_02: Amazing.

SPEAKER_01: And you are a special guest, Reda.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sure. So yeah, we have here today with us Reda Meslan, who is the Executive Director of the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years.

SPEAKER_03: Healthy run.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly.

SPEAKER_02: Right.

SPEAKER_03: So yeah, like it’s eight years now.

SPEAKER_00: It was 2017, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: February 2017 was the launch date, on the 28th.

SPEAKER_03: There was pre-work solidly before, at least three months, maybe more.

SPEAKER_02: There were meetings I was part of in December and January. Those were the first big meetings.

SPEAKER_01: Right.

SPEAKER_02: You know, with whatever, 30, 40 people. Crazy amounts. But yeah, it really started probably at Devcon 2. Really close with the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

SPEAKER_03: There was the kickoff meeting at the J.P. Morgan office, which was pretty big. And even before, there were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft.

SPEAKER_02: Right. So that public launch was February.

SPEAKER_03: It was February.

SPEAKER_00: But…

SPEAKER_02: But December there was an internal one. And then J.P. Morgan was in January 2017. But yeah, a lot of those initial contacts had happened at Devcon 2 in October the previous year.

SPEAKER_01: Well, in the Devcon 2…

SPEAKER_03: Oh yes.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so basically, there was a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And yeah, the group of people, which was I think about six people, that were interested met at like a Starbucks just off-site. And that was sort of the idea-formation thing about the…

SPEAKER_02: And then Matt Spoke of Nuco held a little bar side event as well. Which… do we have some technical issues?

SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay, hold on a second.

SPEAKER_03: I’m just gonna push…

SPEAKER_00: James is gonna tell everybody we have a technical issue.

SPEAKER_02: Everybody…

SPEAKER_01: I can… I will fix that. Oh, did I… I messed up the Twitter.

SPEAKER_02: You did a bad one.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I did a bad one. So everyone, please join us on YouTube.

SPEAKER_03: Spaces at 5 a.m., right.

SPEAKER_01: Yes.

SPEAKER_02: But yeah, Matt Spoke held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to, and there were various others there. I don’t know if you went to that one as well.

SPEAKER_01: I didn’t go to that one. So I think it’s… I think the main thing was that… yeah. I’m gonna try and fix this right now on Twitter, live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now. If not, I did choose a…

SPEAKER_02: But also parallel in that, because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, there was an “enterprise Slack” set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise.

SPEAKER_01: That’s right.

SPEAKER_02: So at some point he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was not quite the same group. It was a larger group, but slightly different.

SPEAKER_01: Nuco was part of that.

SPEAKER_02: Nuco was part of that also.

SPEAKER_01: By the way, we should introduce ourselves.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Hi, I’m Bob Summerwill. I’m Head of Ecosystem at STRATO, BlockApps.

SPEAKER_03: James Lubin, CEO of BlockApps. We’re creators of STRATO.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer, BlockApps. So, sorry, back…

SPEAKER_00: But…

SPEAKER_02: But yeah, Amos as well.

SPEAKER_01: Do you remember them?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we should check in on… I haven’t thought about Amos in several years, until the moment.

SPEAKER_02: So the interesting thing about what they were doing: that was like some Taiwan bank consortium thing.

SPEAKER_01: Yep.

SPEAKER_02: But then they did work on Chinese cryptography and stuff. Like, they’ve got differing requirements, right?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: And Masterchain, which was in Russia, that was like a Sberbank thing.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: I have a question because you have… I was not at EEA at that time, and so it’s very interesting for me. You were part of those early conversations. This was created by 13, I think, companies. It was a pretty big event.

As you mentioned, J.P. Morgan and everything, all those big names coming into the ecosystem. What were the hopes and really the overall atmosphere when the EEA was created eight years ago?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, I mean, ConsenSys were very critical as well because they were doing a load of the enterprise engagement stuff, right? You’ve got many, many companies starting to get interested in, “Hey, we want to do a pilot, we want to get involved.” So ConsenSys were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together. But yeah, over those months, you really had a hell of a lot of momentum really, really quick.

SPEAKER_03: So the observation during Devcon 2, when the idea was hatched, was basically that, at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had hacked their own consensus algorithms and security…

SPEAKER_02: And many Geths.

SPEAKER_03: Many Geths indeed. We learned later that a lot of J.P. Morgan’s Quorum was initially built by Jeff Wilcke. He had some kind of…

SPEAKER_02: And that was not announced at the time of Devcon 2. That was still behind the scenes for a few months, but happened just before the EEA started. But yeah, you’ve got all of this stuff brewing up. I mean, for years earlier, if you think of ErisDB, that became Monax, that became Hyperledger Burrow. So that was a permissioned Ethereum client, off PoC5, pre-mainnet.

Mid 2014, of sticking Tendermint onto an EVM. So yeah, it was all a bit smashed apart, but it was like, “The time is right for us to work together because we’ve all got the same needs.”

SPEAKER_03: Us too. We had our own client and it got used in a bunch of the ConsenSys consulting engagements at that time. And we started even then kind of tuning it for enterprise. And so I guess the idea was like, well, maybe enterprises won’t adopt if there isn’t a standard for all of this new stuff that they need that’s above and beyond the base.

SPEAKER_01: Well, Ethereum clients, I think it was even beyond that. There was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company, siloed, to get Ethereum to do what they wanted to do in a private way. So everyone was holding on to these things. And what came out of those early conversations at Devcon was, “Wait, we’re all doing similar things. Maybe if we all kind of work together, we could do it faster and get this up faster.” And that was all around private Ethereum.

SPEAKER_02: And I guess also like a marriage between customers of these things and builders.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Of saying, you’ve got all these kind of startup-y companies that are making Ethereum things, and you’ve obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this. But it’s…

SPEAKER_01: There’s…

SPEAKER_02: But yeah, on that standardization side, there was nothing. And it’s like, you’re all going to get vendor-locked instantly and it’ll all just be arbitrarily different and painful and horrible. So let’s try and work out…

Because at some point as well with Quorum, it was kind of like, you know, are we gonna collaboratively do code bases as well? Hyperledger was another piece into this. A few months earlier, I’d spent a bunch of time working on relicensing the C++ client to get back to Apache 2.0 so it could have been contributed into Hyperledger, and we could have gathered around that.

So the EEA was kind of a backup, I guess, of, “Right, we can’t have this grand fusion, but there’s enough happening on the Ethereum side that we can at least get all the Ethereum pieces together.” And then, yeah, I guess it went quite quickly from, “Okay, we don’t want to straight compete with Hyperledger.” Having a shared code base also kind of screws…

SPEAKER_03: No one wanted to. So I think, in the spirit of spiciness, I think the enterprise users would have preferred a shared code base.

SPEAKER_02: Right.

SPEAKER_03: And they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor-locked again. They’ve had these horrific IBM nightmares, Oracle nightmares over the years, and they’re just like, “Not this time.”

SPEAKER_01: We’re not going to live through this.

SPEAKER_02: I mean also, you’ve got that market pressure, right, of Corda coming out, of IBM launching Fabric.

SPEAKER_01: They were worried it would end up…

SPEAKER_03: That kind of nominally open source but quite proprietary.

SPEAKER_02: So those were both shooting for release in February 2017. So that kind of timeline is like, “Right, we’ve got to get our shit together to be able to do an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM and R3 at that time.”

SPEAKER_03: Like, I remember one of our prominent enterprise users, EEA members, said, “Yeah, they’ve got a call with 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks,” let’s say.

SPEAKER_01: Right.

SPEAKER_03: And it’s funny that all of the Ethereum just survived all of this more or less not paying any attention, and this competition kind of came in.

SPEAKER_01: Well, I think there was another parallel thing that was happening at that Devcon. There were the first enterprise use cases we talk about today. Like, for example, Santander talked about US dollars on-chain, which we all recognize as a stablecoin now, and…

SPEAKER_03: Tokenized bank deposit.

SPEAKER_00: You see, Victor, I think that’s a very cool parallel. Like, you set the stage pretty well for where it’s coming from and where it started eight years ago. You mentioned innovation labs starting to contribute to some code, and we’ve known the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it’s only actually now, and it’s been probably for the last year, that things have been really changing drastically.

And to take your words for “innovation,” it’s not innovation labs anymore looking at how they implement blockchain in their ecosystem. It’s really executive teams that say, “Hey, we want to plan what is the production, like how we get into market.”

SPEAKER_03: Thankfully, they’re scared now. So they better move, or else.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, I don’t know if it’s like there’s no… but there were some interesting talks. When we were at Sibos, like the SWIFT conference…

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we should mention that, because you were just at Sibos and you’re dealing with what we think of as “shared by institutional players,” and that’s where you have a lot of communication. So what were your impressions about where they’re at with that? Because that’s the other side that we talk about.

SPEAKER_00: The digital asset tokenization is definitely a hot topic. Everyone is looking because they know it’s happening. They want to be involved. And now especially, there is less regulatory…

SPEAKER_03: The listeners may not know what Sibos is.

SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_00: So Sibos is the big SWIFT conference. SWIFT, if you’re not familiar, is a messaging system that a lot of 11,000 financial institutions around the world use. It’s actually a co-op, it’s a DAO for TradFi. Kudos to Danielle from ConsenSys who said that to me once.

SPEAKER_03: It is, although it’s like, can we buy in now? I feel like…

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the token is having probably a bank license.

SPEAKER_03: The London Metal Exchange is like this too. It’s like you want to sign up, you got to buy a bunch of shares, and then there’s an annual fee and whatnot, and you have to put someone there all the time.

SPEAKER_02: You have to join the trade guild.

SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes.

SPEAKER_02: You’ve got to do your…

SPEAKER_01: Yes.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly. And so Sibos is the big mecca of payments, I would say, every year. So you have all the big financial institutions, also global financial institutions, like clearinghouse settlements—like you work there—DTCC, etc., but also all the banks. They gather there, and there is a lot of conversation.

What is very interesting is actually Sibos and SWIFT is a very standards organization, because what they do is: how we make sure we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. They used to have a different kind of messaging format, and recently now they’re migrating to something new, which is ISO 20022.

Which is, if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really how every financial institution wants to “discuss.” They’ve been working on that spec for a long time, and that’s how anything that can touch finance—from securities to payments—has to be qualified.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think it’s good to explain. Most of finance gets cleared through messaging. Crypto people are used to putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere.

SPEAKER_00: Yes.

SPEAKER_03: It’s not really like this.

SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, thank you. That is a very key point. The process of what we call delivery versus payment (DvP) in traditional finance is a pretty complex thing because how you make sure when you deliver the money, the money has been received; that you receive the asset; that everything has been… and it’s a kind of dance. You receive a message, you send another one.

And it’s not like how we used to do in crypto: we submit and it’s actually an atomic transaction, which is like just one thing. And when the transaction is complete, you know it’s been executed, it’s been delivered, and all the parties… That is actually, you know, I give you the can; I know you’ve been giving me the money.

Where actually there is like a little bit of dance: “Well, I put the can here. You see the can that has been moving here, you send the money.” So the blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things like T+1 or T+2 for some of those different exchanges—now you do it, depending on what chain you’re going to deploy, between a second to even less than that.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: And also SWIFT isn’t a payments mechanism, right?

SPEAKER_00: No, it’s messaging.

SPEAKER_02: That’s another common…

SPEAKER_03: Let me interject with a specific example.

SPEAKER_03: I think they’re biggest in FX, right? So let’s say I’ve got some USD, I want some Euro, and we kind of agree to a USD/EUR trade. We look up whatever the pair is trading at, and I think it’s like: I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to SWIFT, and you do too, and then SWIFT checks if it matches, it charges like seven bucks either way. If it does match, then it’ll tell us that it matched.

SPEAKER_00: Well, I don’t think it’s exactly this way. It’s more: SWIFT offers a type of envelope and a format of envelope, and paper and ink that we know how to use and how we’re supposed to fill up some forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants. It’s not so much people… there’s gonna be corresponding banking locally, they can do cash, and everyone is gonna take their share.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. It’s not moving the asset. It’s like I have the USD on my bank…

SPEAKER_00: On your bank talking to each other in a secure and compliant way, because it’s also: you send that, you have to send some specific messaging for compliance; then I send another one, “Hey, I checked there’s information,” and you…

SPEAKER_02: You know, a bunch of local-jurisdiction-specific…

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. A lot of different handshakes.

SPEAKER_01: I like the way someone described it: it’s like a funny TCP handshake. What they’re doing is tracking the transfers, but no money is actually moving. And then they have a list of IOUs. So when I send a SWIFT transaction—let’s say I send a hundred dollars to you—and I go to my bank, I put in a hundred dollars, the money doesn’t go anywhere. You’re just…

SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_00: So I have to write USD off. Then at the end of the day…

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: RTGS, they’re gonna do the transfer actually.

SPEAKER_03: That’s like a different messaging.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: If you research—and I’m not a SWIFT expert, but I have learned that the last couple of months, I’ve done a little bit more deep dive—it’s fascinating because there is such a huge dance between two transfers of money because you have the money in your bank account, but then actually central bank money, then you have also the deposit money. Those are what you call M0, M1, M2. And so all of that is pretty complex.

And then we’re just talking about payment here. Talking about securities or those other financial instruments that you can exchange also using blockchain in a very efficient way. But that’s… using stablecoins you can make everything super simple.

And also one misconception maybe I would love to mention is: we talked about stablecoins and CBDCs. They’re actually exactly the same thing. It’s just in a different context. A CBDC is a stablecoin for central banks.

SPEAKER_02: And it’s just the issuer.

SPEAKER_00: It’s just the issuer is not the same as, you know… We’re never going to retouch CBDCs because this is like the money of banks, if you say. But almost, I think from a technical level, it’s very almost like a copy-paste of the same contract. The mechanism—it’s not—but we create a whole different language and terminology for that. But they’re actually very similar.

And funny fact: those CBDCs, they’ve been doing… I think the baby needed to grow. You know, like said Devcon 2: it was a two-year-old kid, Ethereum, and we were like, “Hey, come in here, you can manage the most critical infrastructure of the planet, which is our money and how we do trade, and you can do all of this.”

And I think the Ethereum Foundation—I have to give them credit—for a long time they were saying, “Hey guys, you’re not considering the enterprise,” everything. But I think they did the right thing because they protected that baby so it could grow and it become more mature. It’s more than 10 years. It’s still not even a teenager—the analogy with humans is going to take some limits. But we had a point now where we have a technology and Ethereum is really a capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing… you know, that were blocking institutions to adopt, which is scalability, privacy, composability, and interoperability—the four points that you had in the ARC paper from Circle.

And now we have this—just last week zkSync announced up to 15,000 TPS—and there is some new thing that almost every week is going on. So we really like now the technology, when it can look and say, “Well, I need to make sure this is private. I need to make sure this is going to be executed in a seamless way.” Also the decentralization: it’s more about the way they look at it is more like the vendor lock-in.

I would say the best analogy is that you want to make sure the infrastructure you rely on is going to be able to absorb your activity but also be resilient enough. We still have some work because it’s definitely… and I understand the perspective of institutions to deploy on public infrastructure.

You know, at first when Wikipedia showed up—like, 20, 25 years ago, something like that. I remember I was at my engineering college. I was at the board and we were talking about having a wiki for doing some articles. And they were like, those very academic guys said, with a whole French accent, “This is unacceptable. Whenever I’m going to do this, anyone can put any information. It’s not trust.”

SPEAKER_01: To be clear, you are French. Yeah. You are allowed to.

SPEAKER_00: You’re allowed. And so… but they were very protecting this. And at that time I said, “Well, we cannot trust something that’s being built collectively like this.” But now we know you have to take a grain of salt, but it’s actually much more accepted, like reliable sources of information, and you can have things that are being built publicly that are actually very resilient.

SPEAKER_01: I mean, sorry, I was just gonna ask: there’s always this gap between what traditional institutions understand about… we all understand what’s been capable for a really, really long time. But are there still gaps, or do you think that’s been closed now? Is the baby grown up fully? Even if the capability is there, there’s still like a knowledge gap, I think, sometimes.

SPEAKER_00: Well, let me put it this way. There is about—if you combine all the different types of money—$123 trillion of cash around the world, right? $300 billion are on-chain, right? So the numbers talk for itself. We’re very early.

So there are people, they can… I think we still have a lot of work to do in terms of education. But by education, I mean really talking from a product perspective: what business problem I can solve for you; how it’s going to be done; what is going to be the maintenance after; how you’re going to deal with very specific use cases.

And so you can have some teams that already have an understanding of what you can achieve, but we still need to provide, I think as an ecosystem, more structure: who you can work with, the different vendors, what services they can do, where they can help, what’s the type of contract you’re going to have after, and really giving that overall perspective of a new entrant in the market.

Some of them understand very well and they have already pretty detailed questions, even asking me, “Reda, we need to increase the contract size from 24 to 40, 48 kilobytes.” And we have some… those Stack Overflow issues, well-known.

SPEAKER_03: So the stack depth limit was always a problem.

SPEAKER_00: And so there are some of them, it’s this. But then some other ones, in this more product, they’re going to ask me, “Okay, why should I go on an L2? What is the L1? What does it mean? And what about those chains? What are the primitives?” Explaining: well, if you build on any L2s, you’re actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way, but you can completely move your assets freely among all the ecosystem. The wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent, that you don’t have to rebuild.

And so those are things you need to explain. Some of them—maybe people—they’re going to say, “Well, what is this? This is just like some scammy…” I think you can find all the layers.

But now people also see the potential of what you can do with digital asset tokenization. And for people who are a little bit looking around, I’m very excited to see what’s going to happen in the next six to 12 months because the GENIUS Act was signed July 15 or something like this, and the CLARITY Act—I think it’s still a bit ongoing. So now we can also hear that there are really companies from either direction saying, “Okay, how are we going to implement this?”

The fintech is also moving. So the fact that they’re building their L1—even if they’re building the L1, I wish they would do some L2s, and my door will always be open when you want to consider that there is a pretty great tool that can help—but that’s going to push the market and financial institutions to really adopt this.

There is an organization like DTCC, the biggest clearinghouse in the world. All the securities in the world basically are being cleared over there. They released an incredible product like four months ago, in April, the “Great Collateral,” where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contracts that allows you to clear and to make some margin call and collateral management from different jurisdictions. Which is a fantastic use case.

I’m not a collateral management expert, but I understand the value, like how this unlocks. You actually have something that you can take from your bank in Japan that you’re going to post for something in the US because you have a market event. And this is something you would not even imagine before, and now you can do it, and it’s compliant. It’s actually legal. And then that can unlock so much efficiency. And so in the next 12 months, that’s going to be a huge game changer.

SPEAKER_01: So it sounds like the lid has been lifted off and there’s a ton of demand, but it’s like walking down the path to supply that demand. That’s the part that people are figuring out, right? Is that right?

SPEAKER_00: I think it’s such a very transformative technology for how those businesses operate. There is also: “How am I going to make money?”

SPEAKER_01: Okay. So there’s a fear element to it, right?

SPEAKER_00: It’s like, well now I can have like… yeah. I mean, I’m a PSP provider.

SPEAKER_03: Let me ask you this. So in the early days it felt like there was a focus on more back office use cases. Like, yeah, how do I move the collateral from my Japan regional branch to my, you know, whatever.

SPEAKER_02: Business process improvements.

SPEAKER_03: Business process improvements. And I felt that there eventually became—and I think this started like 2020, 2021—a shift for big corporations wanting top-line use cases. Like Nike was the first to sell a ton of NFTs. And then you’re seeing digital asset treasuries are a kind of genius way for a token to… the company doesn’t have to IPO, but there could be a token and there can be something that provides the traditional protections of equity that’s publicly traded. And then you could just leave this part sort of where it was, and somehow there’s kind of like a merger going on, and this is creating good top-line revenue for investment banks, etc., etc.

So is your sense that people want the efficiency to compete, or are they starting to think about it as a new revenue line, or transformed revenue line, or something?

SPEAKER_00: Well, that’s a billion, trillion-dollar question right there. I don’t have the answer. What I could say is I see how… I think if you look at operational optimization, it’s more than that. If capital flows more seamlessly, you make more money in a financial float. So the more you have a flow of your money easy, the more you’re going to be able to make some, because you’re going to unlock some capital improvements.

From conversations I’ve seen, we still don’t have the golden “do,” say, “Hey, that’s gonna remix a little bit of all the different people and intermediaries,” because if you suddenly have something that is being done in a much more efficient way, well some different intermediates might have to rethink the way of doing their business. This is not going to happen from one day to another.

What I can say is that because we’re going to have these new forms of working with digital assets, that’s going to be more like a golden era of opportunities to build pretty fantastic products. And the people that understand pretty well the ethos of the Ethereum ecosystem and also blockchain in general, and operations in traditional finance, and can bridge those two, you’re going to be able to bring amazing products.

And that’s what we see a little bit more with convergence. You know, Aave is doing a collateral product with Horizon and unlocking… you have figures, you have some… as we’re going to have now some assets that are on-chain that maybe you can loan, and you can collateralize, and you can borrow money, and you can have some liquidity in front of those assets while being the actual…

And also, I want to stress: we say RWAs, RWAs, RWAs. There is a lot of… we probably need to find some new language because…

SPEAKER_01: You know how I feel about that. I think the RWA term is so broad.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this can be RWA. And I can also take a picture of my bank account and say, “Hey, this is tokenization of my bank account.” And so there is RWAs, but most of them, they’re actually kind of elaborate IOUs. And now we’re moving towards more and more having some standards and things like… it’s the legal tent.

SPEAKER_03: Like, yeah, you want the native issue.

SPEAKER_00: The token is the…

SPEAKER_02: Is the…

SPEAKER_00: Is the legal claim to the assets.

SPEAKER_01: Yes.

SPEAKER_00: And that’s when this happens. And when focusing on that, that’s going to unlock some pretty incredible things, because then you connect this with DeFi, maybe. You’re always going to need some form of AML/KYC and everything. Like, the DeFi… there’s none for the last year. They’re probably going to have like two of those, but once you connect this, I think that’s going to be pretty incredible.

SPEAKER_01: But how do the institutions feel about… obviously as the head of the EEA, and you feel strongly about Ethereum too, right? Like the Ethereum ecosystem broadly, of L1. How do they feel about that? Do they see any other…

We know Ripple has tried to attract that interest for a really long time. Are they kind of sold on Ethereum at this point, or are they still kind of needing to be convinced?

SPEAKER_00: I’ve heard several executives at presentations saying, “Ethereum is the standard. EVM is the standard.” This is the ecosystem.

Having said that, and as you know, decision makers also want to make sure they keep the door open and not be locked. So they move progressively. You know, 60% of the stablecoin issuance is on Ethereum. I think probably 85 to 90% of all RWA—similar statistics. About DeFi activities, Electric Capital: you can see the graph—three times more than any other ecosystem in terms of builders and everything. So that’s the most radiant and advanced ecosystem in terms of research on every facet. They recognize that.

But it doesn’t mean that we don’t need to keep educating, to keep working with the EF—for instance, they’ve been doing incredible work for the last few months—really packaging the message in a better way that can be more digestible. But there’s more work: the protocol teams are already addressing so many of the fears that different digital asset managers in financial institutions can have. But how we bring that message to the right people, package it in a way that it’s easy to understand—that’s some of the work that is being done as we speak. And that’s going to really help continuing to solidify that dominance position.

But to also answer your question: some institutions say, “Hey, we want to be multi-chain. We want to look at everything,” which I think is absolutely fair, and I would do the same if I were in their shoes. So they have some different assessment criteria and they say, “Well, we’re going to take this chain, this chain, this chain, this chain, and then we’ll see.”

SPEAKER_02: I mean, go back to beyond EVM. You’ve obviously got competition between Ethereum and other EVM flavors. What is the competition outside of that? Because you’ve obviously got competition within that, but…

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: What do you hear?

SPEAKER_02: Institutions doing non-EVM things as well.

SPEAKER_03: Like Canton is around. I don’t know what they’re using. Do institutions use Solana at all? Well, I know, but does R3 still have its own big proprietary-ish stack? Hedera? What do you hear?

SPEAKER_00: Okay. Canton is probably the one most advanced in terms of connection with the traditional finance ecosystem. They have a way it’s structured though. It’s something I still don’t completely understand. You can be a validator, have some tokens that they’re going to exchange on some private market, and some form of revenue. And then they have that… it’s a consortium. It’s a Quorum v2, I would say. And they’ve been able to bring it into their governance: a lot of different financial institutions.

But once again, and if you ask me—I’m biased of course—but this is an ecosystem. Yes, the Canton code is open source and everything, but you’re still building on a technology that is not super… there’s not a lot of people. When you’re going to be the CIO of a company and you need to have maintenance or something, it’s going to be what—20 guys in a country that can work on this? And so that’s the way I look at this.

But Solana, I’m not sure with the institutions.

SPEAKER_03: I don’t hear anything institutional from Solana, but it seems popular nonetheless.

SPEAKER_01: Oddly enough, Ripple has been trying to do this for a long time, but I don’t hear them brought up in the conversation that much.

SPEAKER_02: Nobody ever used Ripple.

SPEAKER_00: I’ve been in blockchain not as long as you guys, but really since 2019. And I spent almost four years at ChainSafe—very authentic builders, crypto-native protocol development. I’ve been to conferences with engineers, and I asked them in a very candid way: “Have you ever built on Ripple, or on some of their…” And I had conversations with engineers at ChainSafe, and we had some polls and we had some conversations in the Slack, I remember, and no one really came up with some very strong…

SPEAKER_02: They’ve just got an infinite war chest for marketing. Well, and lobbying.

SPEAKER_01: I mean, at one point, one of the Sibos’s I went to years and years ago, Ripple was supposed to have a huge booth. And I guess SWIFT decided, “Oh, they’re too much of a competitor,” so they kicked them out. And this wasn’t…

SPEAKER_03: They were calling themselves the “SWIFT killer.”

SPEAKER_01: Right. For a while, Ripple decided, “You know what, we’re just going to run our own conference in parallel with Sibos.” They put a parallel conference, and Vitalik was speaking at their conference. And I remember they had buses in from the Sibos conference, taking you to where their conference was. And I remember seeing Vitalik run across, looking for this conference, because it was in this new place, and we were all trying to… I remember waving him over. So it’s… Corda people still using Corda, right?

SPEAKER_00: Like it’s been bought out by Selena. Corda is Selena now.

SPEAKER_02: I don’t think… I don’t think they would approach it in those terms. I think it’s a partnership and a collaboration.

SPEAKER_01: Yes.

SPEAKER_00: That we’re not…

SPEAKER_02: Absolutely. Absolutely. They weren’t bought by…

SPEAKER_01: Not part of… but yes. But I mean, I…

SPEAKER_02: I will say: we are using Fabric still.

SPEAKER_00: Well yes, behind the scene, Fabric is still very present. I think central banks, and those types of more very closed environments… I’m not sure BIS—we know Bank for International Settlements, which is for those who don’t know, it’s like 40 different international banks that work together to optimize collaboration and exchange. But they had a project, Agora, that they started a couple of months ago. Those are institutions where it takes much longer time.

SPEAKER_02: I think they’re starting a new project.

SPEAKER_00: That’s not the same Agora, but I would imagine they were having some POCs before. I know a few central banks, they run using Fabric, you know…

SPEAKER_02: You know, it’s probably like the asbestos, isn’t it? It’s just going to take years to work that out.

SPEAKER_01: You need people in suits to like… I will say, I think we’re almost at 45 minutes. Reda’s been very generous with his time. Do you have any final thoughts that you want to share?

SPEAKER_00: Actually, on Fabric, I know IBM is working on a bridge between Fabric to… it’s called FabricX… to Ethereum. You can see that online, right?

SPEAKER_02: Okay. Well, one of that big “sell” at New York Blockchain Week in 2018 was there was that EVM integration, right, that they did.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, they did a channel or something.

SPEAKER_02: It was “Appreciate JS” or whatever. They did do this munching together, and that was using Burrow, right? Because you’ve got Burrow from before Besu, and that was the continuation of that: ErisDB, Monax. That was never mainnet compatible though. But there was that go-ethereum EVM within Hyperledger under the same licensing, so they could wham those together. And I mean, that’s seven years ago. So yeah, I’m sure that they need to have an even better EVM story these days.

SPEAKER_00: So to answer your question: EVM and Ethereum is really the standard, as everyone—that’s what they’re saying. You go through different stages: you have the Chief Innovation Officer of SWIFT and some different institutions, they understand that.

That’s what they say. Everywhere I went, on all those different panels, you know, we had a panel at 8:30 on permissionless versus private networks. It was hosted by Applied Blockchain, a member of the EEA. There was Citibank, Linux Foundation, Decentralized Trust, Ubyx, and me. And it was full. There were people standing up. And there was the SWIFT Innovation Officer, some other banks that came to talk to us.

So people understand Ethereum is definitely seen as the standard and the place where you want to build, because that’s where you have access to the most liquidity, the most users, the most vibrant DeFi ecosystem, which is something that is getting closer. They think, “Well, maybe there is some way to make money here. I don’t know exactly how, but there is some potential.”

So I think the future is very bright for us.

SPEAKER_02: Ties very nicely back to the start of the conversation, and about the thoughts for the EEA and so on. Something that Jeremy Millar said in the opening speech on the opening day was: think of this as being like a router, an internet/intranet. There’s no reason why suitably modular code bases shouldn’t serve all of these use cases, public and private.

And what we did not want to happen—and I remember being driven very much by this—was saying: let’s not have arbitrarily different code bases for these different things, because we can’t be asked. Having that conversation and making the effort to try and bridge those worlds: that was really coming from that Fabric and Corda competition, of these big enterprises basically being told, “You Ethereum guys have got to get your stuff together or we’re going to get mandated to use this other stuff. And it doesn’t matter what you want, it’s like the spending will have been spent and it’s never coming back.”

So to my mind, it’s really superb to see where we are. That was kind of the goal: this can be a standard for everything. And yeah, things were immature, and maybe you needed to be doing consortium chains and you needed to take these baby steps on the way and wait for the tech to catch up. But really, it’s like this can be the answer for everything.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and I think that’s where we are.

SPEAKER_00: We are, and we’re talking more and more. The Ethereum Foundation has done an incredible job. They have an enterprise team also, they’re having conversations with everyone, and they have access to all the different leaders. And this has been pretty fantastic.

So the more we discuss about this and say, “Hey, there is no CEO of Ethereum. It’s not a private company. There is no CEO of the internet. They all use Linux,” right? That’s something that is catching up more and more.

And that’s also the mission at what we do at the EEA: going to have this conversation, or doing events, bringing people together. A few events that we do, we try to really mix DeFi, traditional finance institutions, pure Ethereum players, and have all those people talking together. That’s how we make that moving forward.

SPEAKER_01: Well, on that note, I think we’ll wrap up. Where can people find more about you and EEA?

SPEAKER_00: The website: we are present on all the social media. The website is entethalliance.org. We have the same handle on Twitter, on LinkedIn. I’m also on LinkedIn and Twitter and try to post often some articles and insights. And there’s some more work that I’m going to put together in a couple of weeks around RWAs and everything.

And also always looking for some large institutions that would like to collaborate on some writing pieces, so we can really put some thought leadership and help explain what’s being done. And I think bridging the Ethereum world with traditional finance is something that we’re pretty excited to do in a couple of weeks.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that’s awesome.

SPEAKER_00: We’ll be also in Singapore FinTech Week next month, in Devcon in Argentina, and we’ll be also in Abu Dhabi for Finance Week.

SPEAKER_01: Cool. And Bob, where can people find you?

SPEAKER_02: So yeah, I’m on Twitter. Same as my name: Bob Summerwill, with a W-I-L-L, not “Vil,” not “Tom-O-Will.”

SPEAKER_01: Not the German spelling. Karen K.

SPEAKER_03: James Lubin on X, YouTube, etc.

SPEAKER_01: You can find me on X at vicvic4wong. Thank you for joining us for our first in-person roundtable. Thanks again. That’s awesome. Thanks for coming. Take care.

SPEAKER_00: That was pretty cool to be in Bushwick again.
