SPEAKER_04: I use Restream. We try to use something and it streams on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time. So we’re using StreamYard too. We’re using StreamYard and I’m just double checking. We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit… not all perfect, yeah. Yeah. I’ll share the one. I don’t know if you’ve tried this one, but this one is pretty cool. Pretty great. Because you’re thinking, there must be good software for this, right? It’s such a common need. Isn’t there just an answer that just works?

But the thing is, those platforms, they’re not built with interoperability in mind. They don’t like it. They want to lock you in. Yeah, exactly. X especially. So that’s against our vision. On X, there isn’t even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah, it’s… why would you want to download it? You know, I guess the next step is maybe like… you want to use it somewhere else? You want to be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms. Even own a query, or just access, you know.

Something I love about Google is like I can go, I can activate the tracking, you know, but at least I can go in and say, what did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have like thousands of data, but they don’t even share it with you. Yeah, exactly. I find it quite… quite wild.

SPEAKER_03: 501. Oh, yeah. We are live. So we are live. No, no, no, I’m ready. No, but that was a good cold intro, right?

So we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for Janjoo Live in real life, in the same room. In the same room. So we’re amazing. And you are a special guest, do you want to intro? Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Redwan Meslen. Yes, exactly. Meslen, who is the executive director of the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years. The healthy run. Yes, exactly.

So, yeah. It’s eight years now. Since 2017, yeah. February 2017 was the launch date, on the 28th. There was pre-work solidly before, at least three months, maybe more. There were meetings I was part of in December and January. I mean, those were the first big meetings, you know, with whatever, 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, it really started probably at Devcon 2, really. It did? Yeah. So that was Shanghai, October. There was the kickoff meeting at the JPMorgan office, which was pretty big. There were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft. Right. So that public launch was February. It was February. But December, there was an internal one, and then JPMorgan…

SPEAKER_03: …was in January of 2017. But yeah, a lot of those initial contacts happened at Devcon 2 in October the previous year. Well, in the Devcon 2… Oh, yes. Yeah, so basically, there was a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And yeah, the group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at like a Starbucks just off-site. And that was sort of the idea-formation thing about the…

And then Matt Spoke of Nuco held a little bar-side event as well, which… do we have some technical issues? I don’t know. Oh, okay. Hold on a second. We have a technical issue, everybody. I will fix that. Oh, did I? I messed up the Twitter. You did a bad one. I did a bad one. So everyone, please join us on YouTube. Space is at 5 a.m.

Right. Matt Spoke held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to, and there were various others there. I don’t know if you went to that one as well. I didn’t go to that one.

So I think the main thing was that, yeah, I’m going to try and fix this right now on Twitter. Live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now. If not, I am…

SPEAKER_01: I did choose a parallel in that because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time. There was an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise stuff. So at some point he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique.

So that was not quite the same group. It was a larger group that’s slightly different. Nuco was part of that. Luca was part of that.

Also, by the way, we should introduce ourselves. Yeah, I’m Bob Summerwill. So I’m head of ecosystem at…

SPEAKER_02: …STRATO. I’m the CEO of BlockApps, creators of STRATO.

SPEAKER_03: And Victor Wong, chief product officer of BlockApps.

SPEAKER_02: So sorry, but yeah. Amos as well. Do you remember Amos? Oh yeah. We should check in. I haven’t thought about Amos in several years until this moment. So the interesting thing about what they were doing, so that was like some Taiwan bank consortium thing. Yep.

SPEAKER_01: But then they did work on Chinese cryptography and stuff. They’ve got differing requirements, right? And Masterchain, which was in Russia, that was like a Sberbank thing.

SPEAKER_04: Because you have, you know, I was not there at that time. And so it’s very interesting for me to know: what were the hopes and really excitement that you see? You were part of those early conversations. This was, right, I think companies… it was a pretty big event, you know? Yeah, as you mentioned, like JPMorgan and everything, all those big names coming into the ecosystem.

SPEAKER_01: And what were the hopes and really the overall atmosphere when the EEA was created, like eight years ago?

Yeah, well, I mean, ConsenSys were very critical as well. Because they were doing a load of the enterprise engagement stuff, right? They had many, many companies starting to get interested in, hey, you know, we want to do a pilot, we want to get involved. So ConsenSys were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together.

But yeah, over those months, you really have a hell of a lot of momentum, really, really quick. The observation during Devcon 2 when the idea was hatched was basically that…

SPEAKER_02: …at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had hacked their own consensus algorithms and security. Many guests, many guests. Indeed.

We learned later that JP Morgan’s Quorum was initially built by Jeff Wilcke. He had some kind of… and that was not announced at the time of Devcon 2. That was still behind the scenes for a few months, but happened just before the EEA started. But yeah, you’ve got all of this stuff brewing up, I mean, for years earlier.

Like, if you think of ErisDB that became Monax, that became Hyperledger Burrow. So that was a permissioned Ethereum client off PoC5, pre-mainnet, mid-2014, of sticking in Tendermint onto an EVM. So yeah, it was all a bit smooshed apart.

SPEAKER_02: But it was like, the time is right for us to work together because we’ve all got the same needs. Us too. We had our own client and it got used in a bunch of the ConsenSys consulting engagements at that time. And we started even then kind of tuning it for enterprise. And so I guess the idea was like, well, maybe enterprises won’t adopt if there isn’t a standard for all of this new stuff that they need that’s above and beyond the base standard.

SPEAKER_03: Well, I think clients… I think it was even beyond that. There was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company’s silo to get, I think, Ethereum to do what they wanted to do in a private way. So everyone was holding on these things. And what came out of those early conversations at Devcon was, wait, while we’re doing similar things, maybe if we all kind of work together, we could do it faster and get this up faster. And that was all around private Ethereum. And I guess also like a marriage between…

SPEAKER_01: …customers of these things and builders. Of saying: you’ve got all these kind of startup companies that are making Ethereum things, and you’ve obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this. But on that standardization side, there was nothing. And it’s like, you’re all going to get vendor-locked instantly and it’ll all just be arbitrarily different and painful and horrible. So let’s try and work out.

Because at some point as well with Quorum it was kind of like, you know, are we going to collaboratively do codebases as well? Hyperledger was another piece into this. A few months earlier, I spent a bunch of time working on C++ relicensing the C++ client to get back to Apache 2.0 so it could have been contributed into Hyperledger and we could have gathered around that. That fucked up. So the EEA was kind of a backup, I guess, of like, right, we can’t have this grand fusion, but there’s enough happening on the Ethereum side that we can at least get all the Ethereum pieces together.

And then, yeah, I guess it went quite quickly from, okay, we don’t want to straight compete with Hyperledger…

SPEAKER_02: …having a shared codebase also kind of screws up the companies.

So I think, let me, you know, in the spirit of spiciness: I think the enterprise users would have preferred a shared codebase, and they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor-locked again. They’ve had these horrific IBM nightmares, Oracle nightmares over the years, and they’re just like, not this time. We’re not going to live through this.

I mean, also, you have got that market pressure, right, of Corda coming out, of IBM launching Fabric. They were worried it would end up that kind of…

SPEAKER_01: Those were nominally open source, but quite proprietary. So those were both shooting for release in February 2017. So it’s that kind of timeline: right, we’ve got to get our shit together to be able to do an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM, R3.

At that time, I remember one of our prominent enterprise-user EEA members said, you know, yeah, they’ve got a call with 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks, let’s say, right?

And it’s funny that Ethereum just survived all of this, more or less not paying any attention, and the competition kind of came and went.

SPEAKER_03: Well, I think there was another parallel thing that was happening at that Devcon. Those were like the first enterprise use cases we talk about today. Like for example, Santander talked about US dollars on-chain, which we all recognize as a stablecoin now.

But you see, Victor, I think that’s a very cool parallel. You’ve set the stage pretty well for where it’s coming from.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And where it started, you mentioned innovation labs starting to contribute to some code. We’ve known the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it’s only actually now—and it’s been for probably the last year—that things have been really changing drastically.

And to take your words, when you say innovation labs: it’s not innovation labs anymore looking at how they implement blockchain in their ecosystem. It’s really an executive team that says, hey, we want to plan what is the production, like how we get it to market. Thankfully, they’re scared now. So they better move. I don’t know if it’s like…

But there was some interesting talk when we were at Sibos, like the SWIFT conference. Yeah, we should mention that because…

SPEAKER_03: You were just at Sibos and you’re dealing with what we think of as TradFi institutional players, and that’s where you have a lot of communication. So what were your impressions about where they’re at with that? Because that’s the other side that we talk about. The digital asset tokenization is definitely a hot topic. Everyone is looking because they know it’s happening, they want to be involved. And now especially, there is less regulatory…

The listeners may not know what Sibos is. Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_04: So Sibos is the big SWIFT conference. SWIFT, if you’re not familiar, is a messaging system that a lot of—11,000—financial institutions around the world use. It’s actually a co-op. It’s a DAO for TradFi.

SPEAKER_02: Kudos to Danielle from ConsenSys who said that to me once. It is a DAO. Although it’s like, can we buy in now? I feel like… you know, the token is having probably a bank license.

The London Metal Exchange is like this too. It’s like you want to sign up, you got to buy a bunch of shares and then there’s an annual fee and whatnot. And you have to put someone there all the time. You have to join the trade guild.

SPEAKER_04: Yes, exactly. And so that big conference is a big meetup of payments, I would say, every year. So you have all the big financial institutions, also global financial institutions like clearing houses, settlements, like Euroclear, etc. But also all the banks. And they gather and there is a lot of conversation.

What is very interesting is actually Sibos and SWIFT is a very standard organization. Because what they do is: how we make sure we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. And so they used to have a different kind of messaging format, and recently now they’re migrating to something new, which is ISO 20022. Which is, if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really how every financial institution wants to communicate. They’ve been working on that spec for a long time, and that’s how anything that can touch finance, from securities to payments, has to be codified.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it’s good to explain. So most of finance gets cleared through messaging. And crypto people are used to putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere. It’s not really like this.

SPEAKER_04: Oh yes. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, indeed. That’s a very key point. The process of what we call delivery versus payment in traditional finance—DvP—it’s a pretty complex thing. Because how do you make sure: when you deliver the money, the money has been received; that you receive the asset; that everything has been… you know.

And it’s a lot of dance because you receive a message, you send another one. And it’s not like how we do in crypto, where we submit and it’s actually an atomic transaction, which is like just one thing. And when the transaction is complete, you know it’s been executed, it’s been delivered, and all the parties—actually, you know, I give you the cash, I know you’ve been giving me the money exactly.

Where actually there is like a little bit of dance: I put the cash here, you see the cash that has been moving here, you send the money. And so the blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things like T+1 or T+2 for some of those different exchanges—now you do it, well depending on what chain you’re going to deploy—between a second to even less than that.

And also SWIFT…

SPEAKER_02: …isn’t a payments mechanism, right? No, it’s a message.

That’s another comment. So let me interject with a specific example. I think they’re biggest in FX, right? Yes. So let’s say I’ve got some USD, I want some euro. And we kind of agree to a USD/EUR trade. And so we look up whatever the pair is trading at.

And I think it’s like: I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to SWIFT, and you do too. And then SWIFT checks if it matches. It charges $7 either way. If it does match, then it’ll tell us that it matched. Well, I don’t think it’s actually exactly this way.

SPEAKER_04: It’s more: SWIFT offers a type of envelope, and a format of envelope and paper and ink that we know how to use, and how we’re supposed to fill up some forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants. It’s not moving the asset.

It’s like: I have the USD on my bank list, you’ve got the euro on your bank list, talking to each other in a secure and compliant way. Because it’s also, “oh, he sent that,” you have to send some specific messaging for compliance. Then I send another one, say, “hey, I checked, there’s all the information.” A bunch of local jurisdiction-specific…

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it’s like a lot of different handshakes. I think the way someone described it to me… it’s like a funny TCP handshake. It’s sort of like what they’re doing is tracking the transfers, but no money is actually moving, and then they have a list of IOUs.

So like, when I send a SWIFT transaction from… let’s say I send $100 to you in France, and I go to my bank, I put in $100, the money doesn’t go anywhere. I have to write USD off my ledger.

SPEAKER_04: The net at the end of the day is what they call RTGS. They’re going to do the transfer actually. It’s like a different messaging. If you research—and I’m not a SWIFT expert, but I had to learn over the last couple of months. I’ve done a little bit more deep dive—and it’s fascinating because there is such a huge dance between two transfers of money.

Because you have the money in your bank account, but then you actually use central bank money, then you have the deposit money. So like those, what you call M0, M1, M2. And so all of that is pretty complex.

And then we’re just talking about payments here, you know, not talking about securities or those other financial instruments that you can exchange also using blockchain in a very efficient way.

But that’s, you know, using stablecoins, you can make everything super simple. And also one misconception maybe I would love to mention is: we talk about stablecoins and CBDCs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They’re actually exactly the same thing, but just in a different context. A CBDC is a stablecoin for a central bank. It’s just the issuer. The issuer is not the same. We’re never going to really touch CBDCs because this is like the money of banks, if you say. But almost, I think, from a technical level, it’s almost like a copy-paste of the same contract, the same mechanism. But we create a whole different language and terminology for that, but they’re actually very similar.

And funny fact: those CBDCs, they’ve been doing… you know, like the baby needed to grow. You know, like you said, Devcon 2, it was a two-year-old kid, Ethereum. And we were like, “hey, come in here, you can manage the most critical infrastructure of the planet,” which is our money and how we do trade. And you can do all of this.

And I think like the Ethereum Foundation, I have to give them credit. For a long time they were saying, “hey guys, you’re not considering the enterprise,” and everything. But I think they did the right thing because they protected that baby so it could grow.

And now we are at an age of: it’s more mature. It’s more than 10 years. It’s still not even a teenager. The analogy with humans is going to take some limits. But we are at a point now where we have a technology, and Ethereum really has the capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing the financial institutions, which is scalability, privacy, composability, and interoperability. The four points that you had in the ARC paper from Circle. And now we have this.

Just last week, zkSync announced up to 15,000 TPS. And there is a new thing that almost every week is going on. We now have a technology when it looks at: well, I need to make sure this is private. I need to make sure this is going to be executed in a seamless way. Also decentralization—it’s more about the way they look at it. It’s more like the vendor lock-in.

I would say the best analogy is: you want to make sure the infrastructure you rely on is going to be able to absorb your activity, but also be resilient enough. This, we still have some work. Because it definitely… and I understand the perspective of institutions to deploy on a public infrastructure.

You know, at first when Wikipedia showed up, like, you know, 20, 25 years ago, something like that, I think. I mean, I remember I was in my engineering college. It was on the board and we were talking about having a wiki for doing some articles. And they were like those very academic guys: “This is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. Anyone can put any information. This is not trustworthy.”

To be clear, you are allowed to. Yeah, you’re allowed to. And so—but they were in French. They were very like, you know, protecting this. And at that time, I said, well, we cannot trust something that’s being built collectively like this. But now we know you have to take a grain of salt, but it’s actually much more accepted. Those are reliable sources of information, and you can have things that are being built publicly that are actually very resilient.

SPEAKER_03: Sorry, I was just going to ask: there’s always this gap between what traditional institutions understand about… We all understand what’s been capable for a really, really long time. But are there still gaps, or do you think that’s been closed now? It’s maybe grown up fully, but even when the capability is there, there’s still…

SPEAKER_04: A knowledge gap, I think, sometimes.

Well, let me put it this way. There is about, if you combine all the different types of money, $123 trillion of cash around the world, right? $300 billion are on-chain, right? So the numbers talk for themselves. We’re very early.

So there are people—they can… I think we still have a lot of work to do in terms of education. But by education, I mean really talking from a product perspective: what business problem I can solve for you, how it’s going to be done, what is going to be the maintenance after, how you’re going to deal with very specific use cases.

And so you can have some teams that already have an understanding of what you can achieve, but we still need to provide, I think as an ecosystem, more structure: who you can work with, the different vendors, what services they can do, where they can help, what’s the type of contract you’re going to have after, and really giving that overall perspective of a new entrant in the market.

And so some of them, they understand very well, and they have already some pretty detailed questions, even asking me, “Redwan, we need to increase the contract size from 24 to 40, 48 kilobytes,” and we have some, you know, those Stack Overflow issues, like well-known. Yeah, the stack depth one that was always a problem.

So some of them it’s this, but then some other ones in a small product, they’re going to ask me, “Okay, why should I go on an L2? What is the L1? What does it mean?” And what about those changes? What are the primitives? Explaining like, well, if you build any L2s, you’re actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way. But you can completely move your assets freely among all the ecosystem. The wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent that you don’t have to rebuild.

And so those are things you need to explain. Some other people, they’re going to say, “Well, what is this? This is just scammy,” or something like that. I think you can find all the layers. But now people also see the potential of what you can do with digital assets, tokenization.

And for people who are a little bit looking around, I’m very excited to see what’s going to happen in the next six to 12 months because, you know, the GENIUS Act was signed in July, or something like this. I think it’s still a bit ongoing. Yeah. So now we…

And we can also hear that there are really companies from every direction saying, “Okay, how are we going to implement this?” The fintech is also moving. So the fact that they’re building their L1—even if they’re building the L1—I wish they would do some L2s. And my door will always be open when you want to consider that there is a pretty great tool that can help. But that’s going to push the market, from financial institutions to really adopting this.

There is an organization like DTCC, you know, the biggest clearing house in the world. Like all the securities in the world basically are being cleared over there. They released an incredible product like four months ago in April, like the “Great Collateral,” where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contracts that allows you to clear and to make some margin call and collateral management from different jurisdictions. Which is a fantastic use case when you see…

I’m not a collateral management expert, but I understand the value of how this unlocks. You actually have something that you can take from your bank in Japan that you’re going to post for something in the U.S. because you have a market event. And this is something you would not even imagine before, and now you can do it. And it’s compliant. It’s actually legal. And that can unlock so much efficiencies.

SPEAKER_03: And so that’s in the next few months—that’s going to be a huge game changer.

So it sounds like the lid has been lifted off and there’s a ton of demand, but it’s like walking down the path to supply that demand. That’s the part that people are figuring out, right? Is that right?

SPEAKER_02: So there’s a fear element to it, right? It’s like, well, now I can have… I’m a PSP provider.

Let me ask you this. So in the early days, it felt like there was a focus on more like back-office use cases. Like, yeah, how do I move the collateral from my Japan regional branch to my… you know. Business process improvements. Business process improvements.

And I felt that there eventually became—I think this started like 2020, 2021—a shift for big corporations wanting top-line use cases. Like Nike was the first to sell a ton of NFTs. And then you’re seeing like—I think like the digital asset treasuries are a kind of genius way for a token to… like the company doesn’t have to IPO, but there could be a token and there can be something that provides the traditional protections of equity that’s publicly traded. And then you could just leave this part sort of where it was, and somehow there’s kind of like a merger going on. And, you know, this is creating good top-line revenue for investment banks, etc., etc.

So is your sense that people want the efficiency to compete, or are they starting to think about it as a new revenue line, or a transformed revenue line, or something?

SPEAKER_04: Well, that’s a billion, trillion dollar question right there. I don’t have the answer.

What I could say is I see how… I think if you look at operational optimization, it’s more than that. If capital flows more seamlessly, you make more money in a financial flow. So the more you have a flow of your money easy, the more you’re going to be able to make some because you’re going to unlock some opportunities, some capital improvements.

I think from conversation I’ve seen, they still don’t have the golden “do,” say, “hey, that’s going to…” It’s a remix of all the different people and intermediaries and people working. Because if you suddenly have something that is being done in a much more efficient way, well, some different intermediates might have to rethink the way of doing their business. This is not going to happen from one day to another.

What I can say is that because we’re going to have those new forms of working with digital assets, that’s going to be more like a golden era for opportunities to build pretty fantastic products. And the people that understand pretty well the ethos of the Ethereum ecosystem, and also blockchain in general, and how operations in traditional finance work, and can bridge those two, you’re going to be able to bring amazing products.

And that’s what we see a little bit more with convergence. You know, Aave doing a collateral product with Horizon, and… you have like figures… you have some of: how as we’re going to have now some assets that are on-chain, that maybe you can loan, and you can collateralize, and you can borrow money, and you can have liquidity in front of those assets while being the action.

And also, I want to stress: we say RWAs, RWAs, RWAs. There is a lot of… we need probably to find some new language. Because there is…

SPEAKER_03: You know how I feel about that. I think the RWA term is so broad.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we need… this can be an RWA. Yeah, exactly. And I can also take a picture of my bank account and say, “Hey, this is a tokenization of my bank account.” And so there is all the ways. But most of them, they actually kind of elaborate IOUs.

And now we’re moving towards more and more having some standards. And things like: it’s the legal tent. You want the native issue. The token is the legal claim to the asset. When this happens, and when focusing on that, that’s going to unlock some pretty incredible things.

You connect this with DeFi, you’re going to always need some form of AML, KYC, and everything. Like the DeFi… for the last year, it’s… they’re probably going to have like two of those. But once you connect this, I think that’s going to be pretty incredible.

But how do the institutions feel about… obviously as the head of the EEA, and you feel strongly about Ethereum, right? Like the Ethereum ecosystem broadly, of L1s, L2s. How do they feel about that? Do they see any other… you know, like we know that Ripple has tried to attract that interest for a really long time. Are they kind of sold on Ethereum at this point, or are they still needing to be convinced?

SPEAKER_04: I’ve heard several executives at Sibos saying, “Ethereum is the standard. EVM is the standard. This is the ecosystem.”

Having said that, and as decision makers, they also want to make sure they keep the door open and not being locked. So they move progressively.

You know, 60% of the stablecoin issuance is on Ethereum. I think probably 85% to 90% of all RWAs, it’s the same. Similar statistics about DeFi activities. That’s, you know, Electric Capital, like you can see a graph, like three times more than any other ecosystem in terms of builders and everything. So that’s the most vibrant and advanced ecosystem in terms of research on every facet. And so they know, they recognize.

But it doesn’t mean that we don’t need to keep educating, to keep working with the Ethereum Foundation. For instance, they’ve been doing incredible work for the last few months of really packaging the message in a better way that can be more digestible. But there’s more work.

For instance, the protocol team—they’re already addressing so many of the fears that a digital asset manager in a financial institution can have. But how we bring that message to the right people, package it in a way that it’s easy to understand, that’s some of the work that is being done as we speak. And that’s going to really help continuing solidifying that dominance position.

But to also answer your question, some of those institutions, they say, “Hey, we want to be multi-chain. We want to look at everything,” which I think is absolutely fair. I would do the same if I were in their shoes. So, okay, they have some different assessment criteria. And they say, “Wow, we’re going to take this chain, this chain, this chain, this chain, and then we’ll see.”

I mean, beyond EVM, you’ve obviously got competition between Ethereum and other EVM flavors.

SPEAKER_01: What is the competition outside of that? Because I know you’ve obviously got competition within that. But are institutions doing non-EVM things as well? There’s like Canton around. I don’t know what they’re using. Do institutions use Solana at all?

Well, I know, but does R3 still have its own big proprietary-ish stack?

SPEAKER_04: It’s not proprietary anymore, but it’s… yeah.

Well, Hedera. No one using Hedera.

What are you… competitive. Canton is probably the one the most advanced in terms of connection with the traditional finance world. They have a way it’s structured though. It’s something I still don’t completely understand. You can be a validator, have some tokens that you can exchange on some private market, and so some form of revenue. And then they have already like that. It’s a consortium, like a Quorum v2, I would say. And they’ve been able to bring into their governance a lot of different financial institutions.

But then once again, and if you ask me—and I’m biased, of course—this is an ecosystem. Canton code is open source and everything. But you’re still building on a technology that is not super… there are not a lot of people. When are you going to be the CIO of a company and you need to have some maintenance or something? It’s going to be, what, like 20 guys in a country that can do some work on this? And so that’s the way I look at this.

SPEAKER_03: But I think Solana… I’m not sure with the institutions. I don’t hear anything institutional from Solana, but it seems popular nonetheless.

Oddly enough, Ripple has been trying to do this for a really long time, but I don’t hear them brought up in the conversation that much.

SPEAKER_01: Nobody ever used Ripple.

SPEAKER_04: I’ve been in blockchain not as long as you guys, but really since 2019. And I spent almost four years at ChainSafe. Very authentic builders, crypto-native protocol development.

And I’ve been to conferences with the engineers, and I asked them in a very candid way, “Have you ever built on Ripple?” or on some other? And I had conversations with the engineers at ChainSafe. We had some polls and some conversation in the Slack, I remember, and no one really came up with some very… It just got an infinite war chest for marketing and lobbying.

I mean, at one point, one of the Sibos I went to years and years ago, Ripple was supposed to have a huge booth. And I guess SWIFT decided, oh, they’re too much of a competitor, so they kicked them out. They were calling themselves the “SWIFT killer.”

So Ripple decided, you know what? We’re just going to run our own conference in parallel with Sibos. They put on a parallel conference. And Vitalik was speaking at their conference.

SPEAKER_03: At the Ripple one?

SPEAKER_04: At the Ripple one. And I remember they had buses in front of the Sibos conference taking you to where their new conference was. And I remember seeing Vitalik run across, looking for this conference because it was in this new place and we were all trying to… I remember waving him, like, “Over here, Vitalik.” So it’s, you know.

SPEAKER_01: People still using Corda? Anyone using Fabric still?

SPEAKER_04: Well, yes. Behind the scenes, Fabric is still very present in, I think, central banks and those type of more very closed environments. Even, I’m not sure, BIS, Bank of International Settlement—which is, for those who don’t know, it’s like 40 different international banks that work together to optimize, I would say, the collaboration and exchange. But they had a Project Agora that they started a couple of months ago.

Those are institutions where it takes much longer time, I think, to dance into new projects. That’s not the same Agora, but I would imagine maybe they were having some POCs before.

I know some few central banks, they run using Fabric. You know, like…

SPEAKER_03: It’s probably like the asbestos, isn’t it? It’s just going to take years to sort of check out. You need people in suits to support us.

I will say, I think we’re almost at 45 minutes. Redwan’s been very generous with his time. I think we ask him…

SPEAKER_01: Do you have any final thoughts you want to share?

Actually, on Fabric, I know IBM is working on a bridge between Fabric to Ethereum. It’s called Fabric X. So you can see that online.

Right. Well, one of their big sell at New York Blockchain Week in 2018 was their EVM integration. They did the… yeah, they did a channel or something, about Web3.js or whatever, that they did do this mashing together. And that was using Burrow, right? Because you’ve got the Burrow.

Burrow went into Hyperledger. For Besu… and that was the continuation of that ErisDB/Monax thing. That was never mainnet compatible though. But there was that Go EVM within Hyperledger under the same licensing, so they could wham those together.

And I mean, that’s seven years ago. So yeah, I’m sure that they need to have an even better EVM story these days.

SPEAKER_04: To answer your question: EVM and Ethereum is really the standard, as everyone, that’s what they’re saying. You go through some different stages. You have the chief innovation officer of SWIFT and some different institutions, they understand that. That’s what they say.

You know, I was really… everywhere I went on all those different panels, we had a panel at 8:30 on permissionless, very private networks. It was hosted by Applied Blockchain, a member of the EEA. There was Citibank, Linux Foundation, Decentralized Trust, Ubyx, and me. And it was full. There were people standing up. And there was, you know, the SWIFT innovation officers and most of the banks that came to talk to us.

People, they understand. Ethereum is definitely seen as the standard and the place where you want to build because that’s where you have access to the most equity, the most users, the most vibrant DeFi ecosystem. Which is something that is getting closer, I think, and say, well, maybe there is some way to make some money here. I don’t know exactly.

SPEAKER_01: And that ties very nicely back to the start of the conversation and about the thoughts for the EEA and so on.

Something that Jeremy Millar said in the opening speech on the opening day was: think of this as being like a router, an internet/intranet. There’s no reason why suitably modular codebases shouldn’t serve all of these use cases, public and private.

And what we did not want to happen—and I remember being driven very much by this—was saying: let’s not have arbitrarily different codebases for these different things, because we can’t be asked having that conversation and making the effort to try and bridge those worlds.

And that was really coming from that Fabric and Corda competition of these big enterprises basically being told: Ethereum guys have got to get your stuff together or we’re going to get mandated to use this other stuff. And it doesn’t matter what you want. It’s like the spending will have been spent and it’s never coming back.

So to my mind, it’s really superb to see where we are. That was the goal, right? This can be a standard for everything. And yeah, things were immature and maybe you needed to be doing consortium chains and you needed to take these baby steps on the way and wait for the tech to catch up. But really: this can be the answer for everything. So, yeah.

SPEAKER_04: And we’re talking more and more. The Ethereum Foundation has done an incredible job. They have an enterprise team also, in conversation with everyone, and they have access to all the different leaders. And this has been pretty fantastic.

And so the more we discuss about this and say, hey, there is no CEO of Ethereum. It’s not a private company. There’s no CEO of the internet. You know, it was Linux, right? So that’s something that is catching up more and more.

And as we’re going, that’s also the mission, that’s what we do at the EEA: going to have this conversation, doing events, bringing people together. A few events that we do, we try to remix DeFi, traditional finance institutions, pure Ethereum players, and have all those people talking together. That’s how we make that moving forward.

Well, on that note, I think we’ll wrap up. But where can people find more about you and EEA in general?

Well, the website. We are present on all the social media. The website is entethalliance.org. We have the same handle on Twitter, on LinkedIn. I’m also on LinkedIn and Twitter and try to post often some few articles and some insights. And there’s some more work that I’m going to put together in a couple of weeks around RWAs and everything.

And also always looking for some large institution that would like to collaborate on some writing pieces. Yeah. So we can really put some thought leadership and helping, explaining what’s being done. And I think bridging the Ethereum world with the traditional finance is also something that we’re pretty excited to do in a couple of weeks.

Yeah, that’s awesome. We’ll be also in Singapore FinTech Week next month, in Devcon in Argentina, and we’ll be also in Abu Dhabi for Finance Week.

SPEAKER_01: Cool. And Bob, where can people find you?

So, yeah, I’m on Twitter, same as my name, Bob Summerwill with a W-I-L-L, not “ville,” not “Summerville.” Not the German spelling. No.

SPEAKER_03: Kieren?

SPEAKER_02: Kieren James-Lubin on X, YouTube, et cetera.

SPEAKER_03: And you can find me on X at… Vic, V-I-C, the number four, W-O-N-G.

Thank you for joining us for our first in-person roundtable. Thanks again. It’s awesome.

SPEAKER_04: Thanks for coming. Take care.
