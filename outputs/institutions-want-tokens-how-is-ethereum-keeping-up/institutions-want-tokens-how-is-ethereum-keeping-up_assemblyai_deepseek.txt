SPEAKER_00: What are you using? I use Restream. We try to use something and it's streamed on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

SPEAKER_01: So we're using Streamyard too. We're using Streamyard and I'm just double checking.

SPEAKER_02: We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit better.

SPEAKER_03: None of them are perfect.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, that. I'll share the one. I don't know if you should try this one, but this one looks pretty cool, pretty great.

SPEAKER_02: Because you're thinking there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Like isn't there just an answer that just works.

SPEAKER_00: But the thing is like those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind.

SPEAKER_03: They don't like it.

SPEAKER_02: They want to lock you in.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly. That's, that's, that's against our vision, you know, on decentralization.

SPEAKER_02: X there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's frustrating.

SPEAKER_02: Why would you want to download it?

SPEAKER_00: You know, like that's something, I guess the next step in maybe data ownership.

SPEAKER_02: Like you want to use it somewhere else.

SPEAKER_00: Are you seeing somebody else be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms, even own a query or just access? Something I love about Google is like I can go, I can activate the tracking, but at least I can go and say, what did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store, it was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things they have, like thousands of data points, but they don't even share it with you.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.

SPEAKER_00: I find it quite frustrating.

SPEAKER_03: 501.

SPEAKER_01: We are live. So we're live. No, no, I'm ready. No, but that was a good cold intro. Right, so we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for Devcon. For change. Our life in real life, in the same room. In the same room.

SPEAKER_02: Amazing.

SPEAKER_01: And you are a special guest. Dy.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Red 1 Meslan. Yes, Meslan, who is the executive director of the EA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years.

SPEAKER_03: Healthy run.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly.

SPEAKER_02: Right.

SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, like it's eight years now.

SPEAKER_00: It was 2017. Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: February 2017 was the launch date on the 28th.

SPEAKER_03: There was pre-work solidly before at least three months, maybe more.

SPEAKER_02: There were meetings I was part of in December and January. There were. I mean that, that those were the first big meetings.

SPEAKER_01: Right.

SPEAKER_02: You know, with whatever 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, like it really started probably at Devcon 2. Really close with the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

SPEAKER_03: There was the kickoff meeting at the J.P. Morgan office, which was pretty big. And even before they were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft.

SPEAKER_02: Right. So that public launch was February.

SPEAKER_03: It was February.

SPEAKER_00: But.

SPEAKER_02: But December there was an internal meeting. And then JP Morgan was in January 2017. But yeah, a lot of those initial contacts have happened at Devcon 2 in October the previous year.

SPEAKER_01: Well, at Devcon 2.

SPEAKER_03: Oh yes.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So like basically, there was a lot of conversation there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And yeah, like the group of people which was I think about six people that were interested, met at a Starbucks just offsite. And you know that was sort of the idea formation thing about the EA.

SPEAKER_02: And then Matt Spoke of Newco held a little bar-side event as well. Which. Do we have some technical issues?

SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay, hold on a second.

SPEAKER_03: I'm just gonna push.

SPEAKER_00: James is gonna tell everybody we have a technical issue.

SPEAKER_02: Everybody.

SPEAKER_01: I can. I was. I will fix that. Oh did I. I messed up the Twitter.

SPEAKER_02: You did a bad one.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I did a bad one. So everyone please join us on YouTube.

SPEAKER_03: Spaces at 5am Right.

SPEAKER_01: Yes.

SPEAKER_02: But yeah, Matt Spoke held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to and there were various others there. I don't know if you went to that one as well.

SPEAKER_01: I, I didn't go to that one. So I think it's. I think the main thing was that. Yeah, so I think the main thing I'm gonna try and fix this right now on Twitter live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now. If not, I did choose a.

SPEAKER_02: But also parallel in that because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was like an enterprise Slack set up there which was actually started by Vitalik who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise.

SPEAKER_01: That's right.

SPEAKER_02: So at some point he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was a. Not quite the same group. It was a larger group but slightly different.

SPEAKER_01: Nuko was part of that.

SPEAKER_02: Nuko was part of that also by.

SPEAKER_01: The way we should introduce ourselves.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Hi, I'm Bob Summerwill. I'm head of ecosystem at Stratum Card King.

SPEAKER_03: James Lubin, CEO of Black Ops. Victor, creators of Strato Mercado.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer. Blackouts. So sorry back.

SPEAKER_00: But.

SPEAKER_02: But yeah, Amos as well.

SPEAKER_01: Do you remember them?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we should check in on. I. I haven't thought about Amos in several years. Until the moment.

SPEAKER_02: So the interesting thing about what they were doing. So that was like some Taiwan bank consortium thing.

SPEAKER_01: Yep.

SPEAKER_02: But then they. They did work on Chinese cryptography and stuff. Like they've got differing requirements. Right?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: And Master Chain, which was in Russia, that was like a. A spare bank thing.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Before they got sanctioned. I have a question because you, you have, you know, I was not at EA at that time, and so it's very interesting for me to, you know, what were the hopes and really excitement that you see? You know, you were part of those early conversations. This was created by 13, I think, companies. It's like a pretty, it was a pretty big event, you know.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: As you mentioned, J.P. Morgan and everything. All those big names coming into the ecosystem and what were the hopes and really like the overall atmosphere, you know, when the EA was created like eight years ago.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, I mean, so, Consensus was very critical as well because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise engagement stuff. Right. You've got many, many companies, like, starting to get interested in, hey, you know, we want to do a pilot, we want to get involved. So Consensus was doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together. But, but yeah, you know, over those months, you really had like, they got a hell of a lot of momentum really, really quick.

SPEAKER_03: So the observation during Devcon 2, when the idea was hatched, was basically that at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had hacked their own consensus algorithms and security.

SPEAKER_02: And many guests.

SPEAKER_03: Many guests indeed. We learned later that like a lot of JP Morgan's Quorum was initially built by Jeff Wilkie. He had like some kind of.

SPEAKER_02: And that was not announced at the time of Devcon 2. That was still behind the scenes for a few months, but happened just before the EA started. But yeah, you've got all of this stuff brewing up. I mean, for years earlier, like, if you think of Eris db, that became Monax, that became Hyperledger, Burrow. So that was a permissioned Ethereum client off POC 5 pre-mainnet.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Mid 2014 of sticking in Tendermint onto an EVM. So, yeah, like, you know, it was. It was all a bit smashed apart, but it was like the time is right for us to work together because we've all got the same needs.

SPEAKER_03: Us too. We had our own client and it got used in a bunch of the Consensus consulting engagements at that time. And we started even then kind of tuning it for enterprise. And so I guess the idea was like, well, maybe enterprises won't adopt if there isn't a standard. Yeah. For all of this new stuff that they need that's above and beyond the base.

SPEAKER_01: Well, Ethereum clients, I think it was even beyond that. Like there was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company siloed to get Ethereum to do what they wanted to do in a private way. So everyone was holding on these things. And what came out of those early conversations at Devcon was, wait, we're all doing similar things. Maybe if we all kind of work together we could do it faster and get this up faster. And that was all around private Ethereum.

SPEAKER_02: And I guess also like a marriage between like kind of customers of these things and builders.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Of saying you've got all these kind of startup-y kind of companies that are making Ethereum things and you've obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this. But it's.

SPEAKER_01: There's.

SPEAKER_02: But yeah, on that standardization side, there was like nothing. And it's like you're all going to get vendor locked, like instantly and it'll all just be arbitrarily different and painful and horrible. So let's try and work out because. Well, at some point as well with Quorum, it was kind of like, you know, are we gonna like collaboratively do code bases as well? Like, you know, Hyperledger was another piece into this. Is that. Is that a few months earlier I've spent a bunch of time working on C relicensing C client to get back to Apache 2. So it could have been contributed into Hyperledger and we could have like gathered around that. That up. So the EA was kind of a backup, I guess, of like, right. We can't have this grand fusion, but there's enough happening on the Ethereum side that we can at least get all the Ethereum pieces together. And. And then, yeah, I guess it went quite quickly from, okay, we're not. We don't want to straight compete with Hyperledger. Having a shared code base also kind of like screws.

SPEAKER_03: No one wanted to. So I think, let me, you know, in the spirit of spiciness, I think the enterprise users would have preferred a shared code base.

SPEAKER_02: Right.

SPEAKER_03: And they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor locked again. They've had these horrific IBM nightmares, Oracle nightmares over the years and they're just like not, not this time.

SPEAKER_01: We're not going to live through this.

SPEAKER_02: I mean also, you know, you have got that market pressure right. Of Corda coming out of IBM launching Fabric.

SPEAKER_01: They were worried it would end up.

SPEAKER_03: That kind of, you know, nominally open source but quite proprietary.

SPEAKER_02: So those were both shooting for release in February 2017. So it's, that kind of timeline is like, right. We've got to get our together to be able to do like an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM and R3DA at that time.

SPEAKER_03: Like I remember one of our prominent enterprise users, EA members said, you know, yeah, they've got a call with you know, 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks, let's say.

SPEAKER_01: Right.

SPEAKER_03: And it's funny that all of the like Ethereum just survived all of this more or less not paying any attention and like, you know, the competition kind of came in.

SPEAKER_01: Well, I think there was another parallel thing that was happening at that Devcon really were like the first like the kind of enterprise use cases we talk about today. Like for example, Santander talked about, you know, US dollar on chain which we all recognize as a stablecoin now and.

SPEAKER_03: Tokenize bank deposit.

SPEAKER_00: You see Victor, I think that's a very cool parallel. Like you set the stage pretty well for like, you know, where it's coming from.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: And where it started eight years ago you mentioned Innovation Labs, like starting to contribute to some code. We've known the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it's only actually now and it's been for probably like the last year that things have been really changing drastically.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: And to take your words for like when you say innovation that it's not innovation labs anymore looking at how they implement blockchain in their ecosystem. It's really like it's actually executive teams that say we want to plan what is the production, like how we get into market.

SPEAKER_03: Thankfully like they're scared now so like they better move or else.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, I don't know if it's like there's no there is. But there were some interesting talks, like when we were at Sibos, the Swift conference.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we should mention that because you were just at Sibos and you're dealing with what we think of as shred by institutional players and that's where you have a lot of communication. So like what were your impressions about where they're at with that? Because that's the other side that we talk about.

SPEAKER_00: The digital asset tokenization is definitely a hot topic. Everyone is looking because they know it's happening. They want to be involved and it's more. And now especially there is less regulatory uncertainty.

SPEAKER_03: The listeners may not know what Sibos is.

SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_00: So Sibos is the big Swift conference. Swift, if you're not familiar, is a messaging system that a lot of 11,000 financial institutions around the world use. It's actually a co-op, it's a DAO for traffic. Kudos to Danielle from Consensys who said that to me once.

SPEAKER_03: It is, although it's like, can we buy in now? I feel like.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the token is having probably a bank license.

SPEAKER_03: The London Metal Exchange is like this too. It's like you want to sign up, you got to like buy a bunch of shares and like.

SPEAKER_01: Yes.

SPEAKER_03: You know, then there's an annual fee and whatnot and you have to like put someone there all the time.

SPEAKER_02: You have to join the trade guild.

SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes.

SPEAKER_02: You've got to do your.

SPEAKER_01: Yes.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly. And so Sibos conference is the big mecca of payments every year. So you have all the big financial institutions also like global financial institutions, clearinghouse settlements, like DTCC etc, but also all the banks and they gather here and there is a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually Sibos and Swift is a very standard organization because what they do is how we make sure we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. And so they used to have a different kind of messaging format and recently now they're migrating to something new which is ISO 222.

SPEAKER_01: Okay.

SPEAKER_00: Which is if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really how every financial institution wants to discuss. They've been working on that spec for a long time and that's how anything that can touch finance from securities to payment, like they have to be qualified.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think it's good to explain. So like most of finance gets cleared through messaging and it's like. So crypto people are used to like putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere.

SPEAKER_00: Yes.

SPEAKER_03: It's not really like this.

SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah. Thank you. Indeed. That's a very key point. The process of what we call delivery versus payment in traditional finance is a pretty complex thing because how you make sure like when you deliver the money, the money has been received, that you receive the asset, that everything has been settled. And it's a lot of dance because you receive messages, you send another one. And it's not like how we used to do in crypto where we submit and it's actually an atomic transaction, which is just one thing. And when the transaction is complete, it's been executed, it's been delivered and all the parties know that. That is actually, you know, I give you the can. Well, I know, I know you've been giving me the money.

SPEAKER_02: Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: You know, where actually there is a little bit dance. Well, I put the can here. Like you see the can that has been moving here, you send the money. And so blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things like T plus 1 or T plus 2 for some of those different exchanges. Now you do it in seconds or even less than that.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: And also Swift isn't a payments mechanism, right?

SPEAKER_00: No, it's a messaging system.

SPEAKER_02: That's another common misconception.

SPEAKER_03: Let me interject with an example. I think they're biggest in FX, right?

SPEAKER_01: Yes.

SPEAKER_03: So let's say I've got some USD, I want some Euro and we agree to a USD Euro trade. And so we like, I guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at and I think it's like I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to Swift and you do too. And then Swift checks if it matches, it charges like seven bucks either way. If it does match, then it'll tell us that it matched.

SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't think it's actually exactly this way. It's more Swift offers a type of envelope and a format of envelope and paper and ink that we know how to use and how we're supposed to fill up forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants. It's not much people like they're gonna be some corresponding banking that's gonna be locally they can do cash and they're gonna take their share.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. It's not moving the asset. It's just. It's like, like I have the USD on my bank list.

SPEAKER_00: On your bank talking to each other in a secure and compliant way. Because it's also. You send that. You have to send some specific messaging for compliance that nets. Then I send another one saying I checked there's information and you.

SPEAKER_02: You know a bunch of like local jurisdiction specific.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. A lot of different handshakes.

SPEAKER_01: You know I like the way someone described it's like a funny TCP handshake. Yeah. It's sort of like what they're doing is tracking the transfers but no money is actually moving. And then they have a list of IOUs. So like when I send a Swift transaction from let's say I send a hundred dollars to you and friends and I go to my bank, I put in a hundred dollars. The money doesn't go anywhere. You're just.

SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_00: So I have to write USD off. They let at the end of the day.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: RTGS, they're gonna do like the transfer actually. Exactly.

SPEAKER_03: That's like a different messaging.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: If you research and I'm not a Swift expert but I have learned that the last couple of months, I've done a little bit more deep dive. And it's fascinating because there is such a huge dance between two transfers of money because you have the money in your bank account, but then actually central bank money. Then you have also the deposit money. Those what you call M0, M1, M2. And so all of that is pretty complex. And then we're just talking about payment here, talking about securities or those other financial instruments that you can exchange. Also using blockchain in a very efficient way. But that's using stablecoin you can make everything super simple. And also one misconception maybe I would love to mention is like we talked about stablecoin and CBDCs.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: They are actually exactly the same thing. It's just in a different context. A CBDC is a stablecoin for central bank.

SPEAKER_02: And it's just the issuer.

SPEAKER_00: It's just the issuer is not the same as you know, we never going to retouch CBDCs because this is the money of banks. If you say. But almost I think from a technical level it's very like almost like a copy paste of the same contract. The mechanism it's not but we create a whole different language and terminology for that. But they're actually very similar and funny fact those CBDCs they've been doing you know like the. I think the baby needed to grow. You know like said Devcon 2. So it was a 2 years old kid Ethereum and we were like hey come in here. You can manage the most critical infrastructure of the planet which is our money and how we do trade and you can do all of this. And I think the Ethereum Foundation I have to give them credit like they yes for a long time they were saying hey guys, you're not considering the enterprise everything. But I think they did the right thing because they protected that baby so it could grow and it become like you know now we had an age of it's more mature. It's more than 10 years. It's still like not even a teenager. The analogy was like with human is going to take some limits. But we had a point now where we have a technology and Ethereum is really a capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing. You know that we're blocking with institutions to adopt which is scalability, privacy, composability and interoperability like the four points that you had in the ARC paper from Circle. And now we have just last week Zksync announced up to 15,000 TPS and there is some new thing that almost every week going on. So we really like now the technology when it can look say well I need to make sure this is private. I need to make sure this is going to be executed in a seamless way. Also the decentralization it's more about the way they look at it is more like the vendor locking. I would say the best analogy is that you want to make sure the infrastructure you rely on is going to be able to absorb your activity but also be resilient enough. This we still have some work because it's definitely and I understand the perspective of institutions to deploy on public infrastructure. You know at first when Wikipedia showed up like you know, 2020, 25 years ago, something like that I think. I mean I remember I was at my engineering college. I was at the board and we were talking about having wiki for doing some articles. And they were those very academic guys said this is unacceptable. It's not the whole French accent and this is unacceptable. Whenever I'm going to do this, anyone can put any information. It's not trust.

SPEAKER_01: To be clear, you are French. Yeah. You are allowed to.

SPEAKER_00: You're allowed. And they were very protective of it. And at that time I said, well, we cannot trust something that's being built collectively like this. But now we know you have to take a grain of salt. But it's actually much more accepted like those are reliable sources of information and that you can have things that are being built publicly that actually very resilient.

SPEAKER_01: I mean, sorry, I was just gonna ask like. But there's always this gap between what traditional institutions understand about what's been capable for a really long time. But are there still gaps or do you think that's been closed now? Like is the baby grown up fully or? But even if the capability is there, there's still a knowledge gap. I think sometimes, you know.

SPEAKER_00: Well, let me put it this way. There is about. If you combine all the different type of money, $123 trillion of cash around the world, right. 300 billions are on chain, right. So the numbers talk for itself. We're very early. So there is people like they can. I think we still have a lot of work to do in terms of education. But by education I mean really talking from product perspective. What business problem I can solve for you, how it's going to be done, what is going to be the maintenance after, how you're going to deal with very specific use cases. And so you can have some teams that already have an understanding what you can achieve. But we still need to provide I think as an ecosystem more structuring who you can work with the different vendors, what services they can do, where they can help, what's the type of contract you're going to have after. And really giving that overall perspective of a new entrant in the market. And so some of them, they understand very well and they have already some pretty detailed question, even asking me about increasing the contract size from 24 to 40, 48 kilobytes. And we have some stack overflow issues like well known.

SPEAKER_03: So the stack depth limit was always a problem.

SPEAKER_00: And so there is some of them it's this but then some other ones in this more product they're going to ask me okay why should I go on an L2 what is the L1? What does it mean? And what about those chain. What are the primitives explaining like? Well if you build on any L2s you actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way but you can completely move your asset free among all the ecosystem the wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent that you don't have to rebuild. And so those are things you need to explain. Some of them maybe people they're going to say well what is this? This is just like some scammy or something like that. I think you can find all the layers. But now people they also see the potential of what you can do with digital assets tokenization. And for people who are a little bit looking around I'm very excited to see what's going to happen in the next six to 12 months because Genius Tech was signed July 15or something like this cavity Act. I think it's still, still a bit ongoing but so now we like the like and we can also hear that like there's really companies from either direction say okay how we're going to implement this. The fintech is also moving so they're building their L1 even if they're building the L1 I wish they would do some L2s and my door will always be open when you want to consider that there is a pretty great tool that can help but that's going to push the market and from financial institution to really adopting this. There is an organization like dtcc, the biggest clearinghouse in the world. All the securities in the world basically are being cleared over there. They released an incredible product like 4 months ago in April. The great collateral where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contract that allows you to clear and to make some margin call and collateral management from different jurisdiction which is a fantastic use case when you see I'm not a collateral management expert but I understand the value like how this unlocks. You know you actually have something that you can take from your bank in Japan that you're going to post for something in the US because you have a market event and this is something you would not even imagine before and now you can do it and it's compliant. It's actually like it's legal and then that can unlock so much efficiencies. And so that's in the next 12 months. That's going to be a huge game changer.

SPEAKER_01: So it sounds like the lid has been lifted off and there's a ton of demand but it's like walking down the path to supply that demand. That's the part that people are figuring out right? Is that right.

SPEAKER_00: Like I think it's such a very transformative technology for how those businesses operate. There is also how I'm going to make money.

SPEAKER_01: Okay. So there's a fear element to it, right?

SPEAKER_00: It's like, well now I can have like check out like yeah, I mean I'm a PSP provider.

SPEAKER_03: Like let me ask you this. So in the early days it felt like there was a focus on more like back office use cases. Like how do I move the collateral from like my Japan regional branch to my whatever.

SPEAKER_02: Business process improvements.

SPEAKER_03: Business process improvements. And I felt that there's eventually became a shift for big corporations wanting top line use cases like Nike was the first to sell a ton of NFTs. And then you're seeing like the digital asset treasuries are a kind of genius way for a token to like the company doesn't have to IPO but there could be a token and there can be something that provides the traditional protections of equity that's publicly traded. And then you didn't, you could just leave this part sort of where it was and somehow there's kind of like a merger going on and there's creating good top line revenue for investment banks and et cetera, et cetera. So is your sense.

SPEAKER_00: That.

SPEAKER_03: People want the efficiency to compete or like are they starting to think about it as like a new revenue line or you know like transformed revenue line or something?

SPEAKER_00: Well that's a billion trillion dollar question right there. I don't have the answer. What I could say is I see how like I think if you look at operational optimization, it's more than that. If you capital flow more seamlessly, you make more money in a financial float. So the more you have a flow of your money easy, the more you're going to be able to make some capital improvements yet I think and from conversation I've seen and where the still don't have the golden do say hey that's gonna remix a little bit of all the different people and intermediaries and people working because if you suddenly have something that is being done a much more efficient way. Well some different intermediates they might have to rethink where the way of doing their business. This is not going to happen from one day to another. What I can say is that because we're going to have those
