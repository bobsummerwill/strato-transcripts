**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** What are you using? I use Restream. We try to use something and it's stream on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

**[00:10] SPEAKER_01:** So we're using Streamyard too. We're using Streamyard and I'm just double checking.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_02:** We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit.

**[00:24] SPEAKER_03:** None of them are perfect.

**[00:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. I'll share the one. I don't know if you should try this one, but this one looks pretty cool, pretty great.

**[00:30] SPEAKER_02:** Because you're thinking there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Isn't there just an answer that just works.

**[00:39] SPEAKER_00:** But the thing is those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind.

**[00:43] SPEAKER_03:** They don't like it.

**[00:44] SPEAKER_02:** They want to trap you in.

**[00:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, exactly. That's against our vision, you know.

**[00:50] SPEAKER_02:** On X there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio.

**[00:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[00:56] SPEAKER_02:** Why would you want to download it?

**[00:57] SPEAKER_00:** That's something, I guess the next step in maybe.

**[01:00] SPEAKER_02:** You want to use it somewhere else.

**[01:03] SPEAKER_00:** Are you seeing somebody else be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms, even own a query or just access. Something I love about Google is I can go. I can activate the tracking, but at least I can go and say, what did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store, it was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things they have thousands of data, but they don't even share it with you.

**[01:31] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:33] SPEAKER_00:** I find it quite well.

**[01:38] SPEAKER_03:** 501.

**[01:40] SPEAKER_01:** We are live. So we're live. No, no, I'm ready. No, but that was a good cold intro. Right, so we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for a change are live in real life, in the same room. In the same room.

**[01:58] SPEAKER_02:** Amazing.

**[01:59] SPEAKER_01:** And you are a special guest, Dy.

**[02:02] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Redouane Meslan, who is the executive director of the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years.

**[02:21] SPEAKER_03:** Healthy run.

**[02:22] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly.

**[02:23] SPEAKER_02:** Right.

**[02:23] SPEAKER_03:** So, yeah, it's eight years now.

**[02:26] SPEAKER_00:** It was 2017. Yeah.

**[02:28] SPEAKER_02:** February 2017 was the launch date on the 28th.

**[02:30] SPEAKER_03:** There was pre work solidly before at least three months, maybe more.

**[02:34] SPEAKER_02:** There were meetings I was part of in December and January. There were. I mean, those were the first big meetings.

**[02:43] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[02:44] SPEAKER_02:** You know, with whatever 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, it really started probably at Devcon 2. Really close with the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

**[02:57] SPEAKER_03:** There was the kickoff meeting at the J.P. Morgan office, which was pretty big. And even before they were the closed door meetings at Microsoft.

**[03:06] SPEAKER_02:** Right. So that public launch was February.

**[03:09] SPEAKER_03:** It was February.

**[03:10] SPEAKER_00:** But.

**[03:10] SPEAKER_02:** But December there was an internal one. And then JP Morgan was in January 2017. But yeah, a lot of those initial contacts happened at Devcon 2 in October the previous year.

**[03:25] SPEAKER_01:** Well, in Devcon 2.

**[03:27] SPEAKER_03:** Oh yes.

**[03:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So basically, basically there was a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And yeah, the group of people which was I think about six people that were interested, met at a Starbucks just off site. And you know that was sort of the idea formation thing about the.

**[03:58] SPEAKER_02:** And then Matt Spoke of Nuco held a little, little bar side event as well. Which. Do we have some technical issues?

**[04:15] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, okay, hold on a second.

**[04:16] SPEAKER_03:** I'm just gonna push.

**[04:17] SPEAKER_00:** James is gonna tell everybody we have a technical issue.

**[04:21] SPEAKER_02:** Everybody.

**[04:22] SPEAKER_01:** I can. I was. I will fix that. Oh did I. I messed up the Twitter.

**[04:27] SPEAKER_02:** You did a bad one.

**[04:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I did a bad one. So everyone please join us on YouTube.

**[04:33] SPEAKER_03:** Spaces at 5am right.

**[04:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[04:36] SPEAKER_02:** But yeah, Matt Spoke held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to and there were various others there. I don't know if you went to that one as well.

**[04:46] SPEAKER_01:** I didn't go to that one. So I think the main thing was that. Yeah, so I think the main thing. I'm gonna try and fix this right now on Twitter live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now. If not, I did choose a.

**[05:08] SPEAKER_02:** But also parallel in that because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was an enterprise Slack set up there which was actually started by Vitalik who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise.

**[05:26] SPEAKER_01:** That's right.

**[05:27] SPEAKER_02:** So at some point he just dumped them all in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was a. Not quite the same group. It was a larger group but slightly different.

**[05:41] SPEAKER_01:** Nuco was part of that.

**[05:42] SPEAKER_02:** Nuco was part of that also by.

**[05:47] SPEAKER_01:** The way we should introduce ourselves.

**[05:50] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Hi, I'm Bob Summerwill. I'm head of ecosystem at Stratum Card King.

**[05:56] SPEAKER_03:** James Lubin, CEO of BlockApps, creators of Strato Mercado.

**[06:01] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[06:01] SPEAKER_01:** And Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer, BlockApps. So sorry back.

**[06:05] SPEAKER_00:** But.

**[06:05] SPEAKER_02:** But yeah, Amos as well.

**[06:07] SPEAKER_01:** Do you remember them?

**[06:08] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, we should check in on. I haven't thought about Amos in several years until the moment.

**[06:16] SPEAKER_02:** So the interesting thing about what they were doing. So that was some Taiwan bank consortium thing.

**[06:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yep.

**[06:23] SPEAKER_02:** But then they did work on Chinese cryptography and stuff. They've got differing requirements, right?

**[06:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[06:31] SPEAKER_02:** And Master Chain, which was in Russia, that was a Sberbank thing.

**[06:41] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[06:43] SPEAKER_00:** Before they got sanctioned. I have a question because you have, I was not at EEA at that time, and so it's very interesting for me to know, what were the hopes and really excitement that you see? You were part of those early conversations. This was created with 13 companies. It was a pretty big event, as you mentioned, J.P. Morgan and everything. All those big names coming into the ecosystem and what were the hopes and really the overall atmosphere when the EEA was created eight years ago.

**[07:01] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[07:02] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[07:13] SPEAKER_02:** Well, I mean, ConsenSys were very critical as well because they were doing a load of the enterprise engagement stuff. Right. You've got many, many companies starting to get interested in, hey, we want to do a pilot, we want to get involved. So ConsenSys were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together. But yeah, over those months, you really had they got a hell of a lot of momentum really quick.

**[07:48] SPEAKER_03:** So the observation during Devcon 2, when the idea was hatched, was basically that at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had hacked their own consensus algorithms and security.

**[08:06] SPEAKER_02:** And many gas.

**[08:08] SPEAKER_03:** Many gas indeed. We learned later that a lot of JP Morgan's Quorum was initially built by Jeff Wilcke. He had some kind of.

**[08:21] SPEAKER_02:** And that was not announced at the time of Devcon 2. That was still behind the scenes for a few months, but happened just before the EEA started. But yeah, you've got all of this stuff brewing up. I mean, for years earlier, if you think of Eris DB, that became Monax, that became Hyperledger Burrow. So that was a permissioned Ethereum client off PoC 5 pre-mainnet.

**[08:49] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[08:50] SPEAKER_02:** Mid-2014 of sticking in Tendermint onto an EVM. So yeah, it was all a bit smashed apart, but it was the time is right for us to work together because we've all got the same needs.

**[09:07] SPEAKER_03:** Us too. We had our own client and it got used in a bunch of the ConsenSys consulting engagements at that time. And we started even then kind of tuning it for enterprise. And so I guess the idea was well, maybe enterprises won't adopt if there isn't a standard for all of this new stuff that they need that's above and beyond the base.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_01:** Well, Ethereum clients, I think it was even beyond that. There was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company siloed to get Ethereum to do what they wanted to do in a private way. So everyone was holding on these things. And what came out of those early conversations at Devcon was, wait, we're all doing similar things. Maybe if we all kind of work together we could do it faster and get this up faster. And that was all around private Ether.

**[10:07] SPEAKER_02:** And I guess also a marriage between customers of these things and builders.

**[10:14] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[10:14] SPEAKER_02:** Of saying you've got all these startupy companies that are making Ethereum things and you've obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this. But it's.

**[10:26] SPEAKER_01:** There's.

**[10:27] SPEAKER_02:** But yeah, on that standardization side, there was nothing. And it's you're all going to get vendor locked instantly and it'll all just be arbitrarily different and painful and horrible. So let's try and work out because. Well, at some point as well with Quorum, it was kind of are we gonna collaboratively do code bases as well? Hyperledger was another piece into this. Is that. Is that a few months earlier I've spent a bunch of time working on C relicensing C client to get back to Apache 2. So it could have been contributed into Hyperledger and we could have gathered around that. That up. So the EEA was kind of a backup, I guess, of right. We can't have this grand fusion, but there's enough happening on the Ethereum side that we can at least get all the Ethereum pieces together. And then yeah, I guess it went quite quickly from, okay, we're not. We don't want to straight compete with Hyperledger. Having a shared code base also kind of screws.

**[11:38] SPEAKER_03:** No one wanted to. So I think, let me, you know, in the spirit of spiciness, I think the enterprise users would have preferred a shared code base.

**[11:50] SPEAKER_02:** Right.

**[11:50] SPEAKER_03:** And they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor locked again. They've had these horrific IBM nightmares, Oracle nightmares over the years and they're just not, not this time.

**[12:08] SPEAKER_01:** We're not going to live through this.

**[12:10] SPEAKER_02:** I mean also, you've got that market pressure right. Of Corda coming out of IBM launching Fabric.

**[12:19] SPEAKER_01:** They were worried it would end up.

**[12:20] SPEAKER_03:** That kind of nominally open source but quite proprietary.

**[12:24] SPEAKER_02:** So those were both shooting for release in February 2017. So it's that kind of timeline is right. We've got to get our act together to be able to do an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM and R3 at that time.

**[12:42] SPEAKER_03:** I remember one of our prominent enterprise users, EEA members said, you know, yeah, they've got a call with 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks, let's say.

**[12:56] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[12:56] SPEAKER_03:** And it's funny that all of the Ethereum just survived all of this more or less not paying any attention and the competition kind of came in.

**[13:08] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I think there was another parallel thing that was happening at that Devcon really where the first enterprise use cases we talk about today. For example, Santander talked about US dollar on chain which we all recognize as a stablecoin now and.

**[13:30] SPEAKER_03:** Tokenized bank deposit.

**[13:32] SPEAKER_00:** You see Victor, I think that's a very cool parallel. You set the stage pretty well for where it's coming from.

**[13:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[13:39] SPEAKER_00:** And where it started eight years ago you mentioned innovation labs starting to contribute to some codes. We've known the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it's only actually now and it's been for probably the last year that things have been really changing drastically.

**[13:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[13:58] SPEAKER_00:** And to take your words for when you say innovation that it's not innovation labs anymore looking at how they implement blockchain in their ecosystem. It's really executive team that say hey, we want to plan what is the production, how we get into market.

**[14:16] SPEAKER_03:** Thankfully they're scared now so they better move or else.

**[14:20] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, I don't know if it's that but there were some interesting talks when we were at Sibos, the Swift conference.

**[14:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, we should mention that because you were just at Sibos and you're dealing with what we think of as tradfi institutional players and that's where you have a lot of communication. So what were your impressions about where they're at with that? Because that's the other side that we talk about.

**[14:47] SPEAKER_00:** The digital asset tokenization is definitely a hot topic. Everyone is looking because they know it's happening. They want to be involved and it's more. And now especially there is less regulatory, you know.

**[15:06] SPEAKER_03:** The listeners may not know what Sibos is.

**[15:08] SPEAKER_01:** Oh yeah.

**[15:08] SPEAKER_00:** So Sibos is the big Swift conference. Swift, if you're not familiar, is a messaging system that a lot of 11,000 financial institutions around the world. It's actually a co-op, it's a DAO for tradfi. Kudos to Danielle from ConsenSys who said that to me once.

**[15:26] SPEAKER_03:** It is, although it's can we buy in now? I feel like.

**[15:34] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, the token is having probably a bank license.

**[15:37] SPEAKER_03:** The London Metal Exchange is like this too. It's you want to sign up, you got to buy a bunch of shares and.

**[15:43] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[15:44] SPEAKER_03:** You know, then there's an annual fee and whatnot and you have to put someone there all the time.

**[15:49] SPEAKER_02:** You have to join the trade guild.

**[15:51] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes.

**[15:52] SPEAKER_02:** You've got to do your.

**[15:53] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[15:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, exactly. And so Sibos conference is the big mecca of payments I would say every year. So you have all the big financial institutions also global financial institutions, clearinghouses settlements, DTCC etc, but also all the banks and they gather here and there is a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually Sibos and Swift is a very standard organization because what they do is how we make sure we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand. And so they used to have a different kind of messaging format and recently now they're migrating to something new which is ISO 20022.

**[16:37] SPEAKER_01:** Okay.

**[16:38] SPEAKER_00:** Which is if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really how every financial institution want to discuss. They've been working on that spec for a long time and that's how anything that can touch finance from securities to payment, they have to be qualified.

**[16:54] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I think it's good to explain. So most of finance gets cleared through messaging and it's. So crypto people are used to putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere.

**[17:06] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[17:07] SPEAKER_03:** It's not really like this.

**[17:08] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah. Thank you. Yeah, indeed. That's a very key point. Is that the process of what we call delivery versus payment in traditional finance, it's a pretty complex thing because how you make sure when you deliver the money, the money has been received, that you receive the asset, that everything has been, and it's a kind of a lot of dance because you receive message, you send another one. And it's not how we used to do where in crypto we submit and it's actually an atomic transaction, which is just one thing. And when the transaction is complete, you know, it's been executed, it's been delivered and all the parties. That is actually, you know, I give you the can. Well, I know you've been giving me the money.

**[17:54] SPEAKER_02:** Exactly.

**[17:55] SPEAKER_00:** You know, where actually there is a little bit dance. Well, I put the can here. You see the can that has been moving here, you send the money. And so the blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things that where the T plus 1 or T plus 2 for some of those different exchanges. Now you do it depending on what chain you're going to deploy between a second to even less than that.

**[18:19] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[18:19] SPEAKER_02:** And also Swift isn't a payments mechanism, right?

**[18:23] SPEAKER_00:** No, it's a message.

**[18:25] SPEAKER_02:** That's another common.

**[18:27] SPEAKER_03:** Let me interject with a.

**[18:28] SPEAKER_02:** This specific example.

**[18:30] SPEAKER_03:** I think they're biggest in FX, right?

**[18:32] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[18:32] SPEAKER_03:** So let's say I've got some USD, I want some Euro and we kind of agree to a USD Euro trade. And so we look up whatever the pair is trading at and I think it's I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to Swift and you do too. And then Swift checks if it matches, it charges seven bucks either way. If it does match, then it'll tell us that it matched.

**[19:04] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I don't think it's actually exactly this way. It's more Swift offer a type of envelope and a format of envelope and paper and ink that we know how to use and how we're supposed to fill up some forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants. It's not much people they're gonna be some corresponding banking that's gonna be locally they can do cash and everyone's gonna take their share.

**[19:30] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. It's not moving the asset. It's just. It's like I have the USD on my bank list.

**[19:39] SPEAKER_00:** On your bank talking to each other in a secure and compliant way for. Because it's also. Oh, you send that. You have to send some specific messaging for compliance that net. Then I send another one, say hey I checked there's information and you.

**[19:54] SPEAKER_02:** You know a bunch of local jurisdiction specific.

**[19:58] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. A lot of different handshakes.

**[20:00] SPEAKER_01:** You know I like the way someone described it's a funny TCP handshake. Yeah. It's sort of what they're doing is tracking the transfers but no money is actually moving. And then they have a list of IOUs. So when I send a Swift transaction from let's say I send a hundred dollars to you in France and I go to my bank, I put in a hundred dollars. The money doesn't go anywhere. You're just.

**[20:28] SPEAKER_03:** Oh yeah.

**[20:29] SPEAKER_00:** So I have to write USD off. They let at the end of the day.

**[20:33] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[20:35] SPEAKER_00:** RTGS, they're gonna do the transfer actually. Exactly.

**[20:38] SPEAKER_03:** That's a different messaging.

**[20:40] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[20:40] SPEAKER_00:** If you research and I'm not a Swift expert but I have learned that the last couple of months, I've done a little bit more deep dive. And it's fascinating because there is such a huge dance between two transfer of money because you have the money in your bank account, but then actually central bank money. Then you have also the deposit money. Those what you call M0, M1, M2. And so all of that is pretty complex. And then we're just talking about payment here, talking about securities or those other financial instruments that you can exchange. Also using blockchain in a very efficient way. But that's using stablecoin you can make everything super simple. And also one misconception maybe I would love to mention is the we talked about stablecoin and CBDCs.

**[21:26] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[21:27] SPEAKER_00:** They actually exactly the same thing. It's just in a different context. A CBDC is a stablecoin for central bank.

**[21:36] SPEAKER_02:** And it's just the issuer.

**[21:37] SPEAKER_00:** It's just the issuer is not the same as we never going to retouch CBDCs because this is the money of banks. If you say. But almost I think from a technical level it's very almost a copy paste of the same contract. The mechanism it's, it's not but we create a whole different language and terminology for that. But they're actually very similar and funny fact those CBDCs they've been doing the. I think the baby needed to grow. Said Devcon 2. So it was a 2 years old kid Ethereum and we were hey come in here. You can manage the most critical infrastructure of the planet which is our money and how we do trade and you can do all of this. And I think the Ethereum Foundation I have to give them credit they yes for a long time they were saying hey guys, you're not considering the enterprise everything. But I think they did the right thing because they protected that baby so it could grow and it become now we had an age of it's more mature. It's more than 10 years. It's still not even a teenager the analogy with human is going to take some limits. But we had a point now where we have a technology and Ethereum is really a capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing that we're blocking with institution to adopt which is scalability, privacy composability and interoperability the four points that you had in the ARC paper from Circle. And now we have this just last week zkSync announced up to 15,000 TPS and there is some new thing that almost every week going on. So we really now the technology when it can look say well I need to make sure this is private. I need to make sure this is going to be executed in a seamless way. Also the decentralization it's more about the way they look at it is more the vendor locking. I would say the best analogy is that you want to make sure the infrastructure you rely on is going to be able to absorb your activity but also be resilient enough. This we still have some work because it's definitely and I understand the perspective of institution to deploy on public infrastructure. You know at first when Wikipedia showed up 20, 25 years ago, something like that I think. I mean I remember I was at my engineering college. I was at the board and we were talking about having wiki for doing some articles. And they were those very academic guys said this is unacceptable. With the whole French accent and this is unacceptable. Whenever I'm going to do this, anyone can put any information. It's not trust.

**[24:34] SPEAKER_01:** To be clear, you are French. Yeah. You are allowed to.

**[24:38] SPEAKER_00:** And so, and but they were in French they were very protecting this. And at that time I said, well, we cannot trust something that's being built collectively like this. But now we know you have to take a grain of salt. But it's actually much more accepted that those are reliable source of information and that you can have things that are being built publicly that actually very resilient.

**[25:02] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, sorry, I was just gonna ask. But there's always this gap between what traditional institutions understand about we all understand what's been capable for a really long time. But are there still gaps or do you think that's been closed now? Is the baby grown up fully or. But even if the capability is there, there's still a knowledge gap sometimes, you know.

**[25:31] SPEAKER_00:** Well, let me put it this way. There is about. If you combine all the different type of money, $123 trillion of cash around the world, right. 300 billion are on chain, right. So the numbers talk for itself. We're very early. So there is people they can. I think we still have a lot of work to do in terms of education. But by education I mean really talking from product perspective. What business problem I can solve for you, how it's going to be done, what is going to be the maintenance after how you're going to deal with a very specific use cases. And so you can have some teams that already have an understanding what you can achieve. But we still need to provide I think as an ecosystem more structuring who you can work with the different vendors, what services they can do, where they can help, what's the type of contract you're going to have after. And really giving that overall perspective of a new entrant in the market. And so some of them, they understand very well and they have already some pretty detailed question even asking me Redouane we need to increase the contract size from 24 to 48 kilobytes. And we have some those Stack Overflow issues well known.

**[26:54] SPEAKER_03:** So the stack depth limit was always a problem.

**[26:57] SPEAKER_00:** And so there is some of them it's this but then some other ones in this more product they're going to ask me okay why should I go on an L2 what is the L1? What does it mean? And what about those chains. What are the primitives explaining well if you build on any L2s you actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way but you can completely move your asset free among all the ecosystem the wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent that you don't have to rebuild. And so those are things you need to explain. Some of them maybe people they're going to say well what is this? This is just some scammy or something like that. I think you can find all the layers. But now people they also they see the potential of what you can do with digital assets tokenization. And for people who are a little bit looking around I'm very excited to see what's going to happen in the next six to 12 months because Genesis Tech was signed July 15 or something like this Cavity Act. I think it's still a bit ongoing but so now we the and we can also hear that there's really companies from either direction say okay how we're going to implement this. The fintech is also moving so they're building their L. Even if they're building the L1 I wish they would do some L2s and my door will always be open when they want to consider that there is a pretty great tool that can help but that's going to push the market and from financial institution to really adopting this. There is an organization like DTCC, the biggest clearinghouse in the world. All the securities in the world basically are being cleared over there. They released an incredible product 4 months ago in April. The great collateral where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contracts that allows you to clear and to make some margin call and collateral management from different jurisdiction which is a fantastic use case when you see I'm not a collateral management expert but I understand the value how this unlocks. You actually have something that you can take from your bank in Japan that you're going to post for something in the US because you have a market event and this is something you would not even imagine before and now you can do it and it's compliant. It's actually legal and then that can unlock so much efficiencies. And so that's in the next 12 months. That's going to be huge game changer.

**[29:39] SPEAKER_01:** So it sounds like the lid has been lifted off and there's a ton of demand but it's walking down the path to supply that demand. That's the part that people are figuring out right?

**[29:52] SPEAKER_00:** I think it's such a very transformative technology for how those businesses operate. There is also how I'm going to make money.

**[30:02] SPEAKER_01:** Okay. So there's a fear element to it, right?

**[30:07] SPEAKER_00:** It's well now I can have check out yeah, I mean I'm a PSP provider.

**[30:13] SPEAKER_03:** Let me ask you this. So in the early days it felt like there was a focus on more back office use cases. How do I move the collateral from my Japan regional branch to my whatever.

**[30:26] SPEAKER_02:** Business process improvements.

**[30:28] SPEAKER_03:** Business process improvements. And I felt that there eventually became a, and I think this started 2020, 2021 a shift for big corporations wanting top line use cases like Nike was the first to sell a ton of NFTs. And then you're seeing I think the digital asset treasuries are a kind of genius way for a token to the company doesn't have to IPO but there could be a token and there can be something that's that provides the traditional protections of equity that's publicly traded. And then you could just leave this part sort of where it was and somehow there's kind of a merger going on and you know this is creating good top line revenue for investment banks and et cetera. So is your sense.

**[31:27] SPEAKER_00:** That.

**[31:29] SPEAKER_03:** People want the efficiency to compete or are they starting to think about it as a new revenue line or transformed revenue line or something?

**[31:45] SPEAKER_00:** Well that's a billion trillion dollar question right there. I don't have the answer. What I could say is I see how I think if you look at operational optimization, it's more than that. If you capital flow more seamlessly, you make more money in a financial float. So the more you have a flow of your money easy, the more you're going to be able to make some because you're gonna unlock some capital improvements yet I think and from conversation I've seen and where the still don't have the golden to say hey that's gonna remix a little bit of all the different people and intermediaries and people working because if you. If you suddenly have something that is being done a much more efficient way. Well some different intermediates they might have to rethink the way of doing their business. This is not going to happen from one day to another. What I can say is that because we're going to have those new form of working with digital assets that's going to more being a golden era for opportunities to build pretty fantastic product and the people that understand pretty well the ethos of the Ethereum ecosystem and also blockchain in general and some operation in traditional finance and be able to bridge those two.

**[33:15] SPEAKER_02:** You.

**[33:15] SPEAKER_00:** You're going to be able to bring some amazing amazing product. And that's what we see a little bit more with convergence of Aave that is doing a collateral product with Horizon and unlocking you have Figure you have a Spicore. You have some how as. As we're going to have now some assets that are on chain that maybe you can loan and you can collateralize and you can borrow money and you can have some liquidity from in front of those assets while being the actual. And also I want to stress we do we say RWAs. RWAs. RWAs. There is a lot of we need probably to find some new language because.

**[33:54] SPEAKER_01:** There is you know how I feel about that. I think the RWA term is so broad.

**[33:59] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, this can be RWA. Yeah it does get. And I can also take a picture of my bank account and say hey this is a tokenization of my bank account. And so there is RWAs but most of them they actually kind of elaborate IOUs and not. And now we're moving towards more and more having some standards and things like the. It's the legal tent.

**[34:27] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah you want the native issue.

**[34:29] SPEAKER_00:** The token is the. Is the.

**[34:31] SPEAKER_02:** Is the.

**[34:32] SPEAKER_00:** Is the legal claim to the assets.

**[34:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[34:34] SPEAKER_00:** And that's when this happens and when focusing on that that's going to unlock some pretty incredible things because the.

**[34:44] SPEAKER_01:** Like the.

**[34:45] SPEAKER_00:** And you connect this with DeFi maybe with some you're gonna always need some form of AML KYC and everything. The DeFi. There's none for the last year. It's, they're probably going to have two of those but once you connect this I think that's going to be pretty incredible.

**[35:03] SPEAKER_01:** But how do the institutions feel about obviously as the head of the EEA and you feel strongly about Ethereum too, right? The Ethereum ecosystem broadly of L1. How do they feel about that? Do they see any other. You know Ripple has tried to attract that interest for a really long time. Are they kind of sold on Ethereum at this point or are they looking. Are they still kind of needing to be convinced?

**[35:31] SPEAKER_00:** I've heard several executives at presentations saying hey, Ethereum is the standard. EVM is the standard. This is the ecosystem. Having said that and as you know decision makers, they also want to make sure they keep the door open and not being locked. So they move progressively. 60% of the stablecoin issuance is on Ethereum I think probably 85 to 90% of all RWA. It's the same some similar statistics about DeFi activities that's Electric Capital. Yeah you can see the graph three times more than any other ecosystem in terms of builders and everything. So that's the most radiant and advanced ecosystem in terms of research on every facet. And so that they know, they recognize but it doesn't mean that we need to keep educating to keep right. Working with the EF for instance they've been incredible work for the last few months of really packaging the message in a better way that can be more digestible. But there's more some work for instance the protocol team, they're already addressing so many of the fear can have some different digital asset manager in financial institution. But how we bring that message to the right people, package it in a way that it's easy to understand. That's some of the work that is being done as we speak and that's going to really help continuing solidifying that dominance position. But to also answer your question some of those institutions they say hey we want to be multi-chain. We want to look at everything which I think it's absolutely fair and I would do the same if I were in their shoe. So. Okay, well they have some different assessment criteria and they say well we're going to take this chain, this chain, this chain, this chain and then we'll see.

**[37:22] SPEAKER_02:** I mean go back to beyond EVM. I mean you've obviously got competition between Ethereum and other EVM flavors. What is the competition outside of that? Because I know there's you've obviously got competition within that. But.

**[37:43] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[37:43] SPEAKER_03:** What do you hear?

**[37:44] SPEAKER_02:** Institutions doing non-EVM things as well.

**[37:48] SPEAKER_03:** Just Canton is around. I don't know what they're using. Do institutions use Solana at all? Well, I know, but does DA still have its own big proprietary ish stack?

**[38:00] SPEAKER_02:** It's not proprietary anymore, but it's. Yeah, well, Hedera. Using Hedera.

**[38:09] SPEAKER_03:** What do you hear?

**[38:09] SPEAKER_02:** Competitive.

**[38:11] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. Canton is probably the one, the most advanced in terms of connection with the rest of the ecosystem. And I would say not the rest, but the traditional finance they have, they have a way it's structured though. It's something I still don't completely understand. You can be a validator, have some tokens that they're going to exchange on some private market and so some form of revenue and then they have already that. It's a consortium. It's a Quorum V2, I would say. And they've been able to bring it into their ganabarance a lot of the different financial institutions.

**[38:53] SPEAKER_01:** So.

**[38:54] SPEAKER_00:** But once again, and if you ask me, I'm biased of course, but this is an ecosystem. Yes, the Canton code is open source and everything but. Well, you still building on a technology that is not super very there's not a lot of people, when are you going to be the CIO of a company and you need to have some maintenance or something. It's going to be what 20 guys in a country that can do this, some work on this. And so that's the way I look at this. But Solana, I'm not sure with the institution.

**[39:31] SPEAKER_03:** I don't hear anything institutional from Solana, but it seems popular nonetheless.

**[39:36] SPEAKER_01:** Oddly enough Ripple has been trying to do this for a long time, but I don't hear them brought up in the conversation that much.

**[39:43] SPEAKER_02:** Nobody ever used Ripple.

**[39:48] SPEAKER_00:** I've been in blockchain not as long as you guys, but really since 2019. And I spent almost four years at ChainSafe, very authentic builders crypto native protocol development and I've been to conferences with the engineers and I asked them in a very candid way say have you ever built on Ripple or on some of their. And I had conversation with the engineers at ChainSafe and we had some polls and we had some conversation in the Slack. I remember and no one really came up with some very smart.

**[40:24] SPEAKER_02:** Just got an infinite war chest for marketing. Well and lobbying.

**[40:29] SPEAKER_01:** I mean at one point one of the Siboses I went to years and years ago, right Ripple was supposed to have a huge booth and you know Swift decided oh they're too much of a competitor so they kicked them out. And this wasn't.

**[40:45] SPEAKER_03:** They were calling themselves the Swift killer.

**[40:48] SPEAKER_01:** Right. For a while they decided Ripple decided. You know what, we're just going to run our own conference in parallel with Sibos. They put a parallel conference and Vitalik was speaking at their conference and I.

**[41:03] SPEAKER_02:** Remember at the Ripple one.

**[41:04] SPEAKER_01:** At the Ripple one and I remember they had buses in from the Sibos like taking you to where their new conference was. And I remember seeing Vitalik ran across looking for this conference because it was in this new place and we were all trying to. For I remember waving him over here. So it's, quarter people still using Corda R3. Right.

**[41:32] SPEAKER_00:** It's been bought out by Selena. Corda is Selena now.

**[41:35] SPEAKER_02:** I don't think really. I don't think they would approach it in those terms. I think it's a partnership and a collaboration.

**[41:43] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[41:43] SPEAKER_00:** That we're not.

**[41:44] SPEAKER_02:** Absolutely. Absolutely. They weren't bought by.

**[41:47] SPEAKER_01:** Not, not part of. But yes, but I mean I will say we are using Fabric still.

**[41:55] SPEAKER_00:** Well yes, behind the scene Fabric is still very present. I think central banks and those type of more very close environment if even I'm not sure BIS we know Bank of International Settlements which is 40 different international banks that work together to optimize I would say the collaboration and exchange. But they had Project Agora that they started a couple of months ago. Those are institutions where it takes much longer time.

**[42:33] SPEAKER_02:** I think they're starting a new project.

**[42:36] SPEAKER_00:** That's not the same Agora but I would imagine maybe they were having some POCs before. I know some few central banks they run using Fabric the. It's probably Hyperledger Fabric.

**[42:48] SPEAKER_02:** You know probably the asbestos isn't it? It's just going to take years to work that out.

**[42:56] SPEAKER_01:** You need people in suits to. I will say I think we're almost at 45 minutes. Re's been very generous with this time. I think we asked do you have any final thoughts that you want to.

**[43:09] SPEAKER_00:** Share with actually on Fabric? I know IBM is working on a bridge between Fabric to main to. It's called Fabric X.

**[43:17] SPEAKER_02:** Okay.

**[43:18] SPEAKER_00:** To Ethereum so well you can see that online, right?

**[43:21] SPEAKER_02:** Well one of that big sell at New York Blockchain Week in 2018 was there was that EVM integration right that they did.

**[43:33] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah they did a channel or something.

**[43:36] SPEAKER_02:** Appreciate JS or whatever that they did do this munching together and that was using Burrow right because you've got the Burrow for before Besu and that was the continuation of that Eris DB Monax one you went. That was never mainnet compatible though. But there was that Go EVM within Hyperledger under the same licensing. So they could wham those together and I mean that's seven years ago. So yeah I'm sure that they need to have an even better EVM story these days.

**[44:21] SPEAKER_00:** So if to answer your question and EVM and Ethereum is really the standard as everyone that's what they're saying. You go through some different stages. You have the Chief Innovation Officer of Swift and some different.

**[44:37] SPEAKER_01:** Institutions they understand that they're that and that's that.

**[44:40] SPEAKER_00:** That's what they say. I was really everywhere I went on all those different panels. We had a panel at 8:30 on my permissionless various private network. It was hosted by Applied Blockchain, a member of the EEA. There was Citibank, Linux Foundation, Decentralized Trust, UBX and me and it was full. There were people standing up and there was the Swift Innovation Officers, some other banks that came to talk to us. So people they understand Ethereum is definitely seen as the standard and the place where you want to build because that's where you have access to the most liquidity, the most users the most vibrant DeFi ecosystem, which is something that is getting closer I think and say, well, maybe there is some way to make some money here. I don't know exactly how, but there is some potential. So I think the future is very bright for us and I think that.

**[45:38] SPEAKER_02:** Ties very nicely back to the start of the conversation and about the thoughts for the EEA and so on. Was something that Jeremy Millar said in the opening speech on the opening day.

**[45:50] SPEAKER_01:** Was.

**[45:52] SPEAKER_02:** Think of this as being like a router, an internet intranet. There's no reason why suitably modular code bases shouldn't serve all of these use cases, public and private. And what we did not want to happen was, and I remember being driven very much by this was saying let's not have arbitrarily different code bases for these different things because we can't be asked. Having that conversation and making the effort to try and bridge those worlds. And that was really coming from that Fabric and Corda competition of these big enterprises basically saw being told, you Ethereum guys have got to get your stuff together or we're going to get mandated to use this other stuff. And it doesn't matter what you want, it's the spending will have been spent and it's never coming back. So I think it's to my mind it's really superb to see where we are. That's what we were thinking. That was kind of the goal is that this can be a standard for everything. And yeah, things were immature and maybe you needed to be doing consortium chains and you needed to take these baby steps on the way and wait for the tech to catch up. But really it's this can be.

**[47:16] SPEAKER_03:** The answer for everything.

**[47:17] SPEAKER_02:** So yeah, and I think that's where.

**[47:19] SPEAKER_00:** We are and we're talking more and more, the Ethereum Foundation has done an incredible job. They have an enterprise team also they're having conversation with everyone and they can have they have access to all the different leaders. And this has been very pretty fantastic. And so the more we discuss about this and say, hey, there is no CEO of Ethereum, it's not a private company, there is no CEO of internet. They all use Linux, right? So that's that that's something that is catching up more and more and the more we're going, that's also the mission at what we do at EEA, going to have this conversation or doing events, bringing some people together from a few events that we do and we try to really mix DeFi traditional finance institution pure Ethereum players and have all those people talking together. That's how we make that moving forward.

**[48:09] SPEAKER_01:** Well on that note I think we'll wrap up but where can people find more about you and EEA?

**[48:16] SPEAKER_00:** Well the website is entethalliance.org we have the same handle on Twitter on LinkedIn. I'm also on LinkedIn and Twitter and try to post often some few articles and some insights and there's some more work that I'm going to put together in a couple of weeks around RWAs and everything and also always looking for some large institution that would like to collaborate on some writing pieces. Yeah so we can really put some thought leadership and helping explaining what's. What's being done and I think bridging the Ethereum world with traditional finance is also something that we're pretty excited to do in a couple of weeks.

**[48:59] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's awesome.

**[49:00] SPEAKER_00:** We'll be also in Singapore Fintech week next month in Devcon in Argentina and we'll be also in Abu Dhabi for finance week.

**[49:09] SPEAKER_01:** Cool. And Bob, where can people find you?

**[49:12] SPEAKER_02:** So yeah I'm on Twitter Sam's my name Bob Summerwill with a W I L L not Vil not Tom O Will.

**[49:22] SPEAKER_01:** Not the German spelling Karen K.

**[49:26] SPEAKER_03:** James Lubin on X YouTube etc and.

**[49:32] SPEAKER_01:** You can find me on X at vicvic the number 4 w o n G thank you for joining us for our first in person roundtable. Thanks again. That's awesome. Thanks for coming. Take care.

**[49:47] SPEAKER_00:** That was pretty cool to be in Bush week again.
