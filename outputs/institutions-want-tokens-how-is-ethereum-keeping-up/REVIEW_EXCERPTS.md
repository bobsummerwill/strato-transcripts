**Intermediate:**

> I use Restream. We try to use something and it streams on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time. So we're using StreamYard too. We're using StreamYard and I'm just double checking. We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit... Not all perfect, yeah. Yeah. I'll share the one. I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one is pretty cool. Pretty great. Because you're thinking, there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Isn't there just an answer that just works? But the thing is, those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind. They don't like it. They want to track you in. Yeah, exactly. X especially. So that's against our vision. On X, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah, it's... Why would you want to download it? You know, like that's something, you know, I guess the next step in maybe like... You want to use it somewhere else? Are you seeing somebody else? Be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms. Even own a query or just access, you know. Something I love about Google is like I can go, I can activate, you know, like the tracking, you know. But at least I can go in and say, what did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have like thousands of data, but they don't even share it with you. Yeah, exactly. I find it quite, quite well.

**Intermediate:**

> well i think clients i i think it was even beyond that like there was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company's siloed to get i think like a theorem to do what they wanted to do in a private way yeah so everyone was like holding on these things and what came out of that those early conversations at devcon was wait like while doing similar things maybe if we all kind of work together we could do it faster and get this up faster and that was all around private everyone and i guess also like a marriage between like

Maybe if we all kind of work together we could do it faster and get this up faster. And that was all around private Ethereum. And I guess also like a marriage between like...

**Intermediate:**

> isn't a payments mechanism, right? No, it's a message. That's another comment. So let me, I think, interject with a specific example. I think they're biggest in FX, right? Yes. So let's say I've got some USD, I want some Euro. And we kind of like agree to a USD Euro trade. And so we like, I guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at. And I think it's like, I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to Swift. And you do too. And then Swift checks if it matches. It charges $7 either way. If it does match, then it'll tell us that it matched. Well, I don't think it's actually exactly this way.

**Intermediate:**

> It's not proprietary anymore, but it's, yeah. Well, Hedera. No one using Hedera. What are you here? Competitive. Kenton is probably the one, the most advanced in terms of like, you know, connection with the rest of the ecosystem. And I would say that not the rest, but the traditional finance. They have, they have like a way it's structured though. It's, It's something I still don't completely understand. You can be a validator, have some tokens that you can exchange on some private market. And so some form of revenue. And then they have already like that. It's a consortium, you know, like it's a quorum B2, I would say. And they've been able to bring into their governance like a lot of the different financial institutions. So, but then once again, And if you ask me, and I'm biased, of course, but this is an ecosystem. He has a Canton code. He's open source and everything. But, well, you're still building on a technology that is not super very, there's not a lot of people. When are you going to be the CIO of a company and you need to have some maintenance or something? It's going to be, what, like 20 guys in a country that can do some work on this? And so that's the way I look at this.

It's not much, you know, like the people, like they're going to be some, you know, corresponding banking that's going to be like locally taking your cash and they're going to, everyone is going to take their share.
