**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** I use Restream. We try to use something and it streams on X, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

**[00:10] SPEAKER_03:** So we’re using StreamYard too. We’re using StreamYard and I’m just double-checking.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_01:** We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit… not all perfect. Yeah.

**[00:26] SPEAKER_00:** I’ll share the one. I don’t know if you’ve tried this one, but this one looks pretty cool. Pretty great.

**[00:31] SPEAKER_01:** Because you’re thinking, there must be good software for this, right? It’s such a common need. Isn’t there just an answer that just works?

**[00:39] SPEAKER_00:** But the thing is, those platforms, they’re not built with interoperability in mind. They don’t like it. They want to lock you in. Yeah, exactly. X especially. That’s against our vision. On X, there isn’t even a means to download the bloody audio. It’s… why would you want to download it? You know, like that’s something… I guess the next step is maybe like, you want to use it somewhere else? Are you seeing somebody else? Being able to own your data, in all those platforms. Even owning a query or just access. Something I love about Google is like, I can go, I can activate the tracking, but at least I can go in and say, “What did you do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store.” It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have thousands of data points, but they don’t even share it with you.

**[01:31] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, exactly.

**[01:33] SPEAKER_00:** I find it quite… quite… well. 501.

**[01:39] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, yeah.

**[01:40] SPEAKER_03:** We are live. So we are live. No, no, no, I’m ready. No, but that was a good call-in show, right? So we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for “Janjoo Live” in real life.

**[01:57] SPEAKER_01:** In the same room. In the same room. Amazing.

**[02:00] SPEAKER_03:** And you are a special guest. Do you want to show?

**[02:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Redwan Meslen. Yes, Meslen, who is the executive director of the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years. Healthy run.

**[02:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly.

**[02:23] SPEAKER_01:** So, yeah. It’s eight years now. Since 2017, yeah. February 2017 was the launch date, on the 28th.

**[02:31] SPEAKER_02:** There was pre-work solidly before, at least three months, maybe more.

**[02:34] SPEAKER_01:** There were meetings I was part of in December and January. Those were the first big meetings with whatever, 30, 40 people. Crazy amounts. But yeah, it really started probably at DevCon 2, really. It did. Those were the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

**[02:57] SPEAKER_02:** There was the kickoff meeting at the J.P. Morgan office, which was pretty big. There were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft.

**[03:07] SPEAKER_01:** Right. So that public launch was February. But December, there was an internal one, and then J.P. Morgan…

**[03:16] SPEAKER_03:** …was in January 2017. But yeah, a lot of those initial contacts happened at DevCon 2, in October the previous year. Well, in DevCon 2. Oh yes. So basically, there was a lot of conversation there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. There were a lot of interested parties. The group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at a Starbucks just off-site. That was sort of the idea formation thing.

**[03:58] SPEAKER_01:** And then Matt, from NewCo, held a little bar side event as well, which we have some technical issues…

**[04:15] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, okay. Hold on a second. I’m just going to push James to tell everybody to go to YouTube.

**[04:20] SPEAKER_01:** We have a technical issue, everybody.

**[04:22] SPEAKER_03:** I will fix that. Oh, did I… I messed up the X. You did a bad one. Yeah, I did a bad one. So everyone, please join us on YouTube.

**[04:33] SPEAKER_02:** Space is at 5 a.m.

**[04:34] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[04:35] SPEAKER_02:** Yes.

**[04:36] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, Matt spoke, held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to. There were various others there. I don’t know if you went to that one as well.

**[04:45] SPEAKER_03:** I didn’t go to that one. So I think the main thing was that, yeah… I’m going to try and fix this right now on X. Live technical support. See if I can resolve it right now.

**[05:02] SPEAKER_01:** If not, I am.

**[05:06] SPEAKER_03:** I did choose a…

**[05:08] SPEAKER_01:** But also parallel in that, because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise stuff. That’s right. So at some point, he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was not quite the same group. It was a larger group, slightly different. NewCo was part of that, Luca was part of that. Also, by the way, we should introduce ourselves. Yeah, I’m Bob Summerwill. So I’m head of ecosystem at STRATO at BlockApps.

**[05:56] SPEAKER_02:** Kieren James-Lubin, CEO of BlockApps. Victor Wong, creators of STRATO.

**[06:01] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, and Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer of BlockApps.

**[06:04] SPEAKER_02:** That’s it. Sorry, back. But yeah, Amos as well. Do you remember that? Yeah. Taiwan. Taiwan. We should check in on… I haven’t thought of Amos in several years until the moment.

**[06:16] SPEAKER_01:** So the interesting thing about what they were doing, that was like some Taiwan bank consortium thing. Yep. But then they did work on Chinese cryptography and stuff like that, because you’ve got differing requirements. Right. And Masterchain, which was in Russia, that was like a Sberbank thing. Yeah.

**[06:42] SPEAKER_00:** Because you have… I was not at the EEA at that time, so it’s very interesting for me: what were the hopes and the excitement? You were part of those early conversations when this was created. I think companies… it was a pretty big event, as you mentioned, J.P. Morgan and everything, all those big names coming into the ecosystem. What were the hopes and the overall atmosphere when the EEA was created eight years ago?

**[07:13] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, well, I mean, ConsenSys were very critical as well because they were doing a load of the enterprise engagement stuff, right? You’ve got many, many companies starting to get interested in “Hey, we want to do a pilot. We want to get involved.” ConsenSys were doing a lot of that, so they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together. Over those months, you had a hell of a lot of momentum. Really, really quick.

**[07:48] SPEAKER_02:** So the observation during DevCon 2 when the idea was hatched was basically that, at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had hacked their own consensus algorithms and security and… Many gists. Many gists, indeed. We learned later that a lot of J.P. Morgan’s Quorum was initially built by Jeff Wilcke.

**[08:19] SPEAKER_01:** He had like some kind of… and that was not announced at the time of DevCon 2. That was still behind the scenes for a few months, but it happened just before the EEA started. But yeah, you’ve got all of this stuff brewing up for years earlier. If you think of ErisDB that became Monax, that became Hyperledger Burrow: that was a permissioned Ethereum client off PoC5, pre-mainnet, mid-2014, of sticking Tendermint onto an EVM. So, yeah, it was all a bit smushed apart. But the time was right for us to work together because we’ve all got the same needs.

**[09:07] SPEAKER_02:** Us too. We had our own client, and it got used in a bunch of the ConsenSys consulting engagements at that time. We started even then tuning it for enterprise. So I guess the idea was: maybe enterprises won’t adopt if there isn’t a standard for all of this new stuff that they need that’s above and beyond the base standard.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_03:** I think it was even beyond that. There was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company’s silo to get Ethereum to do what they wanted to do in a private way. So everyone was bolting on these things. What came out of those early conversations at DevCon was: wait, while doing similar things, maybe if we all work together we could do it faster, and get this up faster. That was all around privacy, and I guess also like a marriage between…

**[10:11] SPEAKER_01:** …customers of these things and builders. You’ve got all these startup companies that are making Ethereum things, and you’ve obviously got big demand from major enterprises to have this. But on that standardization side, there was nothing. You’re all going to get vendor-locked instantly, and it’ll all just be arbitrarily different and painful and horrible. So let’s try and work out… At some point as well with Quorum, it was kind of like, are we going to collaboratively do codebases as well? Hyperledger was another piece into this. A few months earlier, I’d spent a bunch of time working on relicensing the C++ client back to Apache 2.0 so it could have been contributed into Hyperledger and we could have gathered around that. That fucked up. So the EEA was kind of a backup, I guess, of like, right, we can’t have this grand fusion, but there’s enough happening on the Ethereum side that we can at least get all the Ethereum pieces together. And then, yeah, I guess it went quite quickly from “Okay, we don’t want to straight compete with Hyperledger.” Having a shared codebase also kind of screws up the companies.

**[11:41] SPEAKER_02:** So I think, in the spirit of spiciness, the enterprise users would have preferred a shared codebase, and they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor-locked again. They’ve had these horrific IBM nightmares, Oracle nightmares over the years. And they’re just like, “Not this time. We’re not going to live through this.”

**[12:10] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, also, you’ve got that market pressure, right, of Corda coming out, of IBM launching Fabric.

**[12:19] SPEAKER_02:** They were worried it would end up nominally open source, but quite proprietary.

**[12:24] SPEAKER_01:** So those were both shooting for release in February 2017. So it’s that kind of timeline: right, we’ve got to get our shit together to be able to do an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM and R3.

**[12:40] SPEAKER_02:** At that time, I remember one of our prominent enterprise user EEA members said, “Yeah, they’ve got a call with 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks,” let’s say. Right. And it’s funny that Ethereum just survived all of this more or less not paying any attention, and this competition kind of came in.

**[13:08] SPEAKER_03:** Well, I think there was another parallel thing happening. At that DevCon event, there really were the first enterprise use cases we talk about today. For example, Santander talked about US dollars on-chain, which we all recognize as a stablecoin now.

**[13:31] SPEAKER_00:** But you see, Victor, I think that’s a very cool parallel. You set the stage pretty well for where it’s coming from, and where it started. You mentioned innovation labs starting to contribute to some code. We’ve known the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. But it’s only actually now—and it’s been for probably the last year—that things have been really changing drastically. And to take your words for when you say innovation labs: it’s not innovation lab anymore looking at how they implement blockchain in their ecosystem. It’s really the executive team that says, “Hey, we want a plan. What is production? How do we get it to market?”

**[14:16] SPEAKER_02:** Thankfully, they’re scared now.

**[14:18] SPEAKER_00:** So they better move or… I don’t know. But there was some interesting talk when we were at Sibos, the SWIFT conference.

**[14:28] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, we should mention that. You were just at Sibos and you’re dealing with what we think of as TradFi institutional players, and that’s where you have a lot of communication. What were your impressions about where they’re at with that? Because that’s the other side that we talk about: digital asset tokenization is definitely a hot topic everyone is looking at…

**[14:55] SPEAKER_00:** They know it’s happening. They want to be involved. And now especially there is less regulatory… The listeners may not know what Sibos is.

**[15:06] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, yeah.

**[15:07] SPEAKER_00:** So Sibos is the big SWIFT conference. SWIFT, if you’re not familiar, it’s a messaging system that a lot of 11,000 financial institutions around the world use. It’s actually a co-op. It’s a DAO for TradFi.

**[15:26] SPEAKER_02:** Although it’s like, can we buy in now? I feel like it’s not…

**[15:29] SPEAKER_03:** Kudos to Danielle from ConsenSys who said that to me once. It is a DAO.

**[15:34] SPEAKER_00:** The token is having probably a bank license.

**[15:38] SPEAKER_02:** The London Metal Exchange is like this too. It’s like: you want to sign up, you got to buy a bunch of shares, then there’s an annual fee and whatnot. And you have to put someone there all the time.

**[15:49] SPEAKER_01:** You have to join the trade guild.

**[15:51] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly. And so that big conference is a big meetup of payments, I would say, every year. So you have all the big financial institutions, also global financial institutions like clearing houses, settlements, like Euroclear, etc. But also all the banks. They gather there and there is a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually Sibos and SWIFT is a very kind of standard organization, because what they do is: how do we make sure we send messages across all of us that everyone is sure is going to understand? They used to have a different kind of messaging format, and recently now they’re migrating to something new, which is ISO 20022, which is… if you want to go and dive deeper into this, this is really how every financial institution wants to communicate. They’ve been working on that spec for a long time. That’s how anything that can touch finance—from securities to payment—has to be codified.

**[16:54] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I think it’s good to explain. Most of finance gets cleared through messaging. Crypto people are used to putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere.

**[17:06] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[17:07] SPEAKER_02:** It’s not really like this.

**[17:08] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, yes. Thank you. Indeed. That’s a very key point: that process of what we call delivery versus payment in traditional finance. It’s a pretty complex thing because how do you make sure when you deliver the money, the money has been received; that you receive the asset; that everything has been… It’s a lot of dance: you receive a message, you send another one. It’s not like crypto where we submit and it’s an atomic transaction, which is just one thing. When the transaction is complete, you know it’s been executed, it’s been delivered, and all the parties… It’s actually: I give you the can, I know you’ve been giving me the money. Where actually there is a little dance: I put the can here, you see the can has been moving here, you send the money. So the blockchain offers such efficiencies because things that were like T+1 or T+2 for some exchanges, now you do it—depending on what chain you deploy—between a second to even less than that. And also, SWIFT…

**[18:21] SPEAKER_02:** …isn’t a payments mechanism, right? No, it’s not. It’s a message. Let me interject with this specific example. I think they’re biggest in FX, right?

**[18:31] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[18:32] SPEAKER_02:** So let’s say I’ve got some USD, I want some euro, and we agree to a USD/EUR trade. We look up whatever the pair is trading at. I think it’s like I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to SWIFT, and you do too, and then SWIFT checks if it matches, it charges $7 either way. If it does match, then it’ll tell us that it matched.

**[19:04] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I don’t think it’s exactly this way. It’s more: SWIFT offers a type of envelope, a format of envelope and paper and ink that we know how to use, and how we’re supposed to fill up some forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants. It’s not moving the asset. There’s corresponding banking that’s going to be locally taking your cash, and everyone is going to take their share.

**[19:31] SPEAKER_02:** It’s not moving the asset. It’s like: I have the USD on my bank’s list. You’ve got the euro on your bank’s list.

**[19:40] SPEAKER_00:** Talking to each other in a secure and compliant way. Because it’s also: he sent that, you have to send some specific messaging for compliance. Then I send another one: “Hey, I checked, there’s all the information.”

**[19:54] SPEAKER_01:** A bunch of local jurisdiction-specific… Yeah, it’s like a lot of different handshakes.

**[20:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I think the way someone described it to me: it’s sort of like what they’re doing is tracking the transfers, but no money is actually moving. And then they have a list of IOUs. So when I send a SWIFT transaction from, let’s say I send $100 to you in France and I go to my bank, I put in $100, the money doesn’t…

**[20:27] SPEAKER_00:** …go anywhere. They just… oh yeah. So my debit/credit has to write the USD off the net at the end of the day. RTGS is going to do the transfer actually. Exactly. That’s a different messaging. If you research—and I’m not a SWIFT expert, but I had to learn that the last couple of months, I’ve done a little bit more deep dive—it’s fascinating because there is such a huge dance between a transfer of money. Because you have the money in your bank account, but then actually central bank money, then you have deposit money. So those, what you call M0, M1, M2. And so all of that is pretty complex. And then we’re just talking about payments here. Securities and those other financial instruments that you can exchange also using blockchain in a very efficient way. But using stablecoins, you can make everything super simple. And also one misconception maybe I would love to mention: we talked about stablecoins and CBDCs…

**[21:26] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[21:27] SPEAKER_00:** They’re actually exactly the same thing, but just in a different context. A CBDC is a stablecoin for a central bank.

**[21:36] SPEAKER_01:** It’s just the issuer.

**[21:37] SPEAKER_00:** It’s just the issuer is not the same. We’re never going to really touch CBDCs because this is like the money of banks, if you say. But almost, from a technical level, it’s almost like a copy-paste of the same contract mechanism. But we create a whole different language and terminology for that. They’re very similar. And funny fact: those CBDCs, they’ve been doing… the baby needed to grow. Like you said, DevCon 2: Ethereum was like a two-year-old kid. And we were like, “Hey, come in here. You can manage the most critical infrastructure of the planet, which is our money and how we do trade.” And I think the Ethereum Foundation—I have to give them credit—did the right thing, because they protected that baby so it could grow. Now we’re at an age where it’s more mature. It’s more than 10 years. It’s still not even a teenager. The analogy with humans has limits. But we are at a point now where we have a technology, and Ethereum has the capacity to answer all the challenges that are facing institutions, which is scalability, privacy, composability, and interoperability. The four points that you had in the ARC paper from Circle. And now we have this. Just last week, zkSync announced up to 15,000 TPS, and there is something new almost every week. Now the technology, when institutions look at it: “I need to make sure this is private. I need to make sure this is going to be executed in a seamless way.” Also decentralization, it’s more about the way they look at it: vendor lock-in. I would say the best analogy is that you want to make sure the infrastructure you rely on is going to be able to absorb your activity, but also be resilient enough. We still have some work, because I understand the perspective of institutions deploying on a public infrastructure. At first, when Wikipedia showed up 20, 25 years ago, I remember I was at my engineering college. I was at the board and we were talking about having a wiki for doing some articles. And the academic guy said, “This is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. Anyone can put any information. It’s not trustworthy.”

**[24:35] SPEAKER_03:** You are French.

**[24:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. You’re allowed to, you’re allowed to. But they were in French, they were very… protecting this. At that time, they said, “We cannot trust something that’s being built collectively like this.” But now we know you have to take it with a grain of salt, but it’s actually much more accepted. Those are reliable sources of information. And you can have things that are being built publicly that are actually very resilient.

**[25:03] SPEAKER_03:** There’s always this gap between what traditional institutions understand about… We all understand what’s been capable for a really long time, but are there still gaps? Or do you think that’s been closed now? Even if the capability is there, there’s still a knowledge gap sometimes.

**[25:31] SPEAKER_00:** Well, let me put it this way. If you combine all the different types of money, there’s about $123 trillion of cash around the world. $300 billion are on-chain. So the numbers talk for themselves: we’re very early. I think we still have a lot of work to do in terms of education. But by education, I mean really talking from a product perspective: what business problem can I solve for you, how it’s going to be done, what is going to be the maintenance after, how you’re going to deal with very specific use cases. You can have some teams that already have an understanding of what you can achieve, but we still need to provide, as an ecosystem, more structure: who you can work with, the different vendors, what services they can do, where they can help, what’s the type of contract you’re going to have after, and giving that overall perspective for a new entrant in the market. Some of them understand very well and have detailed questions, even asking me, “Redwan, we need to increase the contract size from the 24 to 40, 48 kilobytes,” and we have some well-known issues, like the Solidity “stack too deep” problem. So there are some of them that are like this. But then some other ones, they’re going to ask me: “Why should I go on an L2? What is the L1? What does it mean? What about those changes? What are the primitives?” Explaining: if you build on any L2s, you’re actually going to choose maybe one vendor in some way. But you can completely move your assets freely among the ecosystem. The wallets are going to be the same. A lot of things are going to be equivalent, you don’t have to rebuild.

**[27:28] SPEAKER_03:** Mm-hmm.

**[27:29] SPEAKER_00:** So you need to explain. Some people are going to say, “This is scammy.” You can find all the layers. But now people also see the potential of what you can do with digital assets, tokenization. And people were a little bit looking around. I’m very excited to see what’s going to happen in the next 6 to 12 months. Because the GENIUS Act was signed July 15 or something like this. The CLARITY Act, I think, is still a little bit ongoing. Now we hear companies from every direction say: “Okay, how are we going to implement this?” The fintechs are also moving. Even if they’re building their L1, I wish they would do some L2s, and my door will always be open when you want to consider that there is a pretty great tool that can help. But that’s going to push the market from financial institutions to really adopting this. There is an organization like DTCC, the biggest clearinghouse in the world. All the securities in the world basically are being cleared over there. They released an incredible product four months ago in April, “The Great Collateral,” where they have a collection of hundreds of smart contracts that allows you to clear and to make margin calls and collateral management from different jurisdictions, which is a fantastic use case. I’m not a collateral management expert, but I understand the value of how this unlocks. You actually have something you can take from your bank in Japan that you’re going to post for something in the US because you have a market event. This is something you would not even imagine before. And now you can do it. It’s compliant. It’s legal. That can unlock so much efficiency. In the next few months, that’s going to be a huge game changer.

**[29:39] SPEAKER_03:** So it sounds like the lid has been lifted off and there’s a ton of demand, but walking down the path to supply that demand is the part people are figuring out. Is that right?

**[29:52] SPEAKER_00:** I think it’s such a transformative technology for how those businesses operate. There is also: how am I going to make money?

**[30:02] SPEAKER_03:** Okay. So there’s a fear element to it, right?

**[30:07] SPEAKER_00:** It’s like, well, now I can have… I’m a PSP provider…

**[30:13] SPEAKER_02:** Let me ask you this. In the early days, it felt like there was a focus on more back-office use cases. Like, yeah, how do I move the collateral from my Japan regional branch to my whatever. Business process improvements. And I felt that there eventually became, I think this started like 2020, 2021, a shift for big corporations wanting top-line use cases. Like Nike was the first to sell a ton of NFTs. And then you’re seeing digital asset treasuries as a kind of genius way for a token: the company doesn’t have to IPO, but there could be a token, and there can be something that provides the traditional protections of equity that’s publicly traded. And then you could just leave this part sort of where it was, and somehow there’s kind of like a merger going on. This is creating good top-line revenue for investment banks, etc. So is your sense that people want the efficiency to compete, or are they starting to think about it as a new revenue line, or a transformed revenue line, or something?

**[31:45] SPEAKER_00:** Well, that’s a billion, trillion dollar question right there. I don’t have the answer. What I could say is: I see how operational optimization is more than that. If capital flows more seamlessly, you make more money in a financial flow. The more you have a flow of your money that’s easy, the more you’re going to unlock opportunities and capital improvements. From conversations I’ve seen, they still don’t have the golden “do” that says, “Hey, that’s going to…” But it’s going to remix a little bit all the different people and intermediaries because if you suddenly have something being done in a much more efficient way, some intermediaries might have to rethink the way they do their business. This is not going to happen from one day to another. What I can say is that because we’re going to have those new forms of working with digital assets, that’s going to be a golden era of opportunities to build fantastic products. People that understand the ethos of the Ethereum ecosystem and blockchain in general, and also understand traditional finance operations, and can bridge those two: you’re going to be able to bring amazing products. That’s what we see more with convergence, of Aave doing a collateral product with Horizon, and… you have Figure, you have other examples. As we have assets on-chain, maybe you can loan them, collateralize, borrow money, have liquidity in front of those assets while being the action. And also, I want to stress: we say RWAs, RWAs, RWAs—there is a lot of… We probably need to find some new language.

**[33:57] SPEAKER_03:** I think the RWA term is so broad.

**[33:59] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, we need… This can be an RWA. Yeah, exactly. And I can also take a picture of my bank account and say, “Hey, this is a tokenization of my bank account.” So there are all these ways, but most of them are elaborate IOUs. Now we’re moving towards having standards and things like the legal intent. You want native issuance: the token is the legal claim to the asset. When this happens, and when focusing on that, that’s going to unlock incredible things. You connect this with DeFi—you’re going to need AML, KYC and everything. DeFi as we’ve known for the last year, they’re probably going to have two of those. But once you connect this, that’s going to be pretty incredible.

**[35:03] SPEAKER_03:** But how do the institutions feel about… obviously as the head of the EEA, and you feel strongly about Ethereum, right? The Ethereum ecosystem broadly—L1, L2s. How do they feel about that? Do they see any other… Ripple has tried to attract that interest for a really long time. Are they sold on Ethereum at this point, or are they still needing to be convinced?

**[35:31] SPEAKER_00:** I’ve heard several executives at Sibos saying, “Ethereum is the standard. The EVM is the standard. This is the ecosystem.” Having said that, as decision makers, they also want to keep the door open and not be locked, so they move progressively. You know, 60% of stablecoin issuance is on Ethereum. I think probably 85 to 90% of all RWAs is the same. Similar statistics about DeFi activity. Electric Capital: you can see a graph, three times more than any other ecosystem in terms of builders and everything. So that’s the most vibrant and advanced ecosystem in terms of research on every facet. They recognize that. But it doesn’t mean we don’t need to keep educating, and keep working with the Ethereum Foundation. They’ve done incredible work for the last few months of packaging the message in a better way that can be more digestible. But there’s more work: the protocol team is already addressing so many of the fears you can have from a digital asset manager in a financial institution. But how we bring that message to the right people, package it in a way that’s easy to understand—that’s work being done as we speak. That’s going to help solidify that dominance position. But to also answer your question, some institutions say, “Hey, we want to be multi-chain, we want to look at everything,” which I think is absolutely fair. I would do the same if I were in their shoes. So they have some assessment criteria and they say, “We’re going to take this chain, this chain, this chain,” and then we’ll see.

**[37:32] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, go beyond EVM. You’ve obviously got competition between Ethereum and other EVM flavors. What is the competition outside of that? Because I know you’ve got competition within that. But are institutions doing non-EVM things as well?

**[37:49] SPEAKER_02:** There’s Canton around. I don’t know what they’re using. Do institutions use Solana at all? I know—does the EEA still have its own big proprietary-ish stack?

**[38:01] SPEAKER_01:** It’s not proprietary anymore, but yeah. Well, Hedera. No one using Hedera.

**[38:09] SPEAKER_00:** What are you hearing? Competitive: Canton is probably the most advanced in terms of connection with the rest of the ecosystem. Not the rest, but traditional finance. It’s structured though. It’s something I still don’t completely understand. You can be a validator, have some tokens that you can exchange on some private market, and some form of revenue. And then they have already like that. It’s a consortium, like a Quorum v2, I would say. And they’ve been able to bring into their governance a lot of different financial institutions. But once again—and if you ask me, and I’m biased, of course—this is an ecosystem. Canton code is open source and everything. But you’re still building on a technology that is not super… there are not a lot of people. When you’re going to be the CIO of a company and you need maintenance, it’s going to be what, like 20 guys in a country that can do work on this? That’s the way I look at it. Solana, I’m not sure, for institutions.

**[39:31] SPEAKER_02:** I don’t hear anything institutional from Solana, but it seems popular nonetheless.

**[39:36] SPEAKER_03:** Oddly enough, Ripple has been trying to do this for a long time, but I don’t hear them brought up in the conversation that much.

**[39:43] SPEAKER_01:** Nobody ever used Ripple.

**[39:46] SPEAKER_00:** I’ve been in blockchain not as long as you guys, but really since 2019. I spent almost four years at ChainSafe. Very authentic builders, crypto-native protocol development. I’ve been to conferences with engineers and I asked them in a candid way: “Have you ever built on Ripple or some other?” I had conversations with the engineers at ChainSafe. We had some polls and conversations in Slack, I remember.

**[40:20] SPEAKER_01:** And no one really came up with some very…

**[40:23] SPEAKER_03:** Just got an infinite war chest for marketing and lobbying.

**[40:29] SPEAKER_03:** I mean, at one point, one of the Sibos I went to years and years ago, Ripple was supposed to have a huge booth. And I guess SWIFT decided, “Oh, they’re too much of a competitor,” so they kicked them out.

**[40:44] SPEAKER_02:** They were calling themselves the SWIFT killer. Right.

**[40:50] SPEAKER_03:** They decided, Ripple decided, “You know what? We’re just going to run our own conference in parallel with Sibos.” They put on a parallel conference. And Vitalik was speaking at their conference.

**[41:06] SPEAKER_02:** At the Ripple one?

**[41:08] SPEAKER_03:** At the Ripple one. And I remember they had buses in front of the Sibos conference, taking you to where their conference was. And I remember seeing Vitalik run across, looking for this conference, because it was in this new place and we were all trying to… I remember waving him: “Over here!”

**[41:25] SPEAKER_00:** Is people still using Corda, actually? It’s been bought out by… Corda and Selena, “Corda Selena.”

**[41:35] SPEAKER_01:** I don’t think they would say “bought out.” I think it’s a partnership and a collaboration. So no, they weren’t bought by…

**[41:47] SPEAKER_03:** Not bought out, but yes. I mean, I will say…

**[41:52] SPEAKER_01:** Anyone using Fabric still? Fabric?

**[41:55] SPEAKER_00:** Well, yes. Behind the scenes, Fabric is still very present. I think central banks and those type of very closed environments. I’m not sure. BIS, Bank for International Settlements—which is, for those who don’t know, it’s like 40 different international banks that work together to optimize the collaboration and exchange—they had a project, Agora, that they started a couple of months ago. Those are institutions where it takes much longer time, I think.

**[42:25] SPEAKER_03:** That’s dancing in new projects? That’s not the same Agora, but I would imagine maybe they were having POCs before.

**[42:34] SPEAKER_00:** I know a few central banks, they run using Fabric.

**[42:46] SPEAKER_01:** It’s probably like asbestos, isn’t it? It’s just going to take years to get out.

**[42:56] SPEAKER_03:** You need people in suits to support them. I will say, I think we’re almost at 45 minutes. Everyone’s been very generous with this time. Do you have any final thoughts you want to share?

**[43:10] SPEAKER_00:** Actually on Fabric: I know IBM is working on a bridge between Fabric to Ethereum. It’s called “Fabric X.” You can see that online.

**[43:21] SPEAKER_01:** Right. Well, one of their big sell at New York Blockchain Week in 2018 was their EVM integration. They did the… channel or whatever, they did do this bunching together. That was using Burrow, right? Because Burrow went into Hyperledger for… and that was the continuation of that. ErisDB, Monax, onward. That was never mainnet-compatible, though. But there was that Go EVM within Hyperledger under the same licensing, so they could wham those together. That’s seven years ago. So yeah, I’m sure they need to have an even better EVM story these days.

**[44:21] SPEAKER_00:** To answer your question: EVM and Ethereum is really the standard, as everyone says. That’s what they’re saying. You go through different stages. You have the chief innovation officer of SWIFT and different institutions—they understand that. That’s what they say. Everywhere I went on different panels… We had a panel at 8:30 on permissionless versus private networks. It was hosted by Applied Blockchain, a member of the EEA. There was Citibank, Linux Foundation, Decentralized Trust, UBIX, and me. It was full. There were people standing up. The SWIFT innovation officers and other banks came to talk to us. People understand. Ethereum is definitely seen as the standard and the place where you want to build because that’s where you have access to the most liquidity, the most users, the most vibrant DeFi ecosystem, which is something that is getting closer, I think, and people say, “Well, maybe there is some way to make some money here.” I don’t know exactly how, but there is potential. So I think the future is very bright for us.

**[45:38] SPEAKER_01:** And I think that ties very nicely back to the start of the conversation, and about the thoughts for the EEA and so on. It was something that Jeremy Millar said in the opening speech on the opening day: think of this as being like a router, an internet/intranet. There’s no reason why suitably modular codebases shouldn’t serve all of these use cases, public and private. And what we did not want to happen—and I remember being driven very much by this—was saying: let’s not have arbitrarily different codebases for these different things because we can’t be asked having that conversation and making the effort to bridge those worlds. And that was really coming from that Fabric and Corda competition, of these big enterprises basically saying, “Ethereum guys have got to get your stuff together or we’re going to get mandated to use this other stuff.” And it doesn’t matter what you want: the spending will have been spent, and it’s never coming back. So to my mind, it’s superb to see where we are. That was the goal, right? This can be a standard for everything. Things were immature and maybe you needed consortium chains and you needed to take baby steps and wait for the tech to catch up. But really: this can be the answer for everything. And I think that’s where we are.

**[47:10] SPEAKER_00:** We’re talking more and more. Ethereum Foundation has done an incredible job. They have an enterprise team also that’s in conversation with everyone. They have access to different leaders. That has been pretty fantastic. The more we discuss this and say, “Hey, there is no CEO of Ethereum. It’s not a private company. There’s no CEO of the internet.” Yeah, it was Linux, right? That’s something catching up more and more. And the more we go, that’s also the mission of the EEA: having this conversation, doing events, bringing people together. From a few events that we do, we try to remix DeFi, traditional finance institutions, pure Ethereum players, and have all those people talking together. That’s how we move forward.

**[48:09] SPEAKER_03:** Well, on that note, I think we’ll wrap up. Where can people find more about you and the EEA in general?

**[48:17] SPEAKER_00:** The website. We are present on all the social media. The website is entethalliance.org. We have the same handle on X, on LinkedIn. I’m also on LinkedIn and X and try to post often some articles and insights. There’s some more work that I’m going to put together in a couple of weeks around RWAs and everything. And also always looking for some large institution that would like to collaborate on some writing pieces. So we can put some thought leadership and help explain what’s being done, and bridge the Ethereum world with traditional finance, which is something we’re excited to do in the coming weeks. We’ll be also at Singapore FinTech Week next month, at DevCon in Argentina, and we’ll be also in Abu Dhabi for Finance Week.

**[49:09] SPEAKER_03:** Cool.

**[49:10] SPEAKER_01:** And Bob, where can people find you? So, yeah, I’m on X, same as my name: Bob Summerwill, with a W-I-L-L, not “-ville,” not “Summerville.”

**[49:22] SPEAKER_03:** Not the German spelling.

**[49:23] SPEAKER_01:** No.

**[49:24] SPEAKER_03:** Kieren?

**[49:26] SPEAKER_02:** Kieren James-Lubin on X, YouTube, et cetera.

**[49:31] SPEAKER_03:** And you can find me on X at Vic, V-I-C, the number four, W-O-N-G. Thank you for joining us for our first in-person roundtable.

**[49:43] SPEAKER_00:** Thanks again. It’s awesome. Thanks for coming. Take care.
