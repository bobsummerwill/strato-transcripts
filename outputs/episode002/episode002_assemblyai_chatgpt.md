**[00:01] SPEAKER_00:** All right, welcome back, everybody. The first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter. I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video. And there have been a few people who reached out, who we’ve known a long time, who really appreciated the content. One of them called it, you know, “essential viewing.” So anyway, we’re back for another episode. So, to remind everybody, I’m Kieren James-Lubin, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co-founders. Victor, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

**[00:48] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, okay. I’m Victor Wong, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of BlockApps.

**[00:54] SPEAKER_02:** I’m James Hermosillo, or Jim, CTO and founder, co-founder of BlockApps.

**[01:02] SPEAKER_00:** All right, thank you. And so I believe where we left off—so I can’t watch video of myself, so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode—but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch. And there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit, and then go forward to all of the kind of after-launch activity.

So with that said, maybe I’ll hand it to Victor to talk about the first ConsenSys Dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

**[01:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building what, in those days, were known as dapps. I guess some people still call it that, but that seems to be going out of favor with “blockchain applications.” So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum. And that was in the first ConsenSys office, which was a very small co-working space in Greenpoint.

**[02:12] SPEAKER_00:** I think it was “Greenpoint.” It was called Green Desk, maybe “Green Desks.” Maybe “Green Ducks.”

**[02:21] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that’s right.

**[02:22] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, it’s right next to the modern-day Domino Park, maybe a block away from there or so.

**[02:27] SPEAKER_00:** Exactly. Yeah, that’s right. And of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time. In fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise. I looked up one day and there was a big, well-manicured park there.

**[02:40] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, well, they kind of walled it off, and so it just was like—I don’t know—I thought it was like an abandoned site. And then one day all of a sudden the wall was gone and there was a beautiful… so.

**[02:53] SPEAKER_01:** So at that event, which was I think two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say the concepts were really interesting. People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer. And ConsenSys at this point was only maybe 20 people at max.

**[03:16] SPEAKER_00:** 20 or 30.

**[03:17] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, it was really, really small. And some great concepts came up. But even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time. It was just impossible. Very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain, was kind of impossible. You could read the state off the blockchain—all this kind of stuff.

So that kind of led into… yeah, everything building in those days was incredibly hard. And that led into: we decided at that event we were going to, at the launch of Ethereum, do a bigger hackathon. And that became the second ConsenSys Dappathon, which kind of coincided with the launch of Ethereum. And it was us, the Java client—which I think was called Ethcap at that time—and other tools that were kind of combined together.

But what was really interesting about that one was: it was bigger. I think the first one we had like six participants; the other one we had close to 30. But it introduced a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly. The winner was a GameFi app. It really had that element of tokenized gameplay. There was a decentralized social app, I think, called Truther or something—something like that. And then there was a traceability supply chain app in those early days. And that kind of all coincided with the launch of Ethereum.

**[04:59] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So, okay—and this… so you’re talking about the second one.

**[05:03] SPEAKER_01:** I’m talking about the second one.

**[05:04] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, the second one. Also, the offices had shifted. So ConsenSys, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, which is… I believe they still have a presence there, though they’ve gone mostly remote.

I remember there was a horse lineage app. Pretty interesting. And we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon. But that one was open to externals, right? So that was the big difference. And it actually was quite well attended.

The room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall. And do you think that one was like 24 hours, or it was two days? I can’t remember.

**[05:59] SPEAKER_01:** I think it was two days. And yeah, the air conditioning thing—so we moved into that space to have the hackathon. ConsenSys was moving because they had outgrown that co-working space already. And so we moved into that space, which was a reasonably sized room. You could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room. But yes, the air conditioning was terrible and we had to frantically… we only realized this after we got into the room, so we had to frantically buy some and set them up.

**[06:30] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, I do have a memory of that.

**[06:32] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I don’t know if you recall that, but yeah, we were trying to get those air conditioning units in place before a ton of people showed up. Because we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room.

**[06:44] SPEAKER_00:** These were the scrappy days.

**[06:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[06:46] SPEAKER_00:** Manually configuring air conditioning. I think the amount of furniture assembly that you do is a good proxy for where you are in your startup journey.

**[06:56] SPEAKER_01:** There was a lot of furniture. It was basically an empty room when we moved in there. And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started, to get everything running.

**[07:09] SPEAKER_00:** And was this to commemorate the launch, I think? Or was it right before the launch?

**[07:15] SPEAKER_01:** It was right… actually, if you recall, at the time we didn’t know when the launch would be. The dates were always shifting, right? And we said we wanted to synchronize it with the launch, but because we couldn’t know exactly when the launch was, and even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague—we were like, “Is that going to actually happen?”

So at some point we had to arbitrarily choose the date, and they more or less… what was the right date? I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

**[07:55] SPEAKER_00:** Jim, I might have asked you this last episode, but I’ll ask again. Do you remember: one, trying to predict the launch and could you explain how? And two, there was some complicated mechanism for how the launch would actually happen because it’s hard for a decentralized group to decide on a launch time. I can’t remember that at all.

**[08:13] SPEAKER_02:** You were mentioning it in the last video, and I didn’t remember this, but I don’t doubt it. It sounds correct. You were saying we were looking through the Git commits at the time we were…

**[08:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, you made this plot. It was commits by day and you extrapolated it forward. I think you probably got within a couple days of the launch date. But okay, so I still don’t know how they set the clock on the first block, so to speak. Maybe we can dig this up. There was something they did and that…

**[08:44] SPEAKER_02:** We had it probably in our DMs. I wish I’d thought to look between the first and second video to find the actual discussion that we had. Maybe the graph is in there.

**[08:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, that’s very funny. The Slack is a treasure trove of interesting things.

All right, so it launched, and I kind of felt like there was a “sort of, and then what?” going on. It took a little time for things to get going. And it’s obviously been a smashing success, right? It’s just the reality of a new platform: you get it out there, you see what people do, you learn from it, and it took a minute for the activity to kick in.

**[09:32] SPEAKER_01:** Jim—

**[09:33] SPEAKER_02:** I remember a lot of people around us at the time had been buying a lot of presale ether beforehand. And so the day it came out, I think they were expecting it to have a huge jump in value immediately. And when a couple weeks had gone by and it was only still like 20 cents an ether or so, I remember people around us were kind of like—some of the people there were like, “Oh, this thing was a flop. It’s never going to go anywhere.”

**[09:58] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And psychologically the expectations were super high. There was this concept floating around ConsenSys of “day-one dapps.” Like you had to be ready for the launch because it was a land grab and things were going to the moon. And it turned out to not quite be—again, smashing success—but yeah, the price was under a dollar for a little bit, and then around a dollar for a while, I believe.

And I did want to mention: I had to look this up. So the first ICO, whatever you want to call it, that was on Ethereum—obviously Ethereum did its own crowd sale, but it was like, you know, they took in Bitcoin. And it was something like 2,000 ether to one bitcoin at the time, which I believe at the time was like 20 or 30 cents, and then it had gone up to a dollar on launch, which is already a pretty good return. But that is what it is.

The first ICO apparently was Augur. And I knew the Augur guys a little bit. I was digging through the CryptoEconomicon videos. I believe one or two of them presented or ran panels at CryptoEconomicon. For folks who are listening to this: CryptoEconomicon was a conference that we had in January 2015 that involved a lot of the people who then, including Vitalik and some of the other Ethereum folks, subsequently created really big and interesting, mostly layer-1 projects in the Ethereum space, but others as well.

So the videos are actually up. I tweeted a couple of them, but apparently I think I created a YouTube channel in 2015 and uploaded all those. I definitely remember getting them recorded. So check those out if that’s of interest.

So Augur was the first prediction-markets platform. There since have been a couple new ones that have popped up that seem to be popular. There was also this competing project called Truthcoin. And I was kind of confused about how the two related to each other. I think there was no formal relation, though.

I remember meeting up with this guy named Matt Liston, who I met… I checked his LinkedIn; he’s been at a couple different places. So I think Augur… maybe we should look up who actually founded Augur. So Jeremy Gardner I’ve known over the years, and I met him in San Francisco with Vitalik because Vitalik was staying at what was termed at the time the “Crypto Castle.” And it’s kind of what you would imagine: sort of like a co-working, co-living crypto space. And not everyone there was working on Augur; they were all working on different things. Kind of a common thing to do.

**[12:59] SPEAKER_01:** I think if you hear the term “Crypto Castle” now, people would imagine an actual castle. What you’re describing is more like a dormitory.

**[13:09] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, it was more like a dorm. I mean, it was a nice little house. I can’t remember: it might have been adjacent to the Mission in San Francisco. And so Vitalik would stay there sometimes.

Joey Krug I probably met two or three times over the years. I’m not even sure if I ever met Jack Peterson. So those are the three founders of Augur. So I guess they were good friends with Vitalik, or just realized early on that it would be easier to develop on Ethereum than it would be to try to do something with Bitcoin, which was kind of the predominant suggestion at the time. But they did the first on-Ethereum crowdfund basically right after launch.

Wikipedia is saying August 2015, which is really, really early. I don’t know if I believe this Wikipedia page. It says soon after the platform launched, users had created the “death pools” or assassination markets on famous people. So back in 2015, every discussion about blockchain eventually led both to prediction markets and then this sort of uncensorability—you can’t shut it down—would lead then to assassination markets. Assassination markets being: you bet on the day someone dies, and then someone takes the other side of that bet, kills them, and collects on it.

So apparently there actually were assassination markets created on Augur, according to this Wikipedia page. I’m… yeah, I have to look into that. I’m a little bit dubious. But in any case, I guess Augur then blazed the trail, after Ethereum did with its successful crowd sale, for the wave of ICOs that came later.

But yeah, so Truthcoin was also this competing project. I just remember meeting up with Matt at a Berkeley coffee shop and talking about it. Both Augur and Truthcoin had some sort of machine learning, slightly computer-science, graph-theoretic way of determining what the truth was. So you take a bunch of votes from a bunch of people, but then determine the principal components of how the voting is, then extract the truth from there. So it sounded like very high-end math mechanistic, which is very common in the space.

Crypto has a lot of these mathematician types who came in and wanted to create really complicated schemes and mechanisms and all that sort of stuff that had provable theoretical properties for something interesting about this space. I was in the math department at Berkeley, so that resonated. But yeah—so they must have launched it right away. That’s very interesting.

**[16:06] SPEAKER_01:** I remember us talking to them at some point, and they were developing that. They did want to be a day-one dapp, I remember. And they were, I think, the first—

**[16:15] SPEAKER_00:** The Wikipedia page says they went live in 2018. But they did the crowd sale basically right away.

**[16:19] SPEAKER_01:** Right, right, yeah.

**[16:24] SPEAKER_00:** So should we go on to Devcon 1? Which I guess I can talk about.

So kind of concurrently while all this is happening, we started to work a bunch. ConsenSys had a business development team—a little bit of a mix of marketing, BD, actual sales, etc.—that was starting to generate interest from big companies in the technology.

So for us ourselves, we definitely worked with companies far more than the crypto public for most of the history of the company. Still don’t really work with the crypto public today. But ConsenSys was kind of conflicted on this front. So they had sort of pure blockchain-native projects, and eventually in big numbers. They also had an enterprise arm which was really more consulting-oriented, although they kind of ended up backfilling what they saw demand for with products at times.

But in any case, the BD folks were reaching out to everybody and they got a fair bit of interest from Microsoft. And I think Microsoft had already been watching the Ethereum revolution and seeing it as something interesting, the new front of the cloud war perhaps.

So we got to working with them and actually maybe for the technical part of this I could transition. But basically: ConsenSys had a couple preferred projects which had the low-level—low-level meaning the blockchain client itself—infrastructure that could be deployed on cloud platforms.

And so that ended up being basically us and the Java folks. Vic, do you want to take any—because I think you were saying before—

**[18:33] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, sure. So they were interested in being able to deploy one of the clients that we had. We had the Haskell client and then the Java folks—they were actually more interested in the Java folks. Wait, I should take a step back here.

Just mentioning that Devcon 1 almost didn’t happen, if you recall, because it was in this low period and the Ethereum Foundation was kind of running out of money, which is why the launch had to happen when it happened. And in that low period, they were still trying to preserve a lot of cash, and so it almost didn’t happen. And I remember a lot of people inside ConsenSys were like, “No, we have to bring this, to bring this up and make an event out of this.” I think Andrew Keys was leading the charge in that, really saying, “We’ve got to do this.”

And then this Microsoft thing kind of bundled into that, right? So it was us and the Java client. And my background was: in my previous company I had tried to work with Microsoft in building apps, when they had their first mobile platform. And it took me like six months to get a meeting. And I had a cousin who was like a VP at Microsoft. So it was really hard.

So it was amazing to me that they were just coming to us and they wanted to launch something with us in two months. And I think at that point we decided: okay, this is a huge opportunity. We’re going to drop everything and focus on that launch, which turned out to be the launch of Blockchain as a Service.

But oddly enough, the Java guys started and then they just kind of faded away. They weren’t really interested in pursuing it; they just had other things going on. So we went over it. So by the time Devcon 1 happened, the only thing that was working—our client—was ready on the cloud. You could download it and you could start building on it right away.

And I remember we started to get downloads immediately. People started using it immediately. But that’s also in that run-up: that was when we realized—and Microsoft realized—if we’re going to make this as a developer tool, it can’t connect to the public Ethereum network because people wouldn’t be able to get ether. It was quite hard to get ether at that point. There weren’t really that many exchanges or anything to go on.

So that’s kind of how we created “private Ethereum,” and private enterprise—what became known as private Ethereum or enterprise Ethereum.

So that kind of all led up. And then the launch itself in London when we got up with Microsoft, I think people were shocked that Microsoft was into it. So—

**[21:31] SPEAKER_00:** So I just looked that up and didn’t have it in our little outline, but I had forgotten about this. So I think Coinbase listed ether mid-2016, right? I’m seeing May 24, 2016.

And I guess Kraken was the popular exchange at the time—

**[21:48] SPEAKER_01:** So—

**[21:48] SPEAKER_00:** And I guess it was sketchy for sure. There was like a whale chat box. I never really used it, but I would see it on people’s computers and all that sort of thing. It was difficult to get in and out of ether for a while. Jim, are you going to say something?

**[21:52] SPEAKER_01:** I think it was Poloniex.

**[21:54] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, you’re right. Yeah, Poloniex. It still exists.

**[21:59] SPEAKER_01:** And I just remember there was the chat function on Poloniex. Man, that was crazy. That was Discord before there was Discord.

**[22:08] SPEAKER_00:** Oh wait, hold on. Circle bought it maybe and then it seems to have shut it down. Anyway, I’m confused by all this.

But yeah, so it was difficult to get in and out of ether for a while.

**[22:33] SPEAKER_02:** I’m just kind of remembering back then. Remind me, because I’m not sure if I’ve got this right, but I think maybe you’re downplaying the Java thing a little bit. If I remember right, Microsoft guys were pretty mad at that time. Am I misremembering that?

**[22:49] SPEAKER_01:** No, you’re not. They were. Well, the thing is they really wanted something that they could pitch to companies, and companies use Java, right? So they were really like—

So when we dropped everything and focused on that, I remember we sort of had the internal mantra: we’ve got to get on stage and be able to write a dapp in like 30 seconds. That was our internal mantra.

**[23:23] SPEAKER_02:** They had pre-announced something or something, and then the Java guys sort of disappeared or something.

**[23:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, they pre-announced that they were going to show the Java client and the Haskell client, and we were like the runner-up. I think they kind of accepted us because we were willing to work really hard, and I think they knew they needed a backup.

**[23:50] SPEAKER_02:** The other thing I remember about Microsoft is there was a little bit of tension within there because they were launching Azure at that time. And at the same time they had blockchain people, and the blockchain people really wanted to focus on the blockchain side of it, and the Azure people wanted to use this as a way to promote the new platform. So there was always a little bit of friction within.

**[24:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I remember Marley Gray was really driving those efforts inside Microsoft at the time, and Ko Teeter. They were really, really pushing it. And I remember they were trying to get people in the room to talk to us, and some of them wouldn’t even go in the room. I mean, it was probably like you said: they were launching Azure, so that’s a huge project. I’m sure they were just busy with other stuff, but we spent a lot of time in their New York office. We were going there all the time.

**[24:46] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I’m seeing Azure launches 2010, I checked it. But it did feel much more nascent than it is today. Like Amazon got out there—AWS got out there—and took the whole market, and then Azure was kind of in a catch-up mode. But I think it might have even exceeded AWS revenues at some point.

**[25:04] SPEAKER_02:** They were running around one of the conferences—I can’t remember which one—handing out free passes to everyone.

**[25:11] SPEAKER_01:** It was that conference, Devcon 1.

**[25:13] SPEAKER_02:** Okay.

**[25:14] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, they were handing it out, and that’s why they wanted to make sure we were on their marketplace. So they could hand out this free pass and you could get our client up and running and start building something right away. And that was a revelation to a lot of people. I remember dozens of companies, starting in that first week, their—

**[25:41] SPEAKER_02:** Devious plan worked on us that we grabbed a whole bunch of free passes, and then a year later we were giving them like $10,000 a month to stay on.

**[25:51] SPEAKER_01:** It definitely worked, but I get you.

**[25:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[25:54] SPEAKER_01:** But I don’t know if you remember: the day after the Microsoft announcement, there was a spike in the price and we were like, “I think we just did that.”

**[26:05] SPEAKER_00:** The price? You mean the Microsoft stock price?

**[26:07] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, no. I meant the Ethereum price.

**[26:10] SPEAKER_00:** I think it was both, actually. I have a memory of the Microsoft stock price slightly ticking.

**[26:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think it went up and we were like, “Hey, I think we actually did that.”

**[26:19] SPEAKER_02:** So like ether went from $0.20 to $0.30.

**[26:23] SPEAKER_01:** No, I think it actually went significantly up. I remember it might have doubled for a day or something like that.

**[26:32] SPEAKER_02:** 20 cents to 40 cents, maybe.

**[26:35] SPEAKER_01:** I think it was like a dollar to a dollar eighty or—I don’t remember the price.

**[26:40] SPEAKER_00:** Check it out. It’s hard to see. It’s funny: the price range is so—

Oh, okay. So Devcon’s like December, right? Yeah, something like that. It’s around a dollar. Yeah, there it is ticking up. And I think we definitely got calls related to the Microsoft announcement into January.

**[27:02] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, for sure.

**[27:04] SPEAKER_00:** So we probably had something to do with it. You never know really what’s causing price action.

**[27:10] SPEAKER_02:** But I’m joking, but I just remember the mentality was that until it was up to $20, people thought it was a flop. And somehow when it hit $20, everybody around me all of a sudden got really excited then.

**[27:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, the average person buys high, sells low. So, yeah. That’s pretty successful at 20, and it was still low.

Okay. So moving along: kind of on the back of the enterprise announcement—sorry, the Microsoft announcement—we started to get customers. And a lot of it was enterprises that were fairly early in their journey and wanted just some advice on blockchain technology. Some of them were actually ready to implement something. Vic, you took a whole lot of phone calls.

Do you want to comment on any of that?

**[28:01] SPEAKER_01:** Oh man. Yeah. It was kind of amazing. Now the numbers in relative size seem pretty small, but in the first couple months we went from zero to dozens of companies calling us. And the amazing thing to me was they had actually tried our software. They had played around. And I remember over and over people were like, “Oh, we’ve been working on a blockchain project for the last two years and haven’t been able to build anything, and now we can do something.” So I remember we were getting them from financial companies, resource companies, mining companies. It was all across the spectrum of people trying things because I don’t think they really knew what they wanted to do, but they wanted an easy way to get in. And for the first time they had that.

**[28:59] SPEAKER_00:** Gotcha. Do you remember—so I’m trying to keep this straight. I remember Project Slock.it was sort of being marketed at Devcon 1, but I believe it’s a lot of the same people as The DAO. And do you remember? I think they… but I’m having a hard time keeping it straight.

**[29:26] SPEAKER_01:** So Slock.it was this sort of IoT, kind of strange thing that you could unlock a lock. But it was structured around what actually became The DAO. I think they invented the concept—not the concept, but I think they practically created a DAO in order to fund this lock. And then they realized, “Well, we don’t actually need the lock.” The DAO is the most important thing, and the lock thing is not that interesting.

So yeah, it was 100% the same people. They were introducing both ideas at the same time.

**[30:04] SPEAKER_00:** So let me transition into The DAO part. I’m going to go slightly out of order here. So Victor, what was The DAO?

**[30:15] SPEAKER_01:** So The DAO was basically kind of like an investment fund on the Ethereum blockchain. So basically people would put money into this contract, and this contract would fund different projects. But it started to consume a huge amount of the overall ether supply. I think it was as high as 20 or 25% of the entire ether supply got locked up into this contract.

**[30:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I’m looking on Wikipedia right now. So part of the reason I thought of it in this sequence is: looking at the price action, part of it is that the extant ether supply went down because—

Okay, so as of May 2016, The DAO had attracted nearly 14% of all ether tokens issued to date. So they ran a crowd sale and the crowd sale raised $34 million by May 10, 2016; more than $50 million by May 12; over $100 million by May 15. Sometimes the dynamics of these ICOs… it’s kind of crazy, but one thing that blockchains seem to do that is really difficult to do with other technologies is to have this really large-scale collaboration and, in this case, to pool capital.

So I suppose there was some sort of virality going on. People were talking about The DAO and you just see this enormous movement of funds overnight. And by May 21, 2016, over $150 million in ether from over 10,000 people, which is about—according to the article—about 14% of all ether tokens issued at that time.

**[32:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[32:27] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, so it was really fast. It took everybody by surprise. I remember I had a meeting that the enterprise folks at ConsenSys had set up with, I’m going to say, the people at BBVA—forgetting last names—but I think it was with like Scarlet and Carlos. I don’t think you went to this one, Vic. I think you were in town.

But it caught everyone’s attention. It was crazy. We were talking a bit about operational use cases for the bank, but then there was also a sense that “this is where the future is.” The money just moved. There were no heavy subscription agreements and all that sort of thing. And it was also a cautionary tale of what was to come over the next couple years.

So by June, people discovered that you could exploit The DAO to siphon off the funds. Do you remember anything about that beyond “it was crazy”?

**[33:41] SPEAKER_01:** So there was this massive race between the people who were trying to extract the money out of the contract and the people who actually worked on The DAO itself. There was a flaw in the contract logic, and because it’s immutable, the smart contract couldn’t be changed. And the people who were successful at extracting the money pulled out a lot of it. I don’t remember the number, but it was a huge amount of the value they were able to pull out.

Now the ironic thing was it got pulled out and put into an account and everyone knew where it went because everything on the blockchain is completely transparent. But no one could do anything about it. They couldn’t take the money out. So the money was just sitting there. It was like it got stolen and left on the side of the street, and no one knew what to do about this situation.

**[34:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah.

And so, okay, I’m kind of looking back on it. So it blew up and it also caused the creation… I remember there was, at this time—and we had to implement this in our software—a hard fork debate because it’s pretty early. It’s less than a year after Ethereum launched. Probably a lot of the big ether holders participated in this. They’ve lost significant funds, maybe all of their funds.

And the question was: do you make people whole, or do you stick true to the absolute immutability in the classic blockchain sense where it’s totally buyer beware? Shouldn’t have put your ether in this contract if you weren’t prepared to lose it.

And the refund group won. So in a sense—both Ethereum and Bitcoin, really all projects are governed to an extent by the people who develop the software and on an ongoing basis discuss additions to the protocol, etc. Even in the early days of Bitcoin— I was not really around for this—but supposedly they had to be extremely creative about keeping the protocol running while not ever reverting any of the history. I don’t believe they’ve ever done a hard fork of the nature described here, though there have been forks, obviously, not sponsored by the founders: Bitcoin Cash, all that sort of thing.

And so the Ethereum community elected to—or the Foundation or whatever that is—elected to forcibly revert the funds. There’s a credit as of a certain block number. So everyone got their funds back.

Jim had to code it. Maybe I helped a little bit. I was not coding anymore at this point.

And so then Ethereum Classic was the hard-line: like we’re sticking to immutability. Sorry, Jim—are you going to say something? Oh no—Victor, are you going to say something?

**[37:40] SPEAKER_01:** No, no.

**[37:43] SPEAKER_00:** And so Ethereum Classic got some backers. I think maybe famously Barry Silbert was in Ethereum Classic, maybe still is. And eventually it was, I think, someday—Victor, you told me this—someday later it had a hard fork itself, right? When some issue was discovered with the protocol. Is that correct?

**[38:07] SPEAKER_01:** I don’t know if it was a hard fork or a soft fork, but yeah, there have been debates inside the Ethereum Classic community too on how to implement different changes into the protocol. It’s not just “running.” There’s constantly… I think Bob Summerwill of the Ethereum Classic Collective knows more about this stuff than I do.

**[38:34] SPEAKER_00:** Interesting. Yeah, maybe I could follow up on exactly how this went down. But I think also Ethereum Classic maybe was mining forever, philosophically.

**[38:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[38:45] SPEAKER_00:** Whereas Ethereum switched over to proof of stake like a year ago. So yeah, they were more kind of—

Although there was—okay, yeah. I just googled it. Here’s a June 28 Cointelegraph article that says “Ethereum Classic devs announce upcoming hard fork,” yada yada. So they at least subsequently did some amount of hard forking. But interesting nonetheless.

Funny thing also when this hard fork happens: you don’t—this is a silly comment from someone who’s fairly compliance focused—what’s the tax treatment of a hard fork? You had some tokens on one chain and then they morph and now you have tokens on both chains. I think it’s like airdrops too: they’re like ordinary income, which means whether or not you wanted those hard fork coins, you probably have to pay taxes on them if you can access and liquidate them. But you have to pay whether or not you liquidate. It’s not just capital gains.

So interesting. Quite a strange test of our system that we’ve seen with blockchain because they fork all the time. There’s lots of airdrops, etc. And you might not even be aware.

All right, so that was The DAO. This was crazy. I still kind of can’t believe this happened. And it’s happened way bigger and differently later. But it was quite a moment, all of this.

**[40:28] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I looked up the current price, and in current dollars it would be roughly the equivalent of $30 billion if you think about it. So yeah, it’d be huge, because Ethereum was so small at the time.

**[40:44] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah.

Okay, I want to take you to the second CoinDesk Consensus Hackathon, and again hand it to Victor for everything you recall. Also we have some pictures from that time. Do you want to show some of that on screen?

**[41:02] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I found it from CoinDesk. Let me see if I can still find them.

So what I remember is it was one of the first CoinDesk Consensus events, which subsequently became huge. And they had two events around it. One was a hackathon, which we were part of, and we were one of the main platforms participating in it. And then there was the event itself, which was I think at the Ritz. Both events were in Times Square.

The hackathon came first at Microsoft in Times Square, and then the event was a couple blocks away in the hotel.

And I remember that during the hackathon itself we were all in these different conference rooms. There was early Hyperledger and some other—I can’t remember who the other clients were—but there were competing clients that were not Ethereum-based. And there was a pretty good turnout. I think over a hundred people showed up.

A lot of people showed up, and our room got so crowded we had to co-opt another boardroom in order to build. So I think we got a significant majority of the developers building stuff on our platform, which was super exciting.

And I remember kind of walking by the rooms that Hyperledger had, and I’m trying to remember what the other client had. There weren’t very many people in there. It seemed like the people that were in there were people who were working for them. So that was really exciting.

Though at the end, we didn’t win—or at least someone building on our stack didn’t win—because I think the winner was actually something that was getting built way before that hackathon existed, which was technically against the rules. But we didn’t hold any… this is—

**[43:18] SPEAKER_00:** Victor asserts: if we lost, it’s because someone else cheated. So that’s how we feel.

**[43:22] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly. That’s at least how I felt at the time. Whether or not that’s completely true, that memory is subjective. That’s all I say, right?

**[43:39] SPEAKER_00:** And the rest of the conference?

**[43:44] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, and then the rest of the conference: that, I think, was the first shiny big blockchain conference. Most of the other conferences like Devcon are really developer-focused, but this one you could really see a lot of businesses becoming interested.

And the thing I most remember about that conference is we were pulled into a room at one point. In that room was the head of Hyperledger—John Wolpert—and Vitalik were in that room. And they were like, “Hey, we heard you guys have an enterprise-ready version of Ethereum that can switch between the public net and private blockchains, right?” And I remember Wolpert at the time was like, “My engineers claim this is completely impossible.” And Jim, I think you pulled up your laptop and you’re like, “Here it is. I’m going to show you. This is how it works. You can start building on it and everything.”

And there was this conversation going back and forth between Wolpert and Vitalik about Hyperledger supporting Ethereum. And what I remember was it ended with… I think Vitalik always wears an Ethereum T-shirt, right? And Wolpert is about three sizes larger than Vitalik.

**[45:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I would say: I think Vitalik is very tall. But sure, if they had a bench press competition, I expect there would be a pretty big differentiation in what John could bench versus what Vitalik could bench.

**[45:49] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think you’re right. We’re not talking that John is unfit; he’s just much larger. And Vitalik is still quite skinny, right? So John was three sizes bigger.

And I think it was Andrew Keys that pointed to the T-shirt and was like, “Vitalik, take that shirt off and give it to John,” because he was about to walk on stage. And it was like a muscle shirt on him. It was so tight. It was like a compression shirt.

And he went on stage and people were kind of shocked: “Hey, what’s going on? This is Hyperledger and now he’s wearing an Ethereum T-shirt.” And it’s interesting because what eventually that led to was Hyperledger actually supporting Ethereum-type clients like Burrow.

**[46:38] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I would add: talking to John occasionally over the years—he actually went on to join ConsenSys later. I don’t really know what he’s up to today. I don’t think he’s there anymore. But he had a sense of not wanting to be on the wrong side of history.

He was always talking about IBM’s embrace of Linux, as opposed to pushing really hard on a continual basis with its own operating system. So they put a ton of open source software development into Linux, and of course it probably helped them have something to run on their mainframes, which is still actually a big business for them today.

And so he was always debating back and forth: should we do our own thing? It was at least mostly open source. Should we go the Ethereum way? What do we do? And I think this was perhaps the best illustration of that conflict.

I think IBM has since… it was formidable for a while and sort of scary as a competitor and all that sort of thing. And I don’t hear that much blockchain noise out of them anymore. I think they’ve shifted resources and all that sort of thing.

**[47:57] SPEAKER_01:** By the way, I did find the picture from that first hackathon. So this is off of CoinDesk, but here’s the picture at the mic. And this was one of the rooms. And we had to co-op another room—this was very early in the process.

And here I am sitting in the middle of it over here. But yes, it grew really, really rapidly.

**[48:30] SPEAKER_00:** All righty. Close to rounding up here, but got a couple more things.

So things are moving along. 2016, there’s some kind of organic momentum. I know we hired a lot of people during this period of time. We’re delivering—our software has been used in enterprise projects. We’re ramping up headcount because people are using our software more.

And so I’m looking at this and I can’t believe that the timeframe were this tight. So Devcon 2 is September 2016, and so it’s in Shanghai, right?

So I do remember having to deal with all the visa stuff. Thankfully ConsenSys dealt with that. We were kind of doing a capital raise—sort of our first seed-ish one—at that time. But it felt like a coming-out party.

What do you guys recall? What are some of your impressions from Devcon 2?

**[49:46] SPEAKER_02:** There was some big attack on Ethereum. I’m trying to remember the details right now, but I remember waking up in the morning and suddenly I was completely involved in digging in with the Haskell client and figuring out what was going on and what changes we had to make.

**[50:07] SPEAKER_01:** I do remember it was like—

**[50:10] SPEAKER_00:** Transactions that slowed the clients down being created, right? And yeah, I think it was due to the way the data structures worked to some extent. It was hard to make them process fast. I can’t recall. But yeah, it was funny that it was right around that time also. Okay, so good.

**[50:35] SPEAKER_02:** Well, the funny thing that I sort of remember is—and maybe you’re about to talk about this—but the EEA was sort of formed during that conference. And Victor somehow in the morning grabbed me and he’s like, “I’ve got all these meetings and I’d like you to come along too.” But I had my laptop and I was trying to dig into the tech with all this stuff that was going on there.

So I sort of sat in the corner in this coffee shop and I was programming all day. And then at the end of the day I was like, “What were all those meetings you had?” And Victor essentially was like, “Oh yeah, we just formed the EEA.”

**[51:09] SPEAKER_01:** Well, yeah, it was funny. I think really it was Jeremy Miller, who later went on to become Chief of Staff for ConsenSys, who really drove that.

There had been a previous attempt, I think by Matt Spoke, to create some sort of group of enterprises to work together on standards, and that never kind of went anywhere.

**[51:32] SPEAKER_00:** But then I have no memory of this, so could you—Matt was at Deloitte at the time.

**[51:46] SPEAKER_01:** And Deloitte was early into blockchain. They were at Devcon 1. They were really early into blockchain and kind of building up a practice, ironically in the Toronto office. So they were really focused on it. And so they were quite early and quite knowledgeable.

And so they were trying to, at some point, start effectively a consortium of companies who wanted to use Ethereum, right? And then there was us where we were working with Microsoft—that was happening sort of organically. But we realized there was the need for companies to collaborate, to work together on this kind of stuff.

And Jeremy Miller just thought: what’s happening now isn’t working. We’ve got to get some proper structure. Because I think it was just an announcement on the Ethereum Foundation site, but no one was really driving it.

So during that day, we aggregated a bunch of people in that coffee shop. It was literally happening beside you. And there was Jeremy, John Whelan was there from Santander, Matt Spoke came in, I think Marley came in at one point, and James Lazarus came in. And we were all saying, “Okay, we need this organization. We need to get this together.” And it was all happening at this coffee shop that was the Starbucks just literally outside the conference center. And it all came together.

And it was amazing to me because by the end of the day we were like, “Yes, we’re going to form this group,” that eventually became the EEA.

**[53:30] SPEAKER_00:** So I want to add some peripheral details.

So we get to Shanghai, right? We’re jet lagged. It’s a hefty flight. You get this card and the card says something like, “Aliens not going to hotels.” Aliens being people who are not Chinese who are in the country must report to the police within 72 hours or something. I was like, does that mean the hotels are part of the police? I don’t know. I assume plenty of listeners will not have been to mainland China.

And then you get to the hotel. It’s like an hour drive, whenever the main airport is, to the hotel. Shanghai is vast. There are high-rises along the highway the whole way, and they just get denser as you get close to where we were.

Is there a name for the neighborhood? We were staying in the old stock exchange, I believe, which had been converted to a hotel.

**[54:39] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, we were right downtown. I’m trying to remember where we stayed at the time. The conference was right downtown, close to the Bund. That’s the area next to the river.

**[54:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, that’s right. So the Bund on one side, and then the other side is brand new.

**[54:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that’s Pudong. That originally was the suburbs basically.

And I’ve founded two companies in China, so I think I was the “China expert” there, taking people around.

If you’re not staying in a hotel, the government wants to know how to reach you. So if you’re staying in an Airbnb and stuff, you need to—if you stay in a hotel, the hotel takes care of all of that stuff for you. They handle it.

But I remember taking you guys for a Chinese breakfast, and you guys loved it. We went back to that same place. I was like, “They’re all really good.”

**[55:42] SPEAKER_00:** I think we went to a couple holes-in-the-wall too.

**[55:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly. So it was this hole-in-the-wall place, and I was trying to give you the flavor, and you guys really liked it, so we kept that.

The other thing I remember about that conference is that the Wall Street Journal was there, and I remember I got quoted as saying, “I think China is going to be one of the biggest blockchain markets in the world.” This is before they started their own digital currency and really went in on creating their own blockchain. But I remember people thought it was absolutely bonkers when I said that because they hadn’t done anything yet. It was so early in the journey. But as you said, this all happened really fast.

**[56:29] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I’d also mention: so we announced a project we were working on and it was getting close to completion with BHP Billiton—just a big-time project and kind of the first of our supply chain work.

Our champion at BHP was a guy named Tyler Smith. Very smart guy, geophysicist, blockchain enthusiast. And so the announcement was great. It definitely got everyone excited about the technology. It helped us close the financing at that time, etc. So we were all on stage.

But I also want to mention: Tyler, I think he’d been to Shanghai before and, as one does when one’s in Asia, you try to get some suits for lower cost. And he kind of told me his algorithm. There’s something nearby called, I believe, the Fabric Market. Is that very big?

**[57:26] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that’s right.

**[57:26] SPEAKER_00:** And he sort of hung out there for a little bit. He told me. He watched where the Chinese businesspeople went, and they all went up to the third floor to this particular guy. So he showed us where that was. I think you got some too, right?

**[57:43] SPEAKER_01:** I did. And that algorithm worked out really well. That is also my algorithm for finding good places to eat. Like, the way I found that hole-in-the-wall place: I follow where taxi drivers wind up stopping. And if that’s the place, they probably have pretty good food there.

**[58:08] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And he told me also the last time he had done a China trip, he went like 10 hours by buses, trains, boats to get the best silk blankets, somewhere near Shanghai. I was never able to look into this and get them back.

So similarly he followed the local knowledge and it got you a long way, I guess.

**[58:32] SPEAKER_01:** Well, nowadays it’s all high-speed rail. I remember at various times traveling through China and having 18-hour train rides and stuff like that, which were brutal because many times I just had to stand during that entire time in a crowded thing. But yeah, now it’s high-speed rail. It’s amazing. It’s faster than planes in most cases.

**[58:56] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. In any case, it was an experience.

So we also did some business development there, had a lot of meetings with prospective customers, investors, all that sort of thing. It’s definitely tough to do business in China for listeners considering it and not from China. I don’t recommend it unless you really know what you’re doing.

But it was quite the trip. I actually had to leave a little bit early for some events I was doing with Intel, actually.

**[59:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that’s right.

**[59:32] SPEAKER_00:** But it was crazy. It made—Ethereum was actually kind of Europe-centric, but I think Asia almost bigger uptake there. So it made it feel really global.

And it was just kind of funny to see all of this happening at the same time. The internet kind of worked. It was cool to hang out in Shanghai as well, and it just felt like a totally different planet.

All right, I think with that segue we could probably wrap it up with the EEA leading up to the EEA launch.

So the idea had been hatched in a Starbucks in Shanghai. And basically the quote—Jeremy was fond of saying—is that every innovation lab is using Ethereum now. They’re watching us and they’re each hacking it their own way to be something they can actually use. So no one wanted to connect to the public net at that time. It’s definitely changed some over the years, especially with the NFT revolution, etc.

And so there was not a lot of technological reuse going on in the duct tape that various enterprises were putting on the software to make it work for their needs. Probably most notable in that set of enterprises was J.P. Morgan, which we can talk about in more detail. But a lot of them were doing it. The folks at the Innovation Lab at Santander, who we know pretty well, were doing their own thing. It was quite interesting to observe.

And Vic, do you remember: there were a couple face-to-face meetings that were very hush-hush. I think Microsoft hosted some of them around the launch of the EEA. So you’ve napkinned out the idea in Starbucks, but then what was the next thing that happened?

**[1:01:55] SPEAKER_01:** So then there were a series of meetings that were really about structuring. How did we want to structure this organization? What composition should it be? Should it be all big companies? How much of the tech should be involved? How much of the company side should be involved and how it should work? Should it be a free organization? Should we charge membership? All of that was on the table.

But the amazing thing about those meetings is they did start small, but they eventually wound up to be like 40 people in the room. All the major clients. Because I think at the time, really where the interest was in terms of real-world applications of the Ethereum blockchain was in the enterprise space. They were willing to make investments into that. So everyone was participating in it. So there were these really, really active discussions.

And ultimately we just had to set a line in the sand and make a launch, basically. And that led to it launching in early 2017.

But in terms of timeframe, you’ve got to think: it was only a little over a year when we launched with a single big company. And then at the launch of EEA, it was like 40 companies that were—

**[1:03:26] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I remember 28 or something like that. There was a logo wall that was nice. It was really substantial.

**[1:03:34] SPEAKER_01:** And it was in the Brooklyn J.P. Morgan office. And it was a lot of big players. And this really told the world: “Hey, this is serious. This is something that should happen.” So it was really, really exciting.

But yeah, the negotiations around it were really complicated. And in some cases I remember one of the biggest negotiations was between the different clients, right? There was us and there were other clients who were trying to figure out: how do we share information between us?

**[1:04:07] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

I’d also add: okay, so J.P. Morgan—when did they announce Quorum?

**[1:04:14] SPEAKER_01:** That’s a good question. I don’t… I think it was probably before the EEA launch, but I’m not sure. I know they had a blockchain team that, ironically, also were working in Haskell. And eventually we wound up doing work on Quorum too, so we had been talking to them a while. But I can’t remember when the official launch of Quorum was.

**[1:04:41] SPEAKER_00:** I have some memory that they demoed something at—and ConsenSys might have helped the front end of the demo. I can’t quite recall, but I believe they demoed something at the launch, which was what? Like 2/2/2017, something like that.

**[1:05:02] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[1:05:03] SPEAKER_00:** So I think they must have announced it by then.

So Quorum was a flavor of Ethereum or a flavor of enterprise Ethereum, where they’d taken the Go Ethereum client and done things like add privacy so that it was easier to obscure data. And there was a messaging layer. It had, etc. And similar things we developed over the years, as we—in response to the privacy preferences and needs of big enterprises. They all wanted to use the technology, didn’t want a native token, they didn’t want too much detail leaking to potentially competitors or even trading counterparties, etc.

So a lot of people at the same time developed similar features to serve the enterprise need.

But yeah, so the event: 30 big enterprises there—or 30 companies, a few startups, a lot of big enterprises.

I think the membership of the EEA peaked at like 500 companies or something really large, right?

**[1:06:20] SPEAKER_01:** It was in the hundreds.

**[1:06:22] SPEAKER_00:** I don’t remember—100 or something like that. So on the back of this announcement, the business side got pretty excited. And later in that year there’s also crypto run-ups. Everyone wanted to be involved.

But I think of the EEA launch as sort of “the end of the beginning.” If you look back at the price trend—so let’s say it’s February here—it does start to really tick up and hit into kind of a fever pitch 2017, 2018, right? So it’s already at this time around 10 bucks. But it really goes dramatically up.

And then the next phase is the heyday of the ICO era, which we probably won’t talk about today. But in my mind that was when it was a new but established platform and technology. Ethereum kind of generally acknowledged by some of the public, but big businesses as well, and had transitioned. It was almost in the position of incumbent at that point.

Now I also don’t quite recall: when did Ethereum move up the ranks? It’d be good to know what were the big ranked crypto coins at that time. For a while Litecoin was number two, right?

**[1:08:07] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, and I think Ripple was up there.

**[1:08:10] SPEAKER_00:** XRP was usually three or something. And I don’t even know where Litecoin is today. I’d have to check when the actual crossover happened. Ethereum would be solidly number two for a long time. But maybe we should figure that out. Right now I forget how to overlay prices on CoinMarketCap or the market caps rather.

So we’ve never seen the flippening just yet, but it got close at different times in this journey.

So anyway, I think we could probably leave it there. Slightly shorter than the last episode it appears, but I don’t know.

Any final words? Jim, from this interesting time period in many people’s lives—our lives.

**[1:09:06] SPEAKER_01:** I think looking back, it seems that if you look back on successful projects, there’s survivorship bias: all the elements were just there and you can see a lot of the elements there. But I don’t think in any way that success was predetermined. There was a lot—

**[1:09:33] SPEAKER_00:** A lot of coordinated effort, right. A lot of working hard on it together, getting the pieces to make it happen, so to speak.

**[1:09:41] SPEAKER_02:** It’s dangerous to look back in time and say, “I knew that was going to happen.” But I will say that even before the launch, I remember feeling that I’d never seen such a large group of people so excited about a particular project as that one. So yeah, it felt like it was going to be successful.

**[1:10:04] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I just mean: we’ve mentioned a bunch of the people that—I think they all contributed to the success of the key point, even though they weren’t the founders of Ethereum. They made something happen that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

**[1:10:21] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it’s an interesting thing. It’s like: are you being tossed in a great wave, or can you will reality into existence? And I tend to think of it as a little bit of both, right?

**[1:10:33] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, it’s not all hot air from us, because we literally did some of it—successful technology.

**[1:10:41] SPEAKER_01:** So—

**[1:10:42] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Anyways, all right, let’s close it there. Thanks everybody for listening this far, if you make it this far on the second one. And yeah, it’d be interesting—we might continue this series. We could also kind of delve in on any particular part of it. Maybe we’ll get a guest, maybe we’ll do something. So if anyone wants us to cover anything particular, please do let us know.

**[1:11:11] SPEAKER_01:** Thanks everyone. Have a great day.

**[1:11:13] SPEAKER_02:** Thank you.
