> All right, well, welcome back, everybody. The first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter. I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video. And there have been a few people who reached out, who we've known a long time who really appreciated the content. One of them called it, you know, essential viewing. So anyway, we're back for another episode, so remind everybody. I'm KIERAN James Lubin, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co founders, Victor. Do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

> Gotcha. Do you remember? So I believe I'm trying to keep this straight. So I remember the, the Project Slocket was sort of being marketed at devcon one, but I believe it's a lot of the same people as the Dao. And do you remember? Like, I think they. But I can't. I'm having a hard time keeping it straight.

Victor, do you want to introduce yourself quickly? Oh, okay. I'm Victor Wong, co-founder and chief product officer of BlockApps. I'm James Hermosdia, or Jim, CTO and co-founder of BlockApps. All right. Thank you. And so, I believe where we left, so I can't watch... video of myself so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode but I believe we pretty much ended with the ethereum launch and there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kind of after launch activity so with that said um maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first consensus dapathon which was uh June 2015 I believe

**Intermediate:**

> The other thing I, I remember about Microsoft is that there was a little bit of like, uh, um, uh, tension within there because there were the, they were just launching Azure at that time. Yeah. And at the same time they had blockchain people and the blockchain people really wanted to focus on the blockchain side of it. And the Azure people wanted to like use this as a way to, to promote, uh, the new platform. So, so there was always a little bit of friction within.

#### [33:35] SPEAKER_00 (block 31/60)

**Intermediate:**

> yeah do you remember anything about that but beyond you know it was crazy um so so there were so you had all the supply locked into this contract and I think the hack was like yeah so there was this massive race between there was a flaw in the contract logic and because it's immutable the smart contract couldn't be changed right and when people realized there was this massive race between the people who were trying to extract the money out of the contract and the people who actually worked on the Dow itself so it was like this and but the people who were successful at kind of extracting the money pulled out a lot of it like I think I I don't remember the number but I think it was like a huge amount of the value they were able to pull that out yeah now the the the ironic thing was that it got pulled out and put into an account and everyone knew where it went because you know everything on the blockchain is completely transparent but no one could do anything about it like they couldn't take the money out and so the money was just sitting there basically that got like it was like it got stolen and left on the side of the street or something and no one knew what to do about this situation

**Intermediate:**

> um well I I yeah it was funny I I think really it was Jeremy Miller who I think later went on to become chief of staff for consensus who really kind of drove that like there had been a previous attempt um I think by Matt spoke to create some sort of group of enterprises to work together on standards and that never kind of went anywhere but then I have no memory of this so uh could you um um you know Matt was at Deloitte Matt was at Deloitte at the time and Deloitte was early into blockchain like so they were at defcon1 they were really early into blockchain and kind of building up a practice um ironically in the Toronto office right so like they're really focused on it and so they were quite early and quite knowledgeable and so they were trying to kind of at some point they had started this effectively a consortium of companies who want to use Ethereum, right? And then there was us where we were working with Microsoft that was happening sort of organically. But we realized that there was the need for companies to kind of collaborate, to work together on this kind of stuff. And Jeremy Miller just thought like this is in working like what's happening now isn't working we gotta get some you know proper structure uh because I think it was just an announcement on the ethereum Foundation site but no one was really driving it so during that day we like kind of aggregated a bunch of people in that coffee shop like it was like literally happening beside you and there was like Jeremy, you know, John Wheeling was there from Santander, like, Matt Spohr came in, I think Marley came in at one point, and, you know, Lali, James Laszlo came in, and we were all kind of saying, okay, we need this organization, we need to get this together. And it was all happening at this coffee shop that was at the Starbucks that was just like, just literally outside the conference center. And

**Intermediate:**

> I'm just kind of remembering back then. Remind me, because I'm sort of like, not sure if I've got this straight, but I think maybe you're downplaying the Java thing a little bit. I think if I remember right, Microsoft guys were pretty mad at that time. Am I misremembering that?

**opus:**

> It definitely works. But I don't know if you remember like that the day after the Microsoft announcement, there was a spike in the price and we were like...

#### [29:26] SPEAKER_00 (block 39/76)

**Intermediate:**

> So Slockit was this sort of IoT kind of strange thing that you could unlock a lock, but they, it was structured around what actually became the DAO like they I think they invented the concept not the concept but I think they practically created a DAO in order to their own this lock and then they realized well you know I I think they realized well we don't actually need to lock like the DAO is the most important thing and the lock the actual lock thing is not that interesting so yeah it was 100 the same people like they were introducing both ideas at the same time

**Intermediate:**

> I do remember it was like transactions that slowed the clients down being created. Right. Um, and yeah, I think like, um, I guess it was like due to the way the data structures work, to some extent, it was like hard to make them process fast I can't recall, but yeah it was funny that was right around that time. Also okay.
