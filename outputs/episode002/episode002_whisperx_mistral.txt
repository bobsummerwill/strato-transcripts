SPEAKER_03: All right, well welcome back everybody. The first episode of The Early Days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter. I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video. There have been a few people who reached out who we've known a long time who really appreciated the content. One of them called it, you know, essential viewing. So anyway, we're back for another episode.

So remind everybody, I'm Kieren James-Lubin, CEO of BlockApps. Here with my co-founders Victor Wong, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of BlockApps, and James Hormuzdiar, CTO and founder, co-founder of BlockApps. All right, thank you. So I believe where we left off, I can't watch video of myself so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch. There were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kind of after launch activity. So with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first ConsenSys Dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building, you know, what in those days were known as Dapps. I guess some people still call it that, but that seems to have gone now in favor of blockchain applications. So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum. That was in the first ConsenSys office, which was like a very small co-working space in Greenpoint, I think. I would say it was called Green Desk, maybe.

SPEAKER_01: Green Desk, yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's right next to the modern-day Domino Park, maybe a block away from there or so.

Exactly, yeah, that's right. So, and it, of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time. In fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise. I looked up one day and there was like a big, well-manicured park there. Yeah, well, they kind of walled it off and so it just was like, I, I don't know, I thought it was like an abandoned site and then one day all of a sudden the wall was gone and there was a beautiful park there.

SPEAKER_00: So at that event, which was, I think, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say the concepts were really interesting. People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer. ConsenSys at this point was only like maybe 20 people at max, 20 or 30, yeah. That's interesting. It was really, really small, and you know, some great concepts came up, but like even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that nobody could build anything in a short period of time. It was just impossible. Very basic stuff like reading a variable off the blockchain was kind of impossible. You couldn't read the state off the blockchain and all this kind of stuff. So, um, that kind of led into, yeah, like everything building in those days were incredibly hard, and that led into so we decided at that event we were gonna, at the launch of Ethereum, we were going to do a bigger hackathon. Um, that became the second ConsenSys Dappathon, which coincided with the launch of Ethereum. It was us, you know, the Java client, which I think was called Ether Camp at that time, um, and like other tools that were kind of combined together. But what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger. Like I think the first one we had like six participants, the other one we had like, I think, close to 30. Um, but it introduced like a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly. Like what the winner was a game, Fire App, like it really had that element of tokenized gameplay. There was a decentralized social app, I think called Truther or something, something like that, and then um, there was like a traceability supply chain app in those early days. And that kind of all coincided, uh, with like the launch of Ethereum.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so okay, so you're talking about the second one. I'm talking about the second one, yeah. The second one also, the offices had shifted, so we had um, um, our ConsenSys, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, um, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, um, which I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone um, mostly remote. I remember there was like a, there's like a horse lineage app. Yeah, yeah, interesting. You know, um, and we ended up actually hiring a couple of people who participated in the hackathon, but that one was, uh, open to externals, right? So that was the big difference, and it actually was, you know, quite well attended. Um, the room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there if I recall. Um, and you think that one was like 24 hours or it was two days? I can't, I think it was two days, and yeah, like the air conditioning thing.

SPEAKER_00: So we moved into that space to have the hackathon. Like you know, ConsenSys was growing because they had outgrown that co-working space already. And so we moved into that space, which can, you know, was a reasonably sized room. Like you could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room, right? But yes, the air conditioning was terrible, and we had to frantically, um, we only realized this after we got into the room. So we had to like frantically buy some and set them up.

SPEAKER_03: Okay, I do have a memory of that.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't know if you recall that. But yeah, we were like trying to like get those air conditioning units in place before a ton of people showed up. Because yeah, like we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room.

SPEAKER_03: These were the scrappy days in manually configuring air conditioning. I think the amount of furniture assembly that you do is a good proxy for how scrappy you are in your startup journey.

SPEAKER_00: There was a lot of furniture. It was basically an empty room when we moved in there. And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started. So we had to get everything up and running. And it was, this was to, like, sort of commemorate the launch. I think, or was it like right before the launch? It was, it was, it was right. It actually, you know, if if you recall at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be. Like this, the dates were always shifting, right? And we just said we kind of arbitrarily chose like we wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch, but because it was because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was, and even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague. Like we're like exactly what actually happened. So we, we had at some point had to arbitrarily choose the date, and they, they more or less, what was the right date? Like I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

SPEAKER_03: Jim, I might have asked you this last episode, but I'll ask again. Do you remember one trying to predict the launch and could you explain how? And two, there was some complicated mechanism for how the launch would actually happen because it's hard for like a decentralized group to decide on a launch time. I can't remember that at all.

SPEAKER_01: You were mentioning it in the last video, and I didn't remember this, but I don't doubt it. It sounds correct. You were saying we were looking through the Git commits at the time.

SPEAKER_03: We were, yes. You made this plot. It was like commits by day, and as the commits, and you extrapolated it for it. I think it probably got within a couple of days of the launch date. Okay, so I have to, yeah, I still don't know how they like set the clock on the first block so to speak. Maybe we can like dig this up. There was something they did, um, and that we had probably in our DMs. I, I wish I thought to look between the first and second video to find the actual discussion that we had. Maybe the graph is in there. Yeah, yeah, that's very funny. The Slack is the treasure trove of, uh, interesting things. Um, all right, uh, so yeah, so it launched, um, and I kind of felt like there was a sort of, and then what going on. You know it took a little time for things to get going, and then you know this, it obviously it's been a smashing success, right? It's just sort of the, the reality of a new platform. You sort of get it out there, you see what people do, you learn from it. And it took a minute for the activity to kick in.

SPEAKER_01: I remember a lot of people around us at the time had been buying a lot of presale Ether beforehand. And so the day it came out, I think they were expecting it to have a huge jump in value immediately. And when, when like you know a couple weeks had gone by and it was only, uh, still like 20 cents in Ether. So I remember people around us were kind of like, some of the people there were like, oh this thing was a flop, it's never gonna go anywhere.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's just psychologically, yeah, the expectations were super high. There was this concept floating on ConsenSys of day one Dapps, like yeah, I had to be ready, right, for the launch because you know it was a land grab and things were going to the moon and you know it turned out to, you know, not quite obviously again smashing success but yeah the price was like under a dollar for a little bit and then around a dollar for like a while I believe. Um, and I did want to mention so, um, I, I had to look this up so the first ICO, whatever you want to call it, that was on Ethereum obviously Ethereum did its own crowd sale, um, but it was like, you know, they took in Bitcoin and there was, it was something like two thousand Ether to one Bitcoin at the time, which I believe at the time was like 20 or 30 cents. And then it had gone up to a dollar on launch, which is already a pretty good return, you know, but that is what it is. The first ICO apparently was Augur. And I knew the Augur guys a little bit. I was digging through the CryptoEconomicon videos. I believe one or two of them presented or run panels at CryptoEconomicon. For folks who are listening to this, CryptoEconomicon was a conference that we had in January 2015 that involved a lot of the people who then, including Vitalik Buterin and some of the other Ethereum folks, um, then subsequently created really big and interesting mostly layer one projects in the Ethereum space but others as well. So the videos are actually up. I tweeted a couple of them, but there was a, apparently I think I created a YouTube channel like in 2015 and uploaded all those. I definitely remember getting them recorded. So check those out if that's of interest. So Augur was the first, I guess, of the prediction markets platforms. There have since been a couple of new ones that have popped up that seem to be popular. There was also this sort of competing project called Truthcoin. Um, and I was kind of confused about how the two related to each other. Um, I think there was no formal relation though I remember meeting up, there's getting Matt Liston. I met who, I checked his LinkedIn, he's been a different couple different places. So I think Augur, uh, maybe we should look up who actually founded Augur. So Jeremy Gardner, I, you know, I've known over the years. And he, I met him in San Francisco with Vitalik. Because Vitalik was staying at what was, uh, turned at the time the Crypto Castle. Um, and you know it's kind of what you would imagine sort of like a co-working co-living, um, crypto space for, and not everyone there was working on Augur, they're all working on different things. It's kind of common, uh, thing to do. Well, I, I think if you hear the term Crypto Castle now people would imagine an actual castle. Say you know what you're describing which is more like a dormitory. Yeah, it was more like a dorm. I mean it was a nice, nice little house. I think I can't remember it might have been like adjacent to the Mission in, in San Francisco. Um, and so Vitalik would stay there sometimes. Joey Krug, I've probably met two or three times over the years. I'm not even sure if I ever met Jack Peterson. So those are the three founders of Augur. So I guess they were good friends with Vitalik or just sort of had realized early on that it would be easier to develop on Ethereum than it would be to try to do something with Bitcoin, which was kind of the predominant suggestion at the time. But they did the first on Ethereum, um, crowdfund, um, like I guess right after launch. The Wikipedia is saying August 2015, um, which is really, really early. I don't know if I believe this Wikipedia page. It says soon after the platform launched users had created the death pools or assassination markets on famous people. So back in 2015, every discussion about blockchain, Justin Delacruz, Ph.D.: eventually led both to prediction markets and then this sort of uncensored ability. You can't shut it down would lead then to assassination markets. Um, assassination markets being you predict, you bet on the day someone dies. You know, and then someone takes the other side of that bet, Justin Delacruz- kills them and collects on it. So apparently they're actually were assassination markets created on Augur according to this Wikipedia page. I'm, yeah, I have to look into that. I'm a little bit dubious but in any case. Justin Delacruz- I guess Augur then blazed the trail sort of after Ethereum did with a successful crowd sale. Um, for the wave of ICOs that, that came later. Um, but yeah, so Truthcoin was also this competing project. I just remember meeting up with Matt at like a Berkeley coffee shop and talking about both Augur and Truthcoin had some sort of, David Price- you know, machine learning slightly like computer science graph theoretic way of like determining what the truth was. So like you take a bunch of votes from a bunch of people, but then determine the principal components of, David Price- how the voting is and extract the truth from there. It was, it was sounded like very, you know, high-end math mechanistic, which it was very common of the space. Every like, you know, the crypto has a lot of these like, and I was in the math department, a lot of these like mathematician types who like kind of came in and wanted to create like really complicated schemes and mechanisms and all that sort of stuff that had provable theoretical properties for something interesting about, you know, this, this space. But yeah, I'm so, so they must have launched it like right away. That's very interesting. I remember us talking to them at some point and they were developing that like they did want to be a day one Dapp. I remember and they were, I think the platform went live 2018. The Wikipedia page says, but they did the crowd sale like basically right away, right, right, yeah. Um, so should we go on to DevCon 1, which I guess I can talk about? So kind of concurrently while all this is happening, we started to work a bunch. So ConsenSys had a business development team, a little bit, a mix, um, marketing BD actual sales, etc., that um, was starting to generate interest from big companies in the technology. So, um, you know, uh, for us ourselves, we definitely worked with companies far more than sort of the crypto public for, you know, most of the history of the company. Um, still don't really work with the crypto public today. Um, but you know, ConsenSys was kind of conflicted on this front. So they, you know, what they, they had sort of pure blockchain native project and eventually in big numbers. They also had an enterprise arm which is really more consulting oriented although they kind of ended up sort of backfilling what they saw demand for with products at times. But in any case, the BD folks were reaching out to everybody and they actually got a fair bit of interest from Microsoft. And I think Microsoft had already been kind of watching the Ethereum revolution and seeing it as something interesting, the new front of the cloud war perhaps. And so you know we got to working with them and so maybe for the technical part of this I could kind of transition. But basically so ConsenSys had a couple, you know, preferred projects which had the low-level, I mean like the blockchain client itself infrastructure that could be deployed on cloud platforms and maybe yeah so that ended up being basically us and the, you know, the Java folks. Um, Vic, do you want to take any, I think you were saying before.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, sure. So they were interested in kind of being able to deploy one of the clients that we had. We had the Haskell client and then the Java folks. They were actually more interested in the Java folks. Wait, I should take a step back here. Just mentioning that DevCon 1 almost didn't happen if you recall because it was in this low period and the Ethereum Foundation was kind of running out of money because you know this is why the launch had to happen when it happened. And in that low period, they were like, you know, still trying to preserve a lot of cash. And so it almost didn't happen. And I remember like a lot of people inside ConsenSys were like, no, like we have to like bring this to, kind of bring this up and make an event out of this. You know, like I think Andrew Keys was leading the charge in that, really saying like we got to do this. And then this Microsoft thing kind of bundled into that. Right? So it was us and the Java client and my background was like, you know, in my previous company I had tried to work with Microsoft and building apps like when they had their first mobile platform. And it took me like six months to get a meeting and I had a cousin who was like a VP at Microsoft. So it was amazing to me that they were just coming to us and they wanted to launch something with us in two months. And I think at that point we decided, okay, this is a huge opportunity. We're going to drop everything and focus on that launch, which turned out to be launching Blockchain as a Service. But oddly enough, the Java guys started and then they just kind of faded away. They weren't really interested in kind of pursuing it. They just had other things going on. So we went over it. So by the time DevCon 1 happened, the only thing that was working was our client. It was ready on the cloud. You could download it and you could start building on it right away. And then remember we started to get downloads immediately. People started to get people using it immediately. But that's also in that run-up, that was when we realized, when Microsoft realized if we're going to make this as a developer tool, it can't connect to the public Ethereum network because people wouldn't be able to get Ether. Like it was quite hard to get Ether at that point. There weren't really that many exchanges or anything to go on. So we were, that's kind of how we kind of created like private Ethereum, you know, and private Enterprise, what what became known as private. If they were more Enterprise.

SPEAKER_03: That, that kind of all led up and then the launch itself in London. Um, when we got up with Microsoft, I think people were shocked that Microsoft was into it. You know, so, uh, I just looked that up and didn't have in our little outline. But I, I had forgotten about this. So I think Coinbase listed Ether like mid-2016, right? I'm seeing May 24th, 2016.

SPEAKER_00: So, and I, I guess like Kraken was the popular exchange at the time. You know, I think it was Poloniex. I'm sorry, you're right. Yeah, Poloniex still exists, and I just remember there was like the chat function on Poloniex and like, man, like that was like crazy. Like that was Discord before there was Discord.

SPEAKER_03: Oh, wait, hold on. Circle bought it, maybe, and then it seems to have shut it down. Anyway, I'm confused by all this, but yeah, so it was like it was sketchy for sure. Um, it was like a whale chat box. I never really used it, but I would like to see it on people's computers and all that sort of thing. It was, um, it was difficult to get it in and out of Ether for a while. Jim, are you gonna say something?

SPEAKER_01: I'm just kind of remembering back then. Remind me because I'm sort of like not sure if I've got this straight, but I think maybe you're downplaying the Java thing a little bit. I think if I remember right, Microsoft guys were pretty mad at that time. Am I misremembering that?

SPEAKER_00: No, you're not. Well, the thing is they really want something that they could pitch to companies, and you know, like, um, just, you know, companies use Java, right? So they were like really, and, um, so like when we kind of like, we're like, like we just dropped everything and just focused on that. And I remember like we sort of had the internal mantra like we gotta get on stage and be able to write a Dapp in like 30 seconds. Like that was our internal magic. They had like pre-announced something or something, and then the Java guys sort of disappeared or something. Yeah, they pre-announced that, you know, they were going to show like the Java client and the Haskell client. And we were like this. We were like the runner-up. Like they were like, I think they kind of accepted us because we were willing to work really hard. And the Java got like, I think they knew that they needed a backup.

SPEAKER_01: The other thing I, I remember about Microsoft is that there was a little bit of like, uh, um, uh, tension within there because there were the, they were just launching Azure at that time.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And at the same time, they had blockchain people and the blockchain people really wanted to focus on the blockchain side of it. And the Azure people wanted to like use this as a way to, to promote the new platform. So, so there was always a little bit of friction within.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, like I remember like I think the, you know, Marley Gray was really driving those efforts inside Microsoft at the time. And, um, like they were like really, really pushing it. And I remember like they were trying to get people in the room to talk to us and some of them weren't even, I mean, it was probably like you said, they were launching Azure. So that's a huge project. I'm sure they were just busy with other stuff. But we spent a lot of time in their New York office. I remember we were like going there all the time.

SPEAKER_03: I'm seeing the Azure launches 2010. I checked it, but it did feel much more nascent than it is today. Like Amazon got out, AWS got out there, and like took the whole market. And then Azure was kind of like in a catch-up mode, but I think it might've even like exceeded AWS revenues at some point.

SPEAKER_01: They were running around one of the conferences. I can't remember which one, handing out free passes to everyone.

SPEAKER_00: It was that conference, DevCon 1.

**[25:14] UNKNOWN:** Okay.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, they were, they were handing it out, and that's why they wanted to make sure we were on their marketplace. So like they could hand out this free pass and you could get the, you know, you could get the our client up and running and start building something right away. And that was like a revelation to a lot of people. I remember like dozens of companies were like starting in that first week. Their devious plan worked on us. That we grabbed a whole bunch of free, uh, passes and then a year later we were like giving them like ten thousand dollars a month to stay on it. It definitely works, but I guess yeah, yeah, but I don't know if you remember like that the day after the Microsoft announcement there was a spike in the price. And we were like.

SPEAKER_03: I think we just did the price. You mean the Microsoft stock price? No, no, no, I meant the Ethereum price. I think it was both actually, yeah. I think memory of the Microsoft stock price like slightly ticking. Yeah, I think they both went up, and we were like, hey, I think we actually did that. So like either went from 20 cents to 30 cents.

SPEAKER_00: Uh, no, I think it actually went significantly up. I, I remember like like it was, I think it might have like doubled for a day or something like that. 20 cents to 40 cents.

SPEAKER_03: Maybe, I think it was like a dollar to a dollar 80 or, I, I don't remember the price check it out. But it's hard to see it's funny, the price range is like so. Yes, because the price is, oh, okay, so it's interesting right so so DevCon's like December, right? Yeah, something like that. It's around a dollar. Yeah, there it is, see where it starts taking up like yeah and I think we definitely got calls related to the Microsoft announcement into January. Yeah, for sure. So we probably had something to do with it. You never know really what's causing price action.

SPEAKER_01: I'm joking, but I just remember sort of the mentality within was that until it was up to $20, people thought it was a flop. And somehow when it hit $20, everybody around me all of a sudden got really excited then.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. The average person, you know, buys high, sells low. So, yeah, that's pretty successful at 20. And it was still low. Okay, so moving along, kind of on the back of the enterprise announcement, sorry, the Microsoft announcement, we started to get customers. And a lot of it was like enterprises that were fairly early in their journey and wanted just some advice on blockchain technology. Some of them were actually ready to implement something. I don't know, Vic, you took a whole lot of phone calls.

SPEAKER_00: Oh, man, yeah.

SPEAKER_03: Do you want to comment on any of that?

SPEAKER_00: I mean, it was kind of amazing. Like now the numbers in relative size seem pretty small, but in the first couple months, we went from zero to like dozens of companies calling us, right? And, and the amazing thing to me was they had actually tried our software. Like they had played around, and like I remember over and over people were like, oh, you know, like we've been working on a blockchain project for the last two years and haven't been able to build anything. And now we can do something right. So I remember like we were getting them from financial companies and like, you know, um, uh, resource company and mining companies and like it was like all across the spectrum of people are trying things because I don't think they really knew what they wanted to do. But they wanted an easy way to get in, and for the first time, they had it. Gotcha. Um.

SPEAKER_03: Do you remember? So I believe I'm trying to keep this straight. So, um, I remember the project Slockit was sort of being marketed at DevCon 1, but I believe it's a lot of the same people as the DAO. And do you remember like I think they presented but I can't I'm having a hard time keeping it straight.

SPEAKER_00: So Slockit was this sort of IoT kind of strange thing that you could unlock a lock, but they, it was structured around what actually became the DAO. Like they, I think they invented the concept, not the concept, but I think they practically created a DAO in order to, their own, this lock. And then they realized well you know I, I think they realized well we don't actually need to lock like the DAO is the most important thing. And the lock, the actual lock thing is not that interesting. So yeah, it was 100 the same people. Like they were introducing both ideas at the same time.

SPEAKER_03: So let me transition into the DAO part. I'm going to go slightly out of order here. So Victor, what was the DAO?

SPEAKER_00: So the DAO was basically it was kind of like an investment fund on the Ethereum blockchain, right? So basically people would put like money into this contract and this contract would basically fund the, the goal of it was it would fund different projects. But it started to like consume a huge amount of, you know, the overall Ether supply. I think it was as high as like 20 or 25 percent of the entire Ether supply got locked up into this contract.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm looking on the Wikipedia right now. So the part of the reason I thought of it in this sequence is like looking at the price action. Part of it is that the supply, the extant Ether supply went down because, okay, so as of May 2016, the DAO had attracted nearly 14% of all Ether tokens issued to date. So they ran a crowd sale and that crowd sale raised $34 million. Um, 34 million by May 10th, 2016. Um, more than 50 by May 12th, over 100 by May 15th. So sometimes the, the, the dynamics of these ICOs, this is one thing one it's kind of crazy. But like one thing that blockchain seem to do that it's really difficult to do with other technologies is to have this sort of really large scale collaboration and in this case to pool capital basically. So I suppose there was some sort of virality going on. People are talking about the DAO, and you just see this like enormous movement of funds sort of overnight. And so okay they end up holding by May 21st, 2016 over $150 million in Ether from over 10,000 people which is about, it says according to the article about 14% of all Ether tokens issued at that time. So it was really fast right it took everybody to surprise I remember I think I had a meeting that the enterprise folks at ConsenSys had set up with I'm going to say the people at BBVA I'm forgetting last names but I think it was like Scarlett and Carlos I don't think you went to this one Vic you weren't in town they were just like it just caught everyone's attention it was crazy you know and they were we were talking a bit about like operational use cases for the bank um but then it was also like you know there was a sense that like this is where the future is like the money just moved you know like there were no really you know those heavy subscription agreements and you know all that sort of thing and you know it was also a cautionary tale of what was to come over the next couple years um yeah so by June people discovered that you could exploit the DAO to siphon off the funds yeah do you remember anything about that but beyond you know it was crazy.

SPEAKER_00: So so there were so you had all the supply locked into this contract and I think the hack was like yeah so there was this massive race between there was a flaw in the contract logic and because it's immutable the smart contract couldn't be changed right when people realized there was this massive race between the people who were trying to extract the money out of the contract and the people who actually worked on the DAO itself so it was like this and but the people who were successful at kind of extracting the money pulled out a lot of it like I think I I don't remember the number but I think it was like a huge amount of the value they were able to pull that out yeah now the the the ironic thing was that it got pulled out and put into an account and everyone knew where it went because you know everything on the blockchain is completely transparent but no one could do anything about it like they couldn't take the money out and so the money was just sitting there basically that got like it was like it got stolen and left on the side of the street or something and no one knew what to do about this situation.
