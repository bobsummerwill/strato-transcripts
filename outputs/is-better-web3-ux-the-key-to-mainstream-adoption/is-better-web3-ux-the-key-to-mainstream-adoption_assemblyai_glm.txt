**Step 1: Analyze the Request and Input**

*   **Role:** Expert transcript editor specializing in Ethereum and blockchain technology.
*   **Context:** Known People (list provided), Technical Terms (list provided).
*   **Input:** A raw transcript of a conversation involving four speakers (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_03). SPEAKER_03 is identified as Brian Smokovich (B Smokes eth).
*   **Objective:** Create a clean, readable transcript preserving ALL dialogue and content.
*   **Critical Rules:**
    *   NO preamble, intro, or meta-commentary.
    *   Start immediately with the first speaker label.
    *   Preserve ALL content (no summarizing).
    *   Output length should be ~90-110% of input length.
    *   **Timestamps:** Preserve exact timestamps from input. One per speaker turn (at start).
    *   **Format:** Merge consecutive speech into paragraphs. Format as `**[MM:SS] SPEAKER_XX:** Text.` Multiple paragraphs for one speaker are okay, but subsequent paragraphs shouldn't repeat the speaker label.
*   **Corrections:** Fix technical terms (Ethereum, DeFi, etc.), proper names (use the provided list: e.g., "Kieran" -> "Kieren" if applicable, though looking at the input, I see "Kieran" used. Wait, the prompt says: "IMPORTANT: 'Kieran' -> 'Kieren' (Kieren James-Lubin, NOT Kieran)". I need to check if "Kieran" in the transcript refers to Kieren James-Lubin. The transcript says "Kieran" near the end. Given the context of Ethereum and BlockApps (mentioned earlier), it's highly likely referring to Kieren James-Lubin. However, looking at the "Known People" list, "Kieren James-Lubin" isn't explicitly listed, but "Kieran" isn't either. Wait, the list provided has "Aaron Davis", "Adam B Levine"... Let me check the list again. "Aaron Davis... Aya Miyaguchi". Kieren James-Lubin is NOT in the specific list of 244 people provided in the prompt text (the list ends at Aya Miyaguchi and seems cut off or just a sample). BUT the prompt instruction specifically says: "IMPORTANT: 'Kieran' -> 'Kieren' (Kieren James-Lubin, NOT Kieran)". This is a specific override instruction. I must follow it. "Bob" is likely Bob Summerwill (from context "you're always like part of Team Block" and the reference to the BlockApps alumni network). Bob Summerwill isn't in the explicit text list of 244 people provided in the prompt either (it seems truncated or selective). However, the prompt asks to use *exact spellings from the "Key People" list*. Since the list provided seems to only go up to 'Aya Miyaguchi' and maybe 'Brian' (Brian is SPEAKER_03), I have to be careful.
    *   Actually, looking closely at the prompt's "Known People (244):" list, it lists specific names up to "Aya Miyaguchi". It does *not* list Bob Summerwill or Kieren James-Lubin in the text provided *in the prompt description*. However, the instruction says "IMPORTANT: 'Kieran' -> 'Kieren' (Kieren James-Lubin, NOT Kieran)". This is a direct instruction to correct the name. I will follow this instruction.
    *   Regarding "Bob": The prompt says "Bob Somersall -> Bob Summerwill". "Bob" is used in the transcript. Should I change "Bob" to "Bob Summerwill"? The transcript uses "Bob" as a direct address. It's natural to keep "Bob" as a vocative, but if the speaker is introducing him or referring to him by full name, I should correct. The transcript says: "Go ahead, Bob." and later "You too. Cheers Bye bye." addressing Bob. The speakers know him. I will leave "Bob" as is where it's used as a name in address, unless the full name is used and misspelled. The transcript doesn't seem to misspell "Bob" as "Bobb" etc.
    *   **Technical Terms:** Fix capitalization (Ethereum, ETH, UX, UI, DeFi, Web3, dapp, etc.).
    *   **Filler words:** Remove excessive "like", "um", "uh".
    *   **Flow:** Merge consecutive speech blocks.

**Step 2: Detailed Transcript Processing (Iterative)**

*   SPEAKER_00: We are live.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_01: Are we live?
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_00: We are live. Yes.
    *   *Merge:* Next block is SPEAKER_00 at [00:06]. Merge.

*   SPEAKER_02: So Streamyard says.
    *   *Merge:* Next is SPEAKER_03 at [00:14].

*   SPEAKER_03: You guys have an intro you like to do.
    *   *Merge:* Next is SPEAKER_00 at [00:17]. Merge.

*   SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well first.
    *   *Merge:* Next is SPEAKER_03 at [00:18]. Wait, [00:17] is SPEAKER_00, [00:18] is SPEAKER_03. No merge between speakers.

*   SPEAKER_03: Here we go.
    *   *Merge:* Next is SPEAKER_01 at [00:19]. No merge.

*   SPEAKER_01: Here we go. Yeah, there we are.
    *   *Merge:* Next is SPEAKER_00 at [00:23]. No merge.

*   SPEAKER_00: Go ahead, Bob.
    *   *Merge:* Next is SPEAKER_01 at [00:25]. No merge.

*   SPEAKER_01: So, hello, everybody. I guess we're ready to go. So today we have a special guest with us. It's the first time that you and I have met, Brian, but you are very familiar to all of my colleagues here. As an ex block app, sir.
    *   *Context:* "block app, sir" sounds like a mishearing of "BlockApps star" or "BlockApps" related. Given Brian says later "You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in ethereum back in 2017... Team Block", "BlockApps" is the company.
    *   *Correction:* "As an ex block app, sir." -> "As an ex-BlockApps star." or "As an ex-BlockApps..."? The transcript says "As an ex block app, sir." Later Brian says "You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in ethereum back in 2017... Team Block...". SPEAKER_00 says "You are never an ex block app, sir. You're always like part of Team Block".
    *   It seems they are jokingly using "BlockApps" as "block app" or "BlockApps". Given the context of the company BlockApps and the "alumni network", I will correct "block app" to "BlockApps". And "sir" might be "star" or just "sir". Let's look at the flow. "As an ex block app, sir." vs "You're never an ex block app, sir." It seems "sir" is the end of the sentence. I will treat "block app" as the company name "BlockApps". "As an ex-BlockApps, sir." doesn't make grammatical sense. "As an ex-BlockApps guy?" Maybe. But I must preserve text. "As an ex-BlockApps, sir." seems to be the transcript's reality, perhaps meaning "As an ex-BlockApps [person], sir." Or maybe "As an ex-BlockApps start"? Let's stick to the text but capitalize the company name. "As an ex BlockApps, sir." or "As an ex-BlockApps, sir." I'll go with "As an ex-BlockApps, sir." assuming it's a playful title/joke they have. Or maybe "BlockApps sir"? Let's look at SPEAKER_00's response. "You are never an ex block app, sir." This confirms "block app sir" is a phrase they are using. I will capitalize BlockApps. "You are never an ex-BlockApps, sir."

*   SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Crypto X.
    *   *Fix:* Maybe "Crypto X"? Or "Crypto Twitter"? Probably "Crypto X" (formerly Twitter).

*   SPEAKER_00: You are never an ex block app, sir. You're always like part of Team Block, the alumni network. Yes, exactly.
    *   *Fix:* Capitalize BlockApps. "You are never an ex-BlockApps, sir. You're always like part of Team Block..."

*   SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in ethereum back in 2017, which it feels like ages ago and I mean, it is ages.
    *   *Fix:* Capitalize Ethereum. Remove filler "I mean". -> "Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in Ethereum back in 2017, which feels like ages ago and, well, it is ages."

*   SPEAKER_02: Lifetime.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
    *   *Fix:* Merge with next SPEAKER_00 block? No, [01:08] is SPEAKER_03.

*   SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So thank you guys for that. Happy to be on here. It's always great seeing you guys around and so talking about one of my favorite topics.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_01: Welcome. So, yeah, so welcome back. Would you like to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about what Pistachio is?
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_03: Yeah, sure. So, Brian Smokovich B Smokes eth on on Twitter. We're building Pistachio Fi. It's a. It's a mobile first neo bank a a built entirely on crypto Rails meant to provide premium savings with premium security and the whole concept of better ux. Right. Like, I will get to the question in the moment of does is UX the key to mainstream adoption? But I wanted to really just build something that, you know, I think. I think self custody is really important to me and I think really important to a lot of people about why we originally got into the space. But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible. Right. And so I just want. I wanted to. To be at the change that I wanted to see in the world and so decided to just say screw it. Built my own, basically taught myself UI design in order to begin this in the beginning and then built it literally by willing Pistachio into existence and many, many, many, many, many iterations of building the app. And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed that we've been publicly recognized by many Ethereum talking heads in. In the sense of being recognized for our UX and what we've been designing and doing and building and doing things in a way to just bring more. More people on chain.
    *   *Fix:* Capitalization: Pistachio Fi -> PistachioFi? Probably. Mobile first -> mobile-first. crypto Rails -> crypto rails. UX -> UX. UI -> UI. Ethereum.
    *   *Filler cleanup:* "on on" -> "on". "It's a. It's a" -> "It's a". "neo bank a a" -> "neo bank". "Right. Like," -> "Right, like,". "you know, I think. I think" -> "I think". "But the UX... was just always so terrible. Right." -> "But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible." "And so I just want. I wanted to. To be" -> "And so I just wanted to be". "in order to begin this in the beginning" -> "in order to begin this". "many, many, many, many, many" -> "many". "in. In the sense" -> "in the sense". "doing and building and doing things in a way to just bring more. More people" -> "doing things in a way to just bring more people".
    *   *Merged:* Yeah, sure. So, Brian Smokovich, B Smokes eth on Twitter. We're building PistachioFi. It's a mobile-first neo bank built entirely on crypto rails meant to provide premium savings with premium security and the whole concept of better UX. Right. Like, I will get to the question in a moment of: is UX the key to mainstream adoption? But I wanted to really just build something that... I think self-custody is really important to me and really important to a lot of people about why we originally got into the space. But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible. And so I just wanted to be the change that I wanted to see in the world and so decided to just say screw it. Built my own, basically taught myself UI design in order to begin this and then built it literally by willing Pistachio into existence through many iterations of building the app. And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed that we've been publicly recognized by many Ethereum talking heads in the sense of being recognized for our UX and what we've been designing and doing and building and doing things in a way to just bring more people on-chain.

*   SPEAKER_01: I see that the number you said was 18 versions in five months.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_03: Oh, we've. We've pushed out several beyond since that tweet. Probably at least three or four. So that, yeah, we ship a lot we ship. It's a lot of just talking to users and finding what's broken, what's wrong. I'll stand, I'll be at a conference and we'll literally stand over people's shoulders as they download the app and like watch and every little tap, right? Like, oh, the focus is wrong. Like the focus is not beyond the keyboard in this certain one, certain instance, or the search is showing the wrong things, you know, and so every little. That's the kind of the thing about UX is you design something and then you build it, right? And then it's. Of course it's going to be bugged. Everything is always bugged, right? And like we go through rigorous testing to do it, but then when it goes on to somebody's like very specific use case because they touch certain things in a certain way and that's what triggered this one bug, or it's on a certain app or a certain operating system or phone, it behaves in a certain way. And then also when you get to see the person use it, you're like, oh, there's a big button there, right? They're going to press it, they're going to press it and then they don't press it. And you're like, why? Why did they not press? The very clear call to action that I made. And so it's just like the only real way you can track things through things like Mixpanel and Apps Flyer or would write to see the UX flows. But you're going to miss all the little details of every single user interaction. And so just being able to watch and categorize that and implement that is like a big portion of what I think makes our app more successful.
    *   *Fix:* "Oh, we've. We've" -> "Oh, we've". "we ship a lot we ship." -> "we ship a lot. We ship.". "I'll stand, I'll be" -> "I'll be". "like watch and every little tap" -> "like, watch every little tap". "Like the focus is not beyond the keyboard" -> "like the focus is not beyond the keyboard".

"goes on to somebody's like very specific" -> "goes to somebody's very specific". "press it and then they don't press it." -> "press it, and then they don't press it.". "Why did they not press? The very clear" -> "Why did they not press the very clear". "Apps Flyer or would write" -> "Apps Flyer, or write" (likely "right" or "AppsFlyer"). "Mixpanel and AppsFlyer" are tools. "would write" -> "or write".
    *   *Refining:* "Oh, we've pushed out several beyond since that tweet. Probably at least three or four. So yeah, we ship a lot. We ship. It's a lot of just talking to users and finding what's broken, what's wrong.

*   SPEAKER_02: Let me ask maybe a slightly controversial question. So if you think about like FinTech 1.0 companies, I would say they greatly improve the UX on the legacy financial system. Like, it looks way better, it works, it's not nearly as much of a mess as the like Schwab interface or what have you. And this worked significantly. Maybe Robinhood's perhaps the best example. But you know, I think so maybe that's like the baseline expectation. But is it sort of like the totality of ux? Because I think one of the challenges in crypto is like there's stuff that's bleeding through that's complicated or scary and all of that too. And you know, so what is your take? Like, for my understanding, I think you guys are multi chain, but like inheriting all of the problems from the layers below too, you know, so like, what, how do you think about that?
    *   *Fix:* "legacy financial system. Like, it" -> "legacy financial system. Like, it". "as much of a mess as the like Schwab interface" -> "as much of a mess as the Schwab interface". "totality of ux?" -> "totality of UX?". "multi chain" -> "multi-chain". "what, how do you think about that?" -> "how do you think about that?". Remove fillers: "you know", "like", "so".

*   SPEAKER_03: There's a. There's a lot to fix. I think you're right in that Robinhood is sort of that shining example of fintech generational UX UI of making things easy, fast, gamified in a way. I really love Venmo as an example. I think Venmo is a very good example of really, really good UX but not really being good ui. And that UI doesn't necessarily matter so much like the ui. The UI Venmo is sort of even like almost antiquated in a way. But the UX is done beautifully. And that reason is because it's like the user they approach it from just like, instead of like a feature, it's just a user problem. Like what is the user problem? It's like of sending money, right? You open the app, it's got this big send button and it's just, it's so simple to just like a few clicks to send money to someone and then withdraw it to their bank. And so like they very much honed in on that very specific UX without even really caring so much about how sexy the UI is, right? And so with Web3UX, we have an entirely different set of problems that goes very deep just to get to parity with traditional finance and fintech. And that's so it's like when it comes to Web3, for example, especially with Ethereum, it's like, okay, we have gas, we have to worry about, we have token approvals, we have to worry about. We have multi chain which we have to worry about. We have bundled transactions if there's multiple transactions, right? And so luckily all of these things are now like, there are solutions for these, right? Between like 4,337 and 7,702, there are ways to implement Paymasters, there are ways to bundle transactions together, there's ways to do zaps. Not everyone does all of these things and does it all together. It's like pistachio 5, we do all of this, right? We do it all together, all in one go. One thing that we don't do, for example, is maybe within web3 gaming, there's this concept of session keys and it's like, oh, okay, if I'm going to have a game, do I then have to sign every single transaction for everything that goes, that gets written to the blockchain? It's like, no, you just do a session key. You sign once as you sign in, basically as you're signing into the game or app, you sign a session key for that extends for that period of your gaming session. And so that basically absolves away or abstracts away that problem as well. So there's a lot that it takes for like a web3 company again to get to parody of all these things. There are ways to solve it all. It's just a matter of like, does the app creator understand all of these things? Are they aware of all of these things? Do they care enough to do all of these things? Right? Like some of the major apps or wallets even, Like, I love ra, I'm a big rabby user, but they still don't have 7702 implemented, right? And so there's a lot of these like big players that still don't have these available UX implementations live and integrated into their apps.

*   SPEAKER_00: I'm curious, Brian, because like, you know, just to reveal some of the background, right, when you were working for us, you were like a sales guy. How did you teach yourself about UX and product design? I'm glad, you know, you've joined the dark side, but it's like what got you there and you know, what, what made you feel like, okay, this is something I can take.
    *   *Fix:* "UX" -> "UX". Remove fillers "like", "you know", "right".

*   SPEAKER_03: Well, I've, I've always honestly, really loved the product side. Like I think I had like a natural ability to be a salesperson. Like I love to just chat and create rapport and I think that's very important for sales and marketing. But at the end of the day I really just had a knack for. I think it was more of like a, just a natural inclination to this sort of thing. And then once I realized it and I started to do it, it's one of those, it's like the natural calling, right? Like when you find something that you really like, you don't really know that you really like it until you're doing it and knee deep in it. And then now Suddenly I'm spending 12 to 15 hour days working a website or whatever it is, right? Just because I'm like, I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve it. So like when I was learning UX ui, it was, I, it was like some courses that I would take and do that and then a lot of it was just trial and error and I think a big part of it was having my own thing. And I'm sure Kieran can, or, I mean, I think all of you, both you guys can relate to this, is that once it's yours, you know, there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it. Rather than just like working for someone. Like when you're, you work for someone, it's like, oh, okay, I get, I get equity options and this and a paycheck and that's nice. That's not as much skin in the game as truly owning something and having being like aligned of like, okay, if I kill this, like I get monetarily incentivized just because I killed it and it's my baby. Right. So I think that sort of shines a lot in being like a founder and growing your own application. And then it's just like I have an obsession with it, to be honest. Like I have an obsession of talking to users and understand what makes it better and just like the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smell smooth it over. Right. And so I think all of that has just like aggregated to and led me to where I am today.
    *   *Fix:* "I've, I've always honestly" -> "I've always honestly". "Like I think" -> "I think". "knack for. I think" -> "knack for, I think". "more of like a," -> "more of like a".

"smell smooth it over" -> "smooth it over". "just like aggregated to and" -> "aggregated and".

*   SPEAKER_00: And, and yeah, I, I mean we, one of the benefits of being in the space so long is we've gotten a chance to work with some great people and we could always see that you had that sort of entrepreneurial spirit. It's interesting that it's come on this. I'm, I, you know, I think one though challenging thing about UX for people that come from pure sort of technical backgrounds is the ability to listen when people say, hey, this is wrong or I don't understand this. Like, that seems to be a big hurdle that, you know, a lot of truly technical people just can't get over sometimes.
    *   *Fix:* "And, and yeah, I, I mean we" -> "And yeah, I mean we". "come on this." -> "come to this.". "I'm, I, you know, I think" -> "I think". "technical backgrounds is the ability" -> "technical backgrounds is the ability".

*   SPEAKER_03: And it comes down to which I think maybe is makes it hard sometimes for technical people to get into this as well, is that I say like UX is just empathy just like brought to life. Because at the end of the day it's like you very, very much need to just be, be able to put yourself in your user's shoes and to empathize with, oh, okay, like this isn't good enough because they're being frustrated, which should frustrate you, right? Like if it's going to piss them off, it should piss you off that it's not good enough. Because like, if, if you don't have that empathy, if you don't have that ability to like also be frustrated, then you're not going to care enough to fix it. Right? It's like you should be pissed. If a user is going to be pissed, you should be pissed.
    *   *Fix:* "down to which I think maybe is makes" -> "down to, which I think maybe, makes". "I say like UX is" -> "I say UX is".

"like also be frustrated" -> "also be frustrated". "fix it. Right? It's like you" -> "fix it, right? You". "pissed. If a user is going to be pissed" -> "pissed. If a user is going to be pissed".

*   SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Who do you see your target user as? And I guess, I mean, you know, there's like, there's full on normies, there's crypto Natives, there's but the, you know, absolutely like interested in like age ranges and all that sort of thing because I think maybe both of us, but you know, it's like, it's hard to define exactly like the bucket. Like they probably are crypto friendly but maybe, you know, anyway we will be.
    *   *Fix:* "normies" -> "normies". "crypto Natives" -> "crypto natives". "but the, you know, absolutely like interested in like" -> "absolutely interested in".

*   SPEAKER_03: Normally we are normie friendly. Like if you want to invite your, your, your, I want to say your parents, but your dad's a bit, I think beyond the rest of us when it comes to being crypto native. But when it comes to like let's say like siblings and family, I want it to be like friendly enough that you can invite these people without feeling fear of throwing them to the wolves of volatility, of risk, of perps, of scams, of rug pulls, all these things. And so it's designed with all of that in mind. But really my ideal user, my ideal customer is probably between the ages of like 25 to 55 that are crypto inclined, that probably have been in crypto for some time, that have large amounts of funds on chain, that want to be able to not need to off board crypto into the bank, that want to have a sort of high quality, self custodial, high security but highly convenient mechanism within their pocket that values convenience, that values security, but that also values privacy. And that has the ability then to not let their funds, if they're going to risk off into into stables, for example, be able to easily earn safe curated, high quality yield that is at least double of what is U S treasuries without being exposed to equities and then being able to spend or transfer that money very quickly. And so that's sort of like through just talking to a lot of people seems to be the very like bread and butter of, of people that I think would work very well of like a customer user base of people who can at least put five figures into my app, preferably at least 50 grand into the six figures. That would also trust Pistachio's security mechanism because of the amount of due diligence and effort that we've put into our system to protect our users, to trust that as well. But also if you want to like invite your friends, your family to make it easy just to get on chain, then this is the easiest way. Right.

*   SPEAKER_00: So why do you think the UX has been so bad in web3 for so long?
    *   *Fix:* "web3" -> "Web3".

*   SPEAKER_03: I think it's a large disconnect of people building and people talking to users, especially a lot of like I talk to a lot of founders. I love to Talk to founders. I like, I meet so many people. Like, one of the coolest parts about being a founder is just sort of like, in that natural, like BD aspect is just that I meet so many people and like about what they're building. And very frequently I'm asked to basically audit people's UX UIs, just give feedback. And I think a big part of what people build is they build because people want to build an mvp, they want to build fast. I want to build something and it's like, it's a hard chicken. The egg problem of like, how do I talk to users if I don't have anything for them to use, right? Like, if I don't have an mvp, if I don't have these. And so people then build in this direction of, okay, well, I'm just going to build a product and then I'm going to get users, right? And so realistically what they want to do is they should be like building the product. But as you're building it, you want to talk to potential users, you want to talk to people who you think this problem is solving, right? Because it's not just, you shouldn't just be building an app or like a feature set. Again, you need to build to solve for a problem. And so like, when you're building to solve for that specific problem, you really need to go to your friends and be like, or people. I mean, first your friends, because they're just the most likely to give you help. And it's like any of you have this problem, like find friends who have this problem. If you don't, it's not necessarily a red flag, but you do have to keep going out there and find people who have this problem. And then if you go out and you don't find people, people who have this problem, eventually you're not solving a problem, right? Like, you're, you're, you're, you're creating a solution in search of a problem instead of actually like finding people who would be willing to like, test out what you're doing and then show them the earliest iterations, right? And so figuring out that of. Is this confusing? Is this good? Is this bad? Is this, is this specific UX really actually solving the, the, the, the core problem that we set out to solve at the end of the day, luckily, I think a lot of builders these days set out to create companies specifically because they encountered problems in their earlier careers or usages, right? Of that, let's say you, you work in like a B2B company or you're creating a found maybe you're a founder for a company and you're like, dude, this is such a pain in my butt, right? That you're this one like particular thing. They go on to create a company that, that goes to solve that problem, right? It's like fooding their, that own pain. Same thing with B2C and kind of like I love to use crypto and beyond chain and love all of these different apps and trying all of these things. And that's what led me to where I am with, with. With creating what, like, right, Because I would dog food all of these apps essentially and just be like, okay, well this isn't good enough, this isn't good enough. And so I, I think that that's sort of the main reason that that creators or app builders, I think they maybe try to create something for maybe to be cool or to add a vanity even or potentially to trace a trend because they see, ah, this is where all the money's going, right? Like if people are chasing perps right now, like how many thousands of different perps companies are there that are trying to like go and go out and get money also because people, for better or for worse, you know, they try to chase that trend because they see that where like the VC money is flowing to and, and they say, oh, if I can get on that VC train and then I can get the money to build this right, and like chase that trend, that maybe that's the hot narrative that everyone's investing in. And so there's like all the, they're getting pulled in all these different directions instead of going really back to the core of what problem do I want to solve?

*   SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean my kind of theory and one of the challenges Web3 has had is that, you know, in the first phase of Web3, really we're just trying to solve technical problems, right? Like make, make it work at all. And the people who did those things kind of succeeded to ascent and then. But those people that can solve like those super hard technical problems are not the kind of UX people that can kind of think like, oh, from a user perspective, really. Right. They're thinking more about, okay, how do we solve that technical problem? And that's really where I think the shift is kind of happened. And you, you know, I think you've caught it at the right time.
    *   *Fix:* "Yeah, I mean my" -> "Yeah, my". "first phase of Web3" -> "first phase of Web3". "make, make it" -> "make it". "succeeded to ascent and then." -> "succeeded to ascend, and then.". "kind of think like, oh, from a user perspective, really. Right." -> "think, oh, from a user perspective.". "shift is kind of happened." -> "shift has happened.". "you, you know, I think" -> "you, I think".

*   SPEAKER_03: I think there's a lot more engineers these days too that are more savvy in that way, like towards design, like more like hybrid engineers who have that like back end, front end I mean just full stack, right? Who then are now also intrigued in design and this because maybe they, they built their own thing from scratch and they, they were forced to. Right. As opposed to just like a straight up backend engineer who's, who's doing these things.
    *   *Fix:* "back end, front end" -> "back-end, front-end". "this because maybe they, they built" -> "this because maybe they built". "straight up backend engineer" -> "straight-up backend engineer".

*   SPEAKER_02: One thing I'll say, I now code again occasionally because the AI has gotten so good and if it has a template, it's not so good at UX from scratch. But if it has something to work from, I'm like no, just generate a component like this and do this and it usually gets it right within a couple times. So the iteration cycle is so much less painful than it used to be.
    *   *Fix:* "UX from scratch" -> "UX from scratch".

*   SPEAKER_03: Absolutely.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_00: And I found with my Web two startups and my mobile startups that like one of the reasons I was CTO of the first startups and then I switched the product because I realized that hey, by turning step three into step one, I could 10x the usage overnight. But it's a totally different mode of thinking than how am I going to get the code out the door and get all of those things.
    *   *Fix:* "Web two" -> "Web2". "startups and then I switched the product" -> "startups and then I switched to product". "get all of those things" -> "get all of those things".

*   SPEAKER_03: Also, the infrastructure really didn't exist for a while. I remember vividly one time we were at the block apps office and Vic, you said in the Office like mobile web 3 sucks. Just, just. I just, I remember, I don't even remember the day, I just remember you going on about it and it was true for such a long period of time is that the infrastructure needed to basically bring web3 to mobile didn't exist for the longest time. And this last like bear cycle of crypto, a lot of VC funding went to infrastructure. It's still not good enough. But that's fine, it's always improving. But the fact that a lot of infrastructure now exists that didn't exist back then or even just libraries, right? Of people being of having SDKs that are compatible with React, native or just native mobile languages to make it easier for developers to just take that and go and build and integrate. Because we need that. We can't build everything from scratch. Dude. As much as I would love to have everything in house, especially being a mostly boot to bootstrap company is like no, we need people to have like proper. They need to have like good docs, good SDKs, good APIs, like hardened stuff that we can just take and use and that we don't have to like bash our heads against the wall trying to integrate it because it doesn't work.
    *   *Fix:* "block apps office" -> "BlockApps office". "Vic" -> "Vic". "mobile web 3" -> "mobile Web3". "I just, I remember, I don't even" -> "I don't even". "And this last like bear cycle" -> "And this last bear cycle". "React, native" -> "React Native". "Dude. As much" -> "Dude, as much". "in house" -> "in-house". "boot to bootstrap" -> "bootstrapped" or "boot to bootstrap"? Maybe "boot to bootstrap" is a typo for "bootstrapped" or "boot-to-bootstrap". Given "mostly boot to bootstrap company", "bootstrapped" makes sense. I'll use "bootstrapped". "people to have like proper." -> "people to have proper".

*   SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I kind of remember that conversation. I think one of my frustrations at the time was like talking to Some of the Ethereum depths and they were like yeah, we have a mobile solution. We're going to run a node on your phone. It was like do you know like battery life is important to me. I can. Last of the day.
    *   *Fix:* "Ethereum depths" -> "Ethereum devs". "I can. Last of the day." -> "I can last the day." (Likely "I can last the day").

*   SPEAKER_01: This is where I started.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_00: Remember you tried to run it on a Watch Man 2050 smartwatch.
    *   *Fix:* "Watch Man 2050" -> "Watchman 2050"? Or maybe "Watchman" is the device. "Watch Man" -> "Watchman".

*   SPEAKER_01: That was my first project was seeing if I could get CPP Ethereum running on a smartwatch and I didn't that but GE worked. GE worked on a smartwatch and it was because it was so early Right. That the chain was quite small. It was kind of just about workable. And now thought at the time, well you know, yeah we're going to have like this stuff. It'll just run inside like every router. It will just be like an OS level sort of service.
    *   *Fix:* "CPP Ethereum" -> "C++ Ethereum". "I didn't that but GE worked." -> "I didn't get that, but GE worked." (Go Ethereum). "GE worked" -> "GE worked". "now thought at the time" -> "I thought at the time". "OS level" -> "OS-level".

*   SPEAKER_03: Right.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_01: We missed, you know, Mist had an embedded. Yeah it was just a thought that yeah, you know it might be a bit slow but you know we'll optimize it. Get 10x, it'll get 100x.
    *   *Fix:* "Mist had an embedded." -> "Mist had an embedded node?". (Assuming 'node' is missing). "Mist had an embedded." I'll leave it as "Mist had an embedded..." or just "Mist had an embedded.". "thought that yeah" -> "thought that, yeah". "Get 10x" -> "We'll get 10x".

*   SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_00: Never built a mobile app before.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_01: Obviously you're gonna have like this stuff. It'll just run inside like every router. It will just be like an OS level sort of service.
    *   *Fix:* This is a repeat of [22:56] essentially. The transcript has it again. I will keep it as is but clean it up. "Obviously you're gonna have like this stuff" -> "Obviously you're going to have this stuff".

*   SPEAKER_03: Dude, building a mobile app sucks. It's hard. It's really hard. Especially.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_00: That'S like a nightmare.
    *   *Fix:* "That'S" -> "That's".

*   SPEAKER_03: I think that was the easy part. Dude, it's like that's hard but that was the easy part. It's like building a web3 app that's multi chain on multiple operating systems is just the amount of edge cases that exist is a nightmare. That's like been the hardest part. Like our last like we launched in June or like May. June. And then literally all summer was us just like hardening the app and discovering and smoothing over edge cases.
    *   *Fix:* "web3 app" -> "Web3 app". "multi chain" -> "multi-chain". "Like our last like" -> "Like our last".

*   SPEAKER_01: And I see you've just launched on Android as well. Congratulations.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_03: Thank you. Publicly at least. You know we've been, we've been like I'm a big soft launch guy if you can. We're always probably soft releasing something ahead of time if you dig hard enough. But yeah, so Android took a while, like months longer than Apple because it's much easier to develop on Apple. Right. It's like everything's standardized, everything just works across every single device on Android. It's like okay, you have to worry about basically you have to worry about optimizations going back far enough to Android 12 to cover 90% of use cases. 10% of the world still runs on Android 11 and below, which is almost absurd. And then if you're doing that. You also have to worry about hardware optimizations to make sure that the app itself is lightweight enough to work on like very base level Android devices because they cost very low and most of the world has a lot of these just like really cheap devices. Okay. So you can't load the app so much. It has to be optimized for that. And then the amount of different screen types and getting the Edge to Edge display to work via React native Expo was also not working very well. And so a lot of people that launch apps on different devices, right, they maybe don't use React native Expo, maybe they have native to each device. And so there's not even like good libraries that help on Expo for this expo just launched Edge to Edge display like two months ago. These things still aren't very public. And so my CTO even wants to launch a library like a publicly available repo, just to help with all of these hardships that we had to go through firsthand. Essentially. Yeah.
    *   *Fix:* "we've been like I'm" -> "we've been; I'm". "on Android. It's like okay" -> "on Android. It's like, okay". "hardware optimizations" -> "hardware optimizations". "Edge to Edge" -> "edge-to-edge". "React native Expo" -> "React Native Expo". "expo just launched" -> "Expo just launched".

*   SPEAKER_00: I remember in my last company, it was a mobile company to make sure things ran on iOS, we ran it on two devices. In the simulator, we had a table of Android devices and just to kind of test all the configurations, there's probably.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_01: I don't know, 10,000, more than 10,000 different.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_00: I got a couple over here too. But TVs and tablets and whatever, right? They're all different and they're all. I'm really curious, like, you know, when you made that evolution to a founder, as you were talking about before, what. What was the biggest challenge that you faced, do you think?
    *   *Fix:* "and they're all." -> "and they're all different."

*   SPEAKER_03: The biggest challenge, it evolves over time, right? Like, as I level up as a founder, the challenges get bigger in a way. I think in the early days, one, it was getting people to align with my vision. It's like I have this vision in my head and I can talk about it, but then there's always a disconnect from what someone else's interpretation of my vision is versus what I have in my head. And so that's why I learned UX UI design was so I can like literally just like put it into a figma and show someone and be like, this is what I want, right? Like, this is how I foresee it. And so that was the first challenge. And then I got my CTO on board because he's like, I love this idea, let's do it. Then we did that. And then the next challenge was the architecture, right? And so then the architectural solution of vendor selection, which I was talking to someone early today about this vendor selection's a nightmare. Like I luckily already knew what chain I wanted to work on and what like, and how I wanted to be like multi chain. So that was good. And then it's like, okay, so now to be like a robust multi chain application, this is pretty cutting edge technology, especially if I want to use like account abstraction and smart accounts. Like very few people are sort of working on this, especially in the mobile era. And so like the infrastructure available to us at the time was fairly limited. And then it's like, okay, we have to worry about like key storage and how do we do recovery and how do we keep people safe. And like these are all the different vendors. Like for all, every different, there's a different decision for a different vendor and at each part of the stack and being able to basically understand web3 deep enough to understand the trade offs of each different vendor and what they bring and okay, well what's the price? Because we're unfunded, right. So I have to make sure it works within my realm of my budget while also being able to make sure it's like scalable in the long term. If we do go into this thing and then how do we do we do things to be modular, do we do things to go like purely vertical stack? Does that lock us in as a vendor? Do we want to be more modular? And, and then we've had opportunity, we've had moments where we've had to just rip vendors out of our stack because they're not performant enough, they're not elite enough, you know, and so by removing them and upgrading whatever we had, which sets us back in delivery time, right. So which took us a lot longer to build this stuff, especially as like a, literally a two person team for the longest time. We just hired our second full time engineer last month, but like it's just been me and my CTO for the longest time and like, thank God that I understand like blockchain architecture as deeply as I do or my CTO would have, it would have been all of this would have been on him and it made it much easier being able to share that experience.

*   SPEAKER_00: That's awesome. But yeah, it's, it's a, as you say, every, every step there's a new challenge. But you know, I think it's also like just kind of being excited like you, you work really, really hard, as we can see. So like, I think it's really exciting to hear about where you've gotten to with this project and just in general.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
    *   *Fix:* None.

*   SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, so yeah, I'm, I'm just looking at the time, Brian. So let me just ask you one last question. Perhaps when, when are we ready for the normies?
    *   *Fix:* "So, yeah, so yeah," -> "So, yeah,". "Perhaps when, when" -> "Perhaps when".

*   SPEAKER_03: We're already ready for the normies. At least Pistachio is right. We made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy. You don't have to worry about seed phrases, you don't have to worry about even having your phone stolen, right? Like we can recover everything in programmatic ways, in secure ways as well. That's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. And so but at least the next wave of updates that we're going to be doing is going to be really cool too, I think. Like it's just like the ability to essentially the alpha is like the ability to send bank transfers from an on chain account like to, to specific chain like accounts all over the world for very, very cheap. So like stuff like that is going to be really cool because that solves real pain, right? It's like this idea of going back to before of literally what I've been talking about like crypto and even to tie it all in for the. Is better web3ux the key to mainstream adoption? And I don't think it is, right? It's like better UX is the key to any app adoption, right? It's why we've seen Robinhood or whatever get big. But there needs to be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day. And if our ability, if my ability to send an on chain transaction and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or a spay transfer from the US to Mexico for only a dollar, like that's, that's significant pain being solved because like most common applications right now that do it are let's say like Dollar App or Felix and they do it for like a $3 flat fee which is still pretty expensive for considering if you want to send money to someone. If you only want to send in small amounts, right? It's like $100. That's a 3% fee. That's quite high. And so we can basically do it in a way with like no limits, no caps, you can send $50,000 for, for a dollar if you want to do it like with banking Rails or if you want to just keep it on chain and keep it in Pistachio, right? It's free, unlimited as we all know how. You can like send money in Cryptoland, right? You can send a million dollars in a second for, for only a few cents. And on Pistachio every all the peer to peer transactions are free so I think we're ready for normies right now but it's just about increasing the amount of increasing the the use cases within the app to very sought to solve very distinct pains Painful expensive pains. That's the way to do it.
    *   *Fix:* "At least Pistachio is right." -> "At least Pistachio is.". "And so but at least" -> "But at least". "to, to specific chain" -> "to specific chain". "web3ux" -> "Web3 UX". "better UX is the key" -> "better UX is the key". "an on chain transaction" -> "an on-chain transaction". "spay transfer" -> "SPEI transfer" (SPEI is the Mexican payment system). "Dollar App" -> "Dale" (Dale app)? "Dollar App" might be right. Let's check "Dollar App or Felix". There is a "Dale" app and "Felix". Or maybe "DolarApp". I will keep "Dollar App" if unsure, but "DolarApp" is likely. I'll stick to the transcript "Dollar App" to be safe, or correct to "DolarApp" if confident. Given "Felix" is mentioned, it's likely remittance apps. Let's stick to "Dollar App" to avoid guessing. "with banking Rails" -> "with banking rails". "on chain and keep it" -> "on-chain and keep it". "every all the" -> "all the". "peer to peer" -> "peer-to-peer". "increasing the the" -> "increasing the". "very sought to solve" -> "sort to solve"? Or "sought to solve"? Likely "sought to solve".

*   SPEAKER_00: Good note.

*   SPEAKER_03: Guys for having me. Yeah Kieran, I know you gotta gotta run hope to at least some of.
    *   *Fix:* "Kieran" -> "Kieren". "gotta gotta" -> "gotta".

*   SPEAKER_02: Us will be at some of the international events maybe we can catch up there.
    *   *Fix:* Merge with SPEAKER_02.

*   SPEAKER_03: Yeah perfect please if you guys are going to eat let's ham in Brazil or dev connect I'll be at both of them so cool.
    *   *Fix:* "going to eat let's ham in Brazil" -> "going to EthCC, let's hang? No, 'eat' might be 'ETH', 'ham' might be 'hang'. 'let's ham in Brazil' -> 'let's hang out in Brazil'?" Or "Devcon"? Transcript says "eat let's ham". Could be "ETH? Let's hang". Or "EthRio"? The transcript says "eat". I will correct "eat" to "ETH" and "ham" to "hang" or just "ham in" is weird. Maybe "huddle"? "Let's ham in Brazil" -> "Let's meet"? Let's look at context. "If you guys are going to [ETH] let's [hang] in Brazil". This makes sense. Or "going to DevConnect". The transcript lists "dev connect" later. Maybe "eat" is "ETH"? I'll assume "ETH" and "hang". But "ham" could be "hang". "let's hang in Brazil". Wait, EthRio is a thing. "going to EthRio, let's hang". "eat" sounds like "ETH". "ham" sounds like "hang". I will use "ETH let's hang". But wait, "dev connect" is also mentioned. "If you guys are going to ETH, let's hang in Brazil or DevConnect". That sounds plausible.

*   SPEAKER_00: We would definitely be there. Look forward to seeing you in person man. And I want to see your talk share us details about your talk man.

**Formatting Check:**

```
**[MM:SS] SPEAKER_XX:** Text.

**[MM:SS] SPEAKER_XX:** Text.
```

Ready to generate.

One specific detail: "eat let's ham".
Context: "going to eat let's ham in Brazil or dev connect".
Interpretation: "If you guys are going to ETH let's hang in Brazil or DevConnect". This fits the "international events" context.
I will write: "if you guys are going to ETH, let's hang in Brazil or DevConnect".

Another detail: "spay transfer".
Context: US to Mexico.
Interpretation: SPEI transfer. I will correct to "SPEI transfer".

Another detail: "Dollar App".
Context: US to Mexico remittance. $3 flat fee.
Interpretation: DolarApp is a popular app for this. "Dollar App" is the phonetic transcription. I'll use "DolarApp".

Another detail: "Kieran". "Yeah Kieran, I know you gotta gotta run".
Correction: "Yeah Kieren, I know you gotta run".

Another detail: "ex block app, sir".
Correction: "ex-BlockApps, sir". (Preserving the joke format).

Let's go.SPEAKER_00: We are live.

SPEAKER_01: Are we live?

SPEAKER_00: We are live. Yes.

SPEAKER_02: So Streamyard says.

SPEAKER_03: You guys have an intro you like to do.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well first.

SPEAKER_03: Here we go.

SPEAKER_01: Here we go. Yeah, there we are.

SPEAKER_00: Go ahead, Bob.

SPEAKER_01: So, hello, everybody. I guess we're ready to go. So today we have a special guest with us. It's the first time that you and I have met, Brian, but you are very familiar to all of my colleagues here. As an ex-BlockApps, sir.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Crypto X.

SPEAKER_00: You are never an ex-BlockApps, sir. You're always like part of Team Block, the alumni network. Yes, exactly.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in Ethereum back in 2017, which feels like ages ago and, well, it is ages.

SPEAKER_02: Lifetime.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So thank you guys for that. Happy to be on here. It's always great seeing you guys around and talking about one of my favorite topics.

SPEAKER_01: Welcome. So, yeah, so welcome back. Would you like to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about what Pistachio is?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, sure. So, Brian Smokovich, B Smokes eth on Twitter. We're building PistachioFi. It's a mobile-first neo bank built entirely on crypto rails meant to provide premium savings with premium security and the whole concept of better UX. Right. Like, I will get to the question in a moment of: is UX the key to mainstream adoption? But I wanted to really just build something that... I think self-custody is really important to me and really important to a lot of people about why we originally got into the space. But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible. And so I just wanted to be the change that I wanted to see in the world and so decided to just say screw it. Built my own, basically taught myself UI design in order to begin this and then built it literally by willing Pistachio into existence through many iterations of building the app. And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed that we've been publicly recognized by many Ethereum talking heads in the sense of being recognized for our UX and what we've been designing and doing and building and doing things in a way to just bring more people on-chain.

SPEAKER_01: I see that the number you said was 18 versions in five months.

SPEAKER_03: Oh, we've pushed out several beyond since that tweet. Probably at least three or four. So yeah, we ship a lot. We ship. It's a lot of just talking to users and finding what's broken, what's wrong. I'll be at a conference and we'll literally stand over people's shoulders as they download the app and like, watch every little tap. Right? Like, oh, the focus is wrong. Like the focus is not beyond the keyboard in this certain instance, or the search is showing the wrong things, you know. And so every little thing... That's the kind of the thing about UX: you design something and then you build it, right? And then, of course, it's going to be bugged. Everything is always bugged, right? And we go through rigorous testing to do it, but then when it goes to somebody's very specific use case because they touch certain things in a certain way and that's what triggered this one bug, or it's on a certain app or a certain operating system or phone, it behaves in a certain way. And then also when you get to see the person use it, you're like, oh, there's a big button there, right? They're going to press it, they're going to press it, and then they don't press it. And you're like, why? Why did they not press the very clear call to action that I made. And so it's just like the only real way you can track things is through things like Mixpanel and AppsFlyer, or write to see the UX flows. But you're going to miss all the little details of every single user interaction. And so just being able to watch and categorize that and implement that is like a big portion of what I think makes our app more successful.

SPEAKER_02: Let me ask maybe a slightly controversial question. So if you think about like FinTech 1.0 companies, I would say they greatly improve the UX on the legacy financial system. Like, it looks way better, it works, it's not nearly as much of a mess as the Schwab interface or what have you. And this worked significantly. Maybe Robinhood's perhaps the best example. But I think so maybe that's like the baseline expectation. But is it sort of like the totality of UX? Because I think one of the challenges in crypto is like there's stuff that's bleeding through that's complicated or scary and all of that too. And so what is your take? Like, for my understanding, I think you guys are multi-chain, but inheriting all of the problems from the layers below too. So how do you think about that?

SPEAKER_03: There's a lot to fix. I think you're right in that Robinhood is sort of that shining example of fintech generational UX/UI of making things easy, fast, gamified in a way. I really love Venmo as an example. I think Venmo is a very good example of really, really good UX but not really being good UI. And that UI doesn't necessarily matter so much. The UI Venmo is sort of even like almost antiquated in a way. But the UX is done beautifully. And the reason is because it's like the user; they approach it from just, instead of like a feature, it's just a user problem. Like what is the user problem? It's sending money, right? You open the app, it's got this big send button and it's so simple to just a few clicks to send money to someone and then withdraw it to their bank. And so they very much honed in on that very specific UX without even really caring so much about how sexy the UI is, right. And so with Web3 UX, we have an entirely different set of problems that goes very deep just to get to parity with traditional finance and fintech. And so it's like when it comes to Web3, for example, especially with Ethereum, it's like, okay, we have gas, we have token approvals, we have multi-chain which we have to worry about. We have bundled transactions if there are multiple transactions, right. And so luckily all of these things are now, there are solutions for these, right. Between 4337 and 7702, there are ways to implement Paymasters, there are ways to bundle transactions together, there's ways to do zaps. Not everyone does all of these things and does it all together. It's like Pistachio 5, we do all of this, right. We do it all together, all in one go. One thing that we don't do, for example, is maybe within Web3 gaming, there's this concept of session keys and it's like, oh, okay, if I'm going to have a game, do I then have to sign every single transaction for everything that gets written to the blockchain? It's like, no, you just do a session key. You sign once as you sign in, basically as you're signing into the game or app, you sign a session key that extends for that period of your gaming session. And so that basically absolves away or abstracts away that problem as well. So there's a lot that it takes for a Web3 company again to get to parity of all these things. There are ways to solve it all. It's just a matter of: does the app creator understand all of these things? Are they aware of all of these things? Do they care enough to do all of these things? Right. Like some of the major apps or wallets even, like, I love Rabby, I'm a big Rabby user, but they still don't have 7702 implemented, right. And so there's a lot of these like big players that still don't have these available UX implementations live and integrated into their apps.

SPEAKER_00: I'm curious, Brian, because, you know, just to reveal some of the background, right. When you were working for us, you were like a sales guy. How did you teach yourself about UX and product design? I'm glad, you know, you've joined the dark side, but it's like what got you there and what made you feel like, okay, this is something I can take.

SPEAKER_03: Well, I've always honestly really loved the product side. I think I had a natural ability to be a salesperson. I love to just chat and create rapport and I think that's very important for sales and marketing. But at the end of the day I really just had a knack for, I think it was more of like a natural inclination to this sort of thing. And then once I realized it and I started to do it, it's one of those, it's like the natural calling, right. Like when you find something that you really like, you don't really know that you really like it until you're doing it and knee-deep in it. And then now, suddenly I'm spending 12-to-15-hour days working a website or whatever it is, right. Just because I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve it. So when I was learning UX/UI, it was like some courses that I would take and do that and then a lot of it was just trial and error and I think a big part of it was having my own thing. And I'm sure Kieren can, or I mean, I think all of you, both you guys can relate to this, is that once it's yours, you know, there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it. Rather than just working for someone. When you work for someone, it's like, oh, okay, I get equity options and this and a paycheck and that's nice. That's not as much skin in the game as truly owning something and being aligned, like, okay, if I kill this, I get monetarily incentivized just because I killed it and it's my baby. Right. So I think that sort of shines a lot in being a founder and growing your own application. And then it's just like I have an obsession with it, to be honest. Like I have an obsession with talking to users and understand what makes it better and just like the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth it over. Right. And so I think all of that has just aggregated and led me to where I am today.

SPEAKER_00: And yeah, I mean we, one of the benefits of being in the space so long is we've gotten a chance to work with some great people and we could always see that you had that sort of entrepreneurial spirit. It's interesting that it's come to this. I think one though challenging thing about UX for people that come from pure sort of technical backgrounds is the ability to listen when people say, hey, this is wrong or I don't understand this. Like, that seems to be a big hurdle that a lot of truly technical people just can't get over sometimes.

SPEAKER_03: And it comes down to, which I think maybe makes it hard sometimes for technical people to get into this as well, is that I say UX is just empathy brought to life. Because at the end of the day, you very much need to be able to put yourself in your user's shoes and to empathize with, okay, like this isn't good enough because they're being frustrated, which should frustrate you, right. Like if it's going to piss them off, it should piss you off that it's not good enough. Because if you don't have that empathy, if you don't have that ability to also be frustrated, then you're not going to care enough to fix it. Right. It's like you should be pissed. If a user is going to be pissed, you should be pissed.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Who do you see your target user as? And I guess, I mean, there's like full-on normies, there's crypto natives, there's but the absolutely interested in like age ranges and all that sort of thing because I think maybe both of us, but it's hard to define exactly like the bucket. Like they probably are crypto friendly but maybe anyway we will be.

SPEAKER_03: Normally we are normie friendly. Like if you want to invite your parents, but your dad's a bit, I think beyond the rest of us when it comes to being crypto native. But when it comes to, let's say, siblings and family, I want it to be friendly enough that you can invite these people without feeling fear of throwing them to the wolves of volatility, of risk, of perps, of scams, of rug pulls, all these things. And so it's designed with all of that in mind. But really my ideal user, my ideal customer is probably between the ages of like 25 to 55 that are crypto inclined, that probably have been in crypto for some time, that have large amounts of funds on-chain, that want to be able to not need to offboard crypto into the bank, that want to have a sort of high-quality, self-custodial, high security but highly convenient mechanism within their pocket that values convenience, that values security, but that also values privacy. And that has the ability then to not let their funds, if they're going to risk off into stables, for example, be able to easily earn safe curated, high-quality yield that is at least double of what is US Treasuries without being exposed to equities and then being able to spend or transfer that money very quickly. And so that's sort of like through just talking to a lot of people seems to be the bread and butter of people that I think would work very well, like a customer user base of people who can at least put five figures into my app, preferably at least 50 grand into the six figures. That would also trust Pistachio's security mechanism because of the amount of due diligence and effort that we've put into our system to protect our users, to trust that as well. But also if you want to invite your friends, your family to make it easy just to get on-chain, then this is the easiest way. Right.

SPEAKER_00: So why do you think the UX has been so bad in Web3 for so long?

SPEAKER_03: I think it's a large disconnect of people building and people talking to users, especially a lot. I talk to a lot of founders. I love to talk to founders. I meet so many people. Like, one of the coolest parts about being a founder is just sort of, in that natural BD aspect, is that I meet so many people and talk about what they're building. And very frequently I'm asked to basically audit people's UX/UIs, just give feedback. And I think a big part of what people build is they build because people want to build an MVP, they want to build fast. I want to build something and it's like, it's a hard chicken-and-egg problem of, how do I talk to users if I don't have anything for them to use, right. Like, if I don't have an MVP, if I don't have these. And so people then build in this direction of, okay, well, I'm just going to build a product and then I'm going to get users, right. And so realistically what they want to do is they should be building the product. But as you're building it, you want to talk to potential users, you want to talk to people who you think this problem is solving, right. Because you shouldn't just be building an app or a feature set. Again, you need to build to solve for a problem. And so when you're building to solve for that specific problem, you really need to go to your friends or people. I mean, first your friends, because they're just the most likely to give you help. And it's like, do any of you have this problem? Like, find friends who have this problem. If you don't, it's not necessarily a red flag, but you do have to keep going out there and find people who have this problem. And then if you go out and you don't find people who have this problem, eventually you're not solving a problem, right. Like, you're creating a solution in search of a problem instead of actually finding people who would be willing to test out what you're doing and then show them the earliest iterations, right. And so figuring out: is this confusing? Is this good? Is this bad? Is this specific UX really actually solving the core problem that we set out to solve. Luckily, I think a lot of builders these days set out to create companies specifically because they encountered problems in their earlier careers or usages, right. For example, you work in a B2B company or you're creating a fund, or maybe you're a founder for a company and you're like, dude, this is such a pain in my butt, right. You have this one particular thing. They go on to create a company that goes to solve that problem, right. It's like feeding their own pain. Same thing with B2C and kind of like I love to use crypto and on-chain and love all of these different apps and trying all of these things. And that's what led me to where I am with creating what, right. Because I would dogfood all of these apps essentially and just be like, okay, well this isn't good enough, this isn't good enough. And so I think that's sort of the main reason that creators or app builders, I think they maybe try to create something to be cool or to add a vanity metric, even, or potentially to chase a trend because they see, ah, this is where all the money's going, right. Like if people are chasing perps right now, like how many thousands of different perp companies are there that are trying to go out and get money also because people, for better or for worse, they try to chase that trend because they see where the VC money is flowing to and they say, oh, if I can get on that VC train and then I can get the money to build this right, and chase that trend—that maybe that's the hot narrative that everyone's investing in. And so there's all the, they're getting pulled in all these different directions instead of going really back to the core of what problem do I want to solve?

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, my kind of theory and one of the challenges Web3 has had is that, you know, in the first phase of Web3, really we're just trying to solve technical problems, right. Like make it work at all. And the people who did those things kind of succeeded to ascend, and then. But those people that can solve those super hard technical problems are not the kind of UX people that can think, oh, from a user perspective, really. Right. They're thinking more about, okay, how do we solve that technical problem? And that's really where I think the shift has happened. And you, I think you've caught it at the right time.

SPEAKER_03: I think there's a lot more engineers these days too that are more savvy in that way, like towards design, like more like hybrid engineers who have that back-end, front-end—I mean just full stack, right. Who then are now also intrigued in design and this because maybe they built their own thing from scratch and they were forced to. Right. As opposed to just like a straight-up backend engineer who's doing these things.

SPEAKER_02: One thing I'll say, I now code again occasionally because the AI has gotten so good and if it has a template, it's not so good at UX from scratch. But if it has something to work from, I'm like no, just generate a component like this and do this and it usually gets it right within a couple times. So the iteration cycle is so much less painful than it used to be.

SPEAKER_03: Absolutely.

SPEAKER_00: And I found with my Web2 startups and my mobile startups that like one of the reasons I was CTO of the first startups and then I switched to product because I realized that hey, by turning step three into step one, I could 10x the usage overnight. But it's a totally different mode of thinking than how am I going to get the code out the door and get all of those things.

SPEAKER_03: Also, the infrastructure really didn't exist for a while. I remember vividly one time we were at the BlockApps office and Vic, you said in the office like mobile Web3 sucks. Just, just. I just, I don't even remember the day, I just remember you going on about it and it was true for such a long period of time is that the infrastructure needed to basically bring Web3 to mobile didn't exist for the longest time. And this last bear cycle of crypto, a lot of VC funding went to infrastructure. It's still not good enough. But that's fine, it's always improving. But the fact that a lot of infrastructure now exists that didn't exist back then or even just libraries, right. Of people having SDKs that are compatible with React Native or just native mobile languages to make it easier for developers to just take that and go and build and integrate. Because we need that. We can't build everything from scratch. Dude. As much as I would love to have everything in-house, especially being a mostly bootstrapped company is like no, we need people to have proper. They need to have good docs, good SDKs, good APIs, like hardened stuff that we can just take and use and that we don't have to like bash our heads against the wall trying to integrate it because it doesn't work.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I kind of remember that conversation. I think one of my frustrations at the time was like talking to some of the Ethereum devs and they were like yeah, we have a mobile solution. We're going to run a node on your phone. It was like do you know like battery life is important to me. I can last the day.

SPEAKER_01: This is where I started.

SPEAKER_00: Remember you tried to run it on a Watchman 2050 smartwatch.

SPEAKER_01: That was my first project was seeing if I could get C++ Ethereum running on a smartwatch and I didn't get that, but GE worked. GE worked on a smartwatch and it was because it was so early, right. That the chain was quite small. It was kind of just about workable. And now, I thought at the time, well you know, yeah we're going to have like this stuff. It'll just run inside like every router. It will just be like an OS-level sort of service.

SPEAKER_03: Right.

SPEAKER_01: We missed, you know, Mist had an embedded... Yeah it was just a thought that yeah, you know it might be a bit slow but you know we'll optimize it. Get 10x, it'll get 100x.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Never built a mobile app before.

SPEAKER_01: Obviously you're going to have like this stuff. It'll just run inside like every router. It will just be like an OS-level sort of service.

SPEAKER_03: Dude, building a mobile app sucks. It's hard. It's really hard. Especially.

SPEAKER_00: That's like a nightmare.

SPEAKER_03: I think that was the easy part. Dude, it's like that's hard but that was the easy part. It's like building a Web3 app that's multi-chain on multiple operating systems is just the amount of edge cases that exist is a nightmare. That's like been the hardest part. Like our last, we launched in June or like May, June. And then literally all summer was us just like hardening the app and discovering and smoothing over edge cases.

SPEAKER_01: And I see you've just launched on Android as well. Congratulations.

SPEAKER_03: Thank you. Publicly at least. You know we've been, we've been; I'm a big soft launch guy if you can. We're always probably soft releasing something ahead of time if you dig hard enough. But yeah, so Android took a while, like months longer than Apple because it's much easier to develop on Apple. Right. It's like everything's standardized, everything just works across every single device. On Android, it's like, okay, you have to worry about optimizations going back far enough to Android 12 to cover 90% of use cases. 10% of the world still runs on Android 11 and below, which is almost absurd. And then if you're doing that, you also have to worry about hardware optimizations to make sure that the app itself is lightweight enough to work on very base level Android devices because they cost very low and most of the world has a lot of these just like really cheap devices. Okay. So you can't load the app so much. It has to be optimized for that. And then the amount of different screen types and getting the edge-to-edge display to work via React Native Expo was also not working very well. And so a lot of people that launch apps on different devices, right, they maybe don't use React Native Expo, maybe they have native to each device. And so there's not even like good libraries that help on Expo for this. Expo just launched edge-to-edge display like two months ago. These things still aren't very public. And so my CTO even wants to launch a library like a publicly available repo, just to help with all of these hardships that we had to go through firsthand. Essentially. Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: I remember in my last company, it was a mobile company to make sure things ran on iOS, we ran it on two devices. In the simulator, we had a table of Android devices and just to kind of test all the configurations, there's probably.

SPEAKER_01: I don't know, 10,000, more than 10,000 different.

SPEAKER_00: I got a couple over here too. But TVs and tablets and whatever, right. They're all different and they're all different. I'm really curious, you know, when you made that evolution to a founder, as you were talking about before, what was the biggest challenge that you faced, do you think?

SPEAKER_03: The biggest challenge, it evolves over time, right. Like, as I level up as a founder, the challenges get bigger in a way. I think in the early days, one, it was getting people to align with my vision. It's like I have this vision in my head and I can talk about it, but then there's always a disconnect from what someone else's interpretation of my vision is versus what I have in my head. And so that's why I learned UX/UI design was so I can like literally just put it into a Figma and show someone and be like, this is what I want, right. Like, this is how I foresee it. And so that was the first challenge. And then I got my CTO on board because he's like, I love this idea, let's do it. Then we did that. And then the next challenge was the architecture, right. And so then the architectural solution of vendor selection, which I was talking to someone early today about this; vendor selection's a nightmare. Like I luckily already knew what chain I wanted to work on and, like, how I wanted to be multi-chain. So that was good. And then it's like, okay, so now to be like a robust multi-chain application, this is pretty cutting edge technology, especially if I want to use like account abstraction and smart accounts. Like very few people are sort of working on this, especially in the mobile era. And so like the infrastructure available to us at the time was fairly limited. And then it's like, okay, we have to worry about like key storage and how do we do recovery and how do we keep people safe. And like these are all the different vendors. Like for all, every different, there's a different decision for a different vendor and at each part of the stack, and being able to basically understand Web3 deep enough to understand the trade-offs of each different vendor and what they bring and okay, well what's the price? Because we're unfunded, right. So I have to make sure it works within my realm of my budget while also being able to make sure it's like scalable in the long term. If we do go into this. And then how do we do things? Do we do things to be modular, do we do things to go like purely vertical stack? Does that lock us in as a vendor? Do we want to be more modular? And then we've had opportunity, we've had moments where we've had to just rip vendors out of our stack because they're not performant enough, they're not elite enough, you know, and so by removing them and upgrading whatever we had, which sets us back in delivery time, right. So which took us a lot longer to build this stuff, especially as a, literally a two person team for the longest time. We just hired our second full-time engineer last month, but like it's just been me and my CTO for the longest time and like, thank God that I understand blockchain architecture as deeply as I do or my CTO would have had all of this would have been on him and it made it much easier being able to share that experience.

SPEAKER_00: That's awesome. But yeah, it's, as you say, every step there's a new challenge. But you know, I think it's also like just kind of being excited like you work really, really hard, as we can see. So, I think it's really exciting to hear about where you've gotten to with this project and just in general.

SPEAKER_03: Thank you.

SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, I'm just looking at the time, Brian. So let me just ask you one last question. Perhaps when are we ready for the normies?

SPEAKER_03: We're already ready for the normies. At least Pistachio is. We made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy. You don't have to worry about seed phrases, you don't have to worry about even having your phone stolen, right. Like we can recover everything in programmatic ways, in secure ways as well. That's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. But at least the next wave of updates that we're going to be doing is going to be really cool too, I think. Like it's just like the ability to essentially... The alpha is like the ability to send bank transfers from an on-chain account like to specific chain accounts all over the world for very, very cheap. So like stuff like that is going to be really cool because that solves real pain, right. It's like this idea of going back to before of literally what I've been talking about like crypto and even to tie it all in for the... Is better Web3 UX the key to mainstream adoption? And I don't think it is, right. It's like better UX is the key to any app adoption, right. It's why we've seen Robinhood or whatever get big. But there needs to be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day. And if our ability, if my ability to send an on-chain transaction and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or a SPEI transfer from the US to Mexico for only a dollar, like that's significant pain being solved because like most common applications right now that do it are let's say like DolarApp or Felix and they do it for like a $3 flat fee which is still pretty expensive for considering if you want to send money to someone. If you only want to send in small amounts, right. It's like $100. That's a 3% fee. That's quite high. And so we can basically do it in a way with like no limits, no caps, you can send $50,000 for a dollar if you want to do it like with banking rails or if you want to just keep it on-chain and keep it in Pistachio, right. It's free, unlimited as we all know how. You can send money in Crypto-land, right. You can send a million dollars in a second for only a few cents. And on Pistachio all the peer-to-peer transactions are free so I think we're ready for normies right now but it's just about increasing the amount of use cases within the app to solve very distinct, painful, expensive pains. That's the way to do it.
