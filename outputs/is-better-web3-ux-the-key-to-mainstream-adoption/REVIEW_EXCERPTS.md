> Yeah, sure. So, Brian Smokovich B Smokes eth on on Twitter. We're building Pistachio Fi. It's a. It's a mobile first neo bank a a built entirely on crypto Rails meant to provide premium savings with premium security and the whole concept of better ux. Right. Like, I will get to the question in the moment of does is UX the key to mainstream adoption? But I wanted to really just build something that, you know, I think. I think self custody is really important to me and I think really important to a lot of people about why we originally got into the space. But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible. Right. And so I just want. I wanted to. To be at the change that I wanted to see in the world and so decided to just say screw it. Built my own, basically taught myself UI design in order to begin this in the beginning and then built it literally by willing Pistachio into existence and many, many, many, many, many iterations of building the app. And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed that we've been publicly recognized by many Ethereum talking heads in. In the sense of being recognized for our UX and what we've been designing and doing and building and doing things in a way to just bring more. More people on chain.

But it's a totally different mode of thinking than how am I going to get the code out the door and get all of those things.

Go ahead, Bob. So hello, everybody. I guess we're ready to go. So today we have a special guest with us. It's the first time that you and I have met, Brian, but you are very familiar to all of my colleagues here as an ex-BlockApser. Yeah. You're never an ex-BlockApser. You're always like part of Team BlockApser. The alumni network. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

**Intermediate:**

> made you feel like okay this is something i can take well i've always honestly really loved the product side like i think i had like a natural ability to be a salesperson um like i love to just chat and create rapport and i think that's very important for sales and marketing But at the end of the day, I really just had a knack for, I think it was more of like just a natural inclination to this sort of thing. And then once I realized it and I started to do it, it's one of those, it's like the natural calling, right? Like when you find something that you really like, You don't really know that you really like it until you're doing it and knee deep in it. And then now suddenly I'm spending 12 to 15 hour days, uh, working a website or whatever it is. Right. Just because I'm like, I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve it. Um, so like when I was learning UX UI, it was, I, it was like some courses that I would take and do that. And then a lot of it was just trial and error. And I think a big part of it was having my own thing and I'm sure Kieran can I think all of you, both you guys can relate to this, is that once it's yours, there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it rather than just working for someone. When you work for someone, it's like, oh, okay, I get equity options and this and a paycheck, and that's nice. That's not as much skin in the game as truly... owning something and having being like aligned of like okay if i kill this like i get monetarily incentivized just because i killed it and it's my baby right um so i think that sort of shines a lot in in in being like a founder and growing your own application and then it's just like i have like an obsession with it to be honest like i have an obsession of talking to users and understand what makes it better. And just like the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth it over. Right. And so I think all of that has just like aggregated to and led me to where I am today. And yeah, I mean, one of the benefits of being in the space so long as we've gotten the chance to work with some great people and we could always see that you had that sort of entrepreneurial spirit. It's interesting that it's come out in

**Intermediate:**

> More like hybrid engineers who have that back end front, I mean, just full stack, right? Who then are now also intrigued in design and this because maybe they built their own thing from scratch and they were forced to, right? As opposed to just like a straight up back end engineer who's doing these things.

> project was seeing if I could get CPP Ethereum running on a smartwatch. And I didn't that, but Geth worked. Geth worked on a smartwatch because it was so early, right, that the chain was quite small. It was kind of just about workable. And there was a thought at the time, well, yeah, we're going to have like a light client thing. There isn't yet, but we'll get that going. And same with on the desktop, right? With Mist, you know, Mist had an embedded, you know, it was just a thought that, yeah, you know, it might be a bit slow, but, you know, we'll optimize it. It'll get 10x, it'll get 100x.

**Intermediate:**

> We're already ready for the normies. At least Pistachio is, right? We made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy. You don't have to worry about seed phrases. You don't have to worry about even having your phone stolen, right? Like we can recover everything in, programmatic ways and secure ways as well. That's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. And so, but at least the next wave of updates that we're gonna be doing is gonna be really cool too. I think like, it's just like the ability to, essentially the alpha is like the ability to send bank transfers from an on-chain account, like to specific accounts all over the world for very, very cheap. Um, so like stuff like that is going to be really cool because that solves real pain, right? It's like this idea of going back to before literally what I've been talking about, um, like crypto and even to tie it all in for the is better web three UX, the key to mainstream adoption. And I don't think it is right. It's like better UX is the key to any app adoption, right? It's why we've seen Robin hood or whatever get big, but there needs to be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day. And if our ability, if my ability to send an on-chain transaction, and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or a spay transfer from the US to Mexico for only a dollar, like that's significant pain being solved because like most common applications right now that do it are let's say like Dollar App or Felix, and they do it for like a $3 flat fee, which is still pretty expensive for considering if you want to send money to someone, if you only wanna send it in small amounts, right? a hundred dollars that's a three percent fee that's quite high and so we can basically do it in a way with like no limits no caps you can send fifty thousand dollars for for a dollar if you want to do it like with banking rails or if you want to just keep it on chain and keep it in pistachio right it's it's free unlimited as we all know how you can like send money and in in crypto land right you can send a million dollars in a second for for only a few cents and on pistachio every all the peer to peer transactions are free so i think we're ready for normies right now but it's just about increasing the amount of um increasing the use cases within the app to solve very distinct pains. Painful, expensive pains. That's the way to do it. Okay. Well, thank you very much. Thank you guys for having me. Yeah. I know you got to run. At least some of us will be at some of the international events. Maybe we can catch up there. Yeah, perfect. Please, if you guys are going to eat for that time in Brazil or DevConnect, I'll be at both of them. We will definitely be there. Look forward to seeing you in person, man. And I want to see your talk. Share us details about your talk, man. Yeah, absolutely. Will do. Take care. Okay. Thanks so much. Thanks. It was great to meet you, Bob. You too. Cheers. Bye-bye.
