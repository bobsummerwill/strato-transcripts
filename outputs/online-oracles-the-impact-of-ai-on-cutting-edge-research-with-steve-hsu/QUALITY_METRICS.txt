QUALITY ASSESSMENT: ONLINE ORACLES THE IMPACT OF AI ON CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH WITH STEVE HSU
================================================================================
Episode: online-oracles-the-impact-of-ai-on-cutting-edge-research-with-steve-hsu
Generated: January 08, 2026

Supported Combinations: 8 (found) / 8 (expected: 2 transcribers × 4 post-processors)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

IMPORTANT PIPELINE NOTE:
  Post-processing should run on the intermediate *.md transcripts (not *.txt)
  so post-processors can preserve the original timestamps.

KEY FINDINGS:

1) WORD-COUNT RETENTION: 8/8 outputs are within 90–110% of baseline
2) TIMESTAMP PRESERVATION: 1/8 outputs have an exact timestamp count match

RECOMMENDED FOR THIS EPISODE:
  • assemblyai + opus
      - timestamps: 71/71
      - retention:  99.5%

================================================================================
INPUT (INTERMEDIATE) TRANSCRIPTS
================================================================================

Word counts (baseline for retention; computed from the intermediate .md
transcripts with timestamps stripped):
  • online-oracles-the-impact-of-ai-on-cutting-edge-research-with-steve-hsu_assemblyai.md  6,777 words
  • online-oracles-the-impact-of-ai-on-cutting-edge-research-with-steve-hsu_whisperx-cloud.md  6,679 words

Timestamp/header counts in intermediate .md (GROUND TRUTH timing):
  • online-oracles-the-impact-of-ai-on-cutting-edge-research-with-steve-hsu_assemblyai.md   71 timestamps (71 timestamped headers)
  • online-oracles-the-impact-of-ai-on-cutting-edge-research-with-steve-hsu_whisperx-cloud.md   27 timestamps (27 timestamped headers)

OUTPUT (POST-PROCESSED) WORD COUNT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Legend:
  retention = output_words / input_words
  timestamps = output timestamp count / input timestamp count

================================================================================
QUALITY FLAGS / REVIEW NOTES
================================================================================

1) Timestamp count changes are the primary red flag
   Any output with far more timestamps than the input is not preserving the
   diarization paragraphing and is likely regenerating timestamps.

RECOMMENDATION:
  • Use intermediate .md files as the canonical timestamped transcript.
  • Use post-processed .txt outputs for corrected wording / readability.

PROJECT IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS (TO REDUCE MANUAL EDITING)
================================================================================

1) Deterministic timestamp preservation (recommended architecture)
   Do NOT ask the model to 'preserve timestamps' in free-form text.
   Instead: parse -> correct text only -> reassemble with original timestamps.

2) Entity constraints + validation
   Reject outputs that introduce new PERSON entities not present in input/allowlist.

3) Validation + auto-retry
   Enforce exact timestamp sequence match, non-decreasing timestamps, and header format.
