SPEAKER_00: Okay. Hello, hello. We are live. Welcome to Online Oracles. I am Bob Summerwill. I’d like to welcome the rest of our guests here today. So we have Michael Tan, Victor Wong, Kieran James Lubin, and also making an appearance is Jeff Powell. Jeff, would you like to introduce yourself?

SPEAKER_01: Thanks, Bob. I’m Jeff Powell, head of business development at Black Apps. I’ve been working with people on this video for close to five years now. In recent years, I’ve done a great deal of work on our tokenized metals campaigns. So I’m very excited to be here today to talk about silver.

SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it seems, I mean, maybe a little bit.

SPEAKER_01: And gold.

SPEAKER_00: That’s it. You’re absolutely perfect for the topic today. So yeah, our topic today is silver’s all-time high. What’s going on? But we’ve also got gold at all-time highs happening after that. Before we get into those, we’re going to have a little demo or conversation from Michael. What have you got for us?

SPEAKER_03: Sure.

SPEAKER_04: So I’m going to be demoing the Strato Easy Save bridging process. Right now, we have a bridging contest going on where if you bridge in a certain amount, 10% of that goes to a pool that will be distributed to the winner through a lucky draw. Points are generated and calculated through the Strato rewards program. So everyone has a chance to win—you’ve got to be in it to win it. This is the current leaderboard on Stratoscan if you want to check it out. But now, I’ll demo the Easy Save. Once you log in to your account, go to the deposit button. Connect your wallet.

SPEAKER_03: To be clear, this is on the Testnet, but the process on the production network is exactly the same.

SPEAKER_00: Yep.

SPEAKER_04: You can bridge in either USDT or USDC. Let’s do USDT for this one—let’s say 100. Make sure this is checked so that it goes directly to the lending pool. Pause and earn.

SPEAKER_00: Confirm.

SPEAKER_03: Confirm.

SPEAKER_04: It takes a second.

SPEAKER_02: The bridge is on the Ethereum side.

SPEAKER_04: Olia side bridge did go into auto save, and there you have it. In one to two minutes, it’ll be directly in the lending pool. If you want to check it out, you can go to the advanced lending pool, and your funds will be in here. Okay, back over to you, Bob.

SPEAKER_00: Very nice. Well, thank you, Kieran or Victor. Anything you’d like to say about that?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we wanted to have a very convenient way. Some users out there in the world just want simple, pretty good yields—better than you typically get from a savings account—without too much thinking. So Easy Savings, while you need a crypto-native wallet for now, from there, it’s essentially one click. As you saw, you can get around a 4% yield, depending on the circumstances. It’s different on the Testnet than the live network. We’re happy to make it still DeFi-native but as consumer-friendly as possible.

SPEAKER_00: There we go.

SPEAKER_03: Thanks, Michael. Take care.

SPEAKER_04: Yep.

SPEAKER_00: So, Jeff, tell us about 47th Street. I always hear about 47th Street from you. What’s going on there?

SPEAKER_01: Well, when we talk about 47th Street, we’re talking about 47th Street in Manhattan, known as the Diamond District. It’s filled with stores buying and selling diamonds and other precious stones. But it’s also an epicenter for buying and selling precious metals—specifically gold and silver. As Black Apps started tokenizing metals, we established relationships with various dealers and vaulters. But 47th Street became a prime source for us to learn about the business. While people may not think of it as a place with a lot of value other than stones, there’s a lot of business and vaulting happening there. There are very large supplies of gold and silver there. We’ve developed helpful partnerships to navigate the space and successfully move into the tokenization business for gold and silver. That’s been an important part of our Strato platform.

SPEAKER_00: Well, good to have those connections. So what’s happening with the price of precious metals right now?

SPEAKER_01: Well, before we get into that, maybe we could talk a little bit about why we got into precious metals in the first place.

SPEAKER_00: Please do.

SPEAKER_01: And Kieran, I’m going to flip that to you for a second.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay. I’ll share an anecdote. So in 2020, around March, we were fleeing our office because of COVID-19. At the time, I realized we were going to print a lot of money, so I thought, what should I get into to hedge against the expanding money supply? I got out of anything related to lending and got into more crypto, which I’ve always been in. I also bought ETFs like GLD or IAU, but they didn’t do much for two years. Meanwhile, everything risk-on went crazy. Zoom went up 10x. I did buy a little Zoom because I thought we’d be video conferencing more, but I didn’t buy enough. Crypto, like ETH, went from 80 to where it is now, which was good. The metals did nothing for a couple of years, and I exited flat. Crypto people tend to be hard money-oriented, and crypto is better than precious metals in many ways. But I felt metals are the boomer version of crypto. Although that might be changing now, with younger people getting into silver futures. So the call was to tokenize metals, and by accident, we found a lot of demand for them.

SPEAKER_03: Well, I think there was one other thing we talked about at the time: crypto was seen as a store of value and a hedge against world events, but it moved more in line with the stock market, while metals acted more like a true hedge. So metals provided that opportunity.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think both of those are really interesting. And Kieran, since you went back in time a few years, something else that I think boosted the popularity of metals among investors was Costco’s decision in September 2023 to start selling gold bars. They sold them at very low margins—1% to 2% above spot. If you were a Costco VIP member or used their credit card, you could get a discount, effectively buying gold at spot price. It was a loss leader for Costco, but it’s estimated they’ve been selling $100-200 million of gold bars monthly since then. That really opened people up to the idea of alternative assets.

SPEAKER_00: Without having to go to a bullion dealer.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly. You could buy your groceries and pick up a gold bar on the way out.

SPEAKER_00: As you do.

SPEAKER_01: As one does in America.

SPEAKER_00: Dollar-cost averaging—add a bit of silver to your groceries.

SPEAKER_02: Are there bullets next to the gold? Some garlic for the vampire?

SPEAKER_03: Also, the highest level of Costco membership gives cash back, so there’s an ARB opportunity there.

SPEAKER_01: Kieran will be running to Costco after this.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly.

SPEAKER_01: Didn’t realize he was missing out on the arb.

SPEAKER_03: Get an SUV, max out his Costco membership, really live it up.

SPEAKER_01: But moving forward into the last year, it’s really exploded—both gold and silver. A year ago, silver was around $30 an ounce; now it’s $112. Gold has basically doubled. We’ve talked about hedging against inflation, fiscal concerns, and global instability. But Kieran, do you think those are the factors driving it?

SPEAKER_02: Well, it’s usually more than one thing. I believe central banks started deleveraging from the dollar due to global instability. They’ve been selling treasuries and buying gold and silver. This has created a lot of demand. The Russia sanctions, for example, made nations rethink their trust in the dollar. Countries like India and China are dumping treasuries and buying metals. Central banks are stockpiling silver, and this cycle started with aggressive sanctions and the Russia case. The world is realigning, becoming multipolar, and losing trust in the dollar.

SPEAKER_04: Right.

SPEAKER_02: And the new administration’s negotiating style has long-run effects. The world doesn’t trust the dollar as much anymore. Silver is higher beta than gold—it’s more volatile. There’s an Ethereum-Bitcoin analogy: Bitcoin is like gold, sitting there, while silver is used industrially in semiconductors, solar panels, and more. The price of silver is so high it could mess with commerce, but mining will correct it eventually.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: And that’s part of it. Silver’s price is so high it’s hard to substitute industrially. Mining will ramp up, and the price will adjust.

SPEAKER_00: But mining takes a while to turn around.

SPEAKER_02: It does take some time, but the price should correct quickly once the capital is there.

SPEAKER_01: So institutions started seeing treasuries as less of a safe haven and turned to precious metals?

SPEAKER_02: Yes. In inflationary times, commodities do well. Holding gold and silver is better than holding dollars if the dollar isn’t acting like a fungible bearer asset.

SPEAKER_01: Is it a lack of confidence in the dollar or just diversification?

SPEAKER_02: It’s a sober evaluation. The U.S. will continue printing money. Federal spending is up 30%-40% from 2020. It’s getting harder to borrow, so taxes or printing will likely increase. The dollar’s value as a savings asset is diminishing, though it’s still a medium of exchange. Some nations want to kneecap the U.S. a bit.

SPEAKER_02: Still, most trade happens for convenience, but savings value is shifting. Holding gold, silver, or other assets is a good idea in this environment.

SPEAKER_03: I think industrial use cases are driving silver prices. China dominates solar panel and EV production, and they’re actively searching for new markets. Silver hit all-time highs on the Shanghai exchange, and China implemented export controls in January, signaling it’s a strategic asset. They might be stockpiling silver like they did Nvidia chips.

SPEAKER_00: That’s an interesting change.

SPEAKER_02: Minister of the Chinese Strategic Civil Reserve.

SPEAKER_00: No inside knowledge.

SPEAKER_01: No inside info.

SPEAKER_03: Just speculation based on their behavior.

SPEAKER_00: Thinking back to my earlier experience as a gold and silver bug, I was aware of Bitcoin but wasn’t interested because I knew how terrible software was. I did well with silver from 2009-2011 until I leveraged myself during the spike and ended up in debt. Don’t use leverage, kids.

SPEAKER_03: And none of this is investment advice.

SPEAKER_00: Especially not with leverage on volatile assets. The narratives are similar now, but industrial use has ramped up a lot over the last 10-15 years.

SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah. Canada just announced they’ll be importing Chinese EVs. Silver’s industrial uses have grown significantly. There’s a rebalancing happening between gold and silver.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, people in the silver business feel the same way. Even at $70 an ounce in 2025, people said it was overpriced, and it’s done nothing but go up since then.

SPEAKER_03: Jeff, it’s not easy to exit silver at a good price, right?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, big companies are overwhelmed with sellers. Minimums have increased to $10,000-$20,000, and it takes longer to complete deals. Rates are nowhere near spot price.

SPEAKER_02: They’re short, too.

SPEAKER_01: Right. They’re short on everything, including willingness to pay close to spot price.

SPEAKER_03: This shows why tokenized silver is better. Our tokenized silver trades close to spot.

SPEAKER_01: Tokenized metals are instant settlement instruments, like crypto.

SPEAKER_02: Paulo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, suggested governments might issue gold-backed stablecoins to compete with the dollar. Tether tokenizes billions in gold.

SPEAKER_03: They’re trying to bring back the gold standard.

SPEAKER_01: There we go.

SPEAKER_02: Yes.

SPEAKER_00: Make Ron Paul happy.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly. I think we’re at time. Any closing thoughts?

SPEAKER_02: As a crypto person, I’d say we love all assets. They’re anti-correlated, so having both tokenized metals and crypto is probably better than just one.

SPEAKER_03: Not investment advice.

SPEAKER_02: And yeah, it’s wild times. We have some corporate gold and silver. It’s bittersweet—the prices are saying something bad about the world.

SPEAKER_03: It’s a bet that the world will be unstable going forward.

SPEAKER_00: Not a hard bet.

SPEAKER_03: Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: No. So, quickly, tomorrow I’m doing a Spaces with F Denver to talk about the Museum of Ethereum exhibit I’ve been working on with Jessica Angel, the creative director there. It’s a mixture of physical and digital artifacts, including the Ethereum Time Machine. Strato is supporting this.

SPEAKER_03: Kieran, when you started the Early Days of Ethereum series, did you ever think it would become physical?

SPEAKER_02: No, but it merits a museum. We need to preserve the artifacts, cast them in metals.

SPEAKER_03: Bronze statues of Vitalik somewhere.

SPEAKER_00: AI has been helpful for recovering details. It’s like archaeological work.

SPEAKER_03: In the crypto world, 10 years is like several lifetimes.

SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.

SPEAKER_03: Okay, thank you, everyone. Take care.

SPEAKER_02: Have a good one.

SPEAKER_01: Bye.

SPEAKER_02: Bye.

SPEAKER_00: Bye.
