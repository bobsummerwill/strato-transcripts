**[00:01] SPEAKER_03:** so hello and uh welcome to f denver 2026 so here recording for early days of ethereum uh with zolt felfeldy how do you pronounce your name jolt jolt there you go anyway so yeah i was working out when we we were recently you know reconnected at devconnect and i was working out that you're the third longest person at the ethereum foundation right that you've got vitalik and then uh and then felix and then you yeah i haven't uh really checked this fact yet but uh honestly yeah it sounds great that's it so i mean you're a very long time uh you know member of the geth team yes but what were you doing before you started at the foundation what was your your background how did you find your way into into the blockchain world

**[00:34] SPEAKER_01:** well uh before so before ethereum uh i was uh working on really different uh types of projects so um uh i i start first started uh at a hungarian software company like really classic software company we actually sold softwares in boxes like like in a put on a shelf discs like yeah like floppy disks uh put in a box on a shelf and you can buy the software so like like this type uh like classic classic uh software five and a quarter inch floppies yeah yeah actually three and a half was oh okay three and a half we're on to modern floppies yeah but maybe also like like in i said in 97 so maybe i was exaggerating a little so by that time it was mostly mostly cds we still used a lot of floppies anyway so uh those uh so uh at uh that company i did uh uh things related to uh first did related things related to computer graphics like uh i brought a ray tracing engine for some architectural software and then i also did a lot of work on electronic circuit simulation and circuit design right so yeah really different things and uh it was around 2011 when i first heard about bitcoin right and around 2012 when i started to realize that uh as weird as it sounds it uh it really is probably a big thing and um yeah so uh actually i first heard about ethereum uh early 2014 a few months after the initial paper has been published yeah and uh yeah started contributing i think around november and uh officially joined ef at in uh 2015 march so yeah and did you hear about it you think through like um through danny and victor or some other way

**[03:02] SPEAKER_03:** uh at in uh 2015 march so yeah and did you hear about it you think through like um through danny and

**[03:10] SPEAKER_01:** victor or some other way well uh i i uh i did did hear about it from like danny and victor's friend circle so right yeah but uh then victor was already actually actually i never i didn't know victor before so i i met heard about this thing through one of them his friends and then then victor was also in that wider circle and he came to hungary and said oh i'm already working on this and then i i started with my ideas and started to explain to him why this thing probably will never work and and and he was like okay you seem to have a good understanding of this why don't you come to work

**[03:52] SPEAKER_03:** right right right so yeah and was i'm right in thinking that you said it was swarm that you started with

**[03:59] SPEAKER_01:** with well yeah so um so swarm was uh like part of this uh initial like the trinity of base technologies of ethereum so it was supposed to be the storage layer for for for dApps yeah i mean it was kind of a naive uh uh uh way of of of of like how people imagine the decentralized applications back there but but honestly it made sense at the time so i'm i i i i will say that that uh yeah never nothing ever turned out exactly the way that people imagined it but we are still making a lot of progress so yeah swarm was how uh we initially imagined uh like the the storage layer for ethereum and i mean this this project still has merits uh but yeah this whole problem space is just a bit more complex yeah yeah so i started contributing to uh swarm first and actually i brought the first like 500 lines

**[05:02] SPEAKER_03:** of swarm there you go yeah i mean i i think if i remember rightly that victor mentioned around may 2014 was when he first heard you know that the trinity that this this concept that you could have you know ethereum as your sort of your compute an expensive database swarm as your decentralized storage and then whisper as your messaging there's that famous diagram right with the there's like a circle and the things coming in and whisper going around the edge and there's another one of those um but uh uh but yeah i mean i guess it was devcon zero where danny really presented a a sort of a fleshed out vision of uh of what that decentralized storage

**[05:51] SPEAKER_01:** uh of what that decentralized storage yes that's correct uh i wasn't there at devcon zero yet so i've heard about this idea even before i heard about ethereum so with danny already told me about this idea that he wants to do this kind of uh hash based chunk storage yeah and uh yeah it's uh so it made total sense that uh he just pitched that that can fit in yeah yeah it at the time it it it was a perfect fit yeah um so so he pitched uh this idea uh at devcon zero and when uh when they accepted it and hired danny then danny called me and said because he already knew that i know of this project and yeah then let's do it together so there you go and then so you were hired

**[06:40] SPEAKER_03:** into into fdev um yes i did have a date for that i've forgotten i guess it was shortly after shortly after devcon zero right that you that you started there yes correct did you go to berlin or amsterdam well when did you first meet other people how did it was uh amsterdam in uh in february 15 right uh that's where i met uh jeffrey wilker the creator of goiterium and the the the goiterium team back then i don't say get because that get was was was like this abbreviation was uh invented later but so so yeah that's where i met the goiterium people yeah and uh i i already like had these contributions to swarm and it was like kind of a an implied thing that maybe i might be hired but but but there was really no official hiring process back then right so yeah it was really just um uh jeff was this really laid back guy and he just he just said okay okay man i saw your contributions and let's talk some uh sometime this week and uh yeah i waited the whole week and waited for some some serious interview like like it's it was a dream job for me yeah like but by that time i sorry i i i was really enthusiastic about this whole thing and i felt like even so even though i felt that uh this whole initial design was uh yeah i i i couldn't really couldn't imagine how it was scale and everything and yeah it is a hard problem so yeah it was true but it was still worth starting it and uh and and and i was really enthusiastic and i really wanted to get hired and uh yeah the whole week i just waited and at the end of the week like the last half an hour before we all left home jeff just said oh yeah when i wanted to talk to you you're hired okay that's a good

**[08:47] SPEAKER_03:** talk so yeah this is how the hiring process went back then excellent well that's that's easy we like that and uh so you that that was that was before you went to amsterdam i assume i assume you went to amsterdam after you had been hired no no no it happened in amsterdam oh you so i see so you were there

**[09:07] SPEAKER_01:** uh unhired on site yeah so uh so uh so i like like jeff agreed that if i mean i i bought my own plane ticket but i could stay at the rbnb where the whole team stayed and uh yeah i just worked with them and showed my contributions and yeah so so i i i went to amsterdam unhired but uh yeah i mean right

**[09:29] SPEAKER_03:** right that plane ticket was a good investment so yeah um so did they not have office space at that point even well they did they actually back then there was an amsterdam office right uh it was mostly for jeff uh because jeff lived in amsterdam yeah but um uh when jeff left yeah or maybe before that i'm not sure exactly but so the the this office was closed and actually it was a really small office right uh last time i checked now i think it's a dentist uh like oh yeah works there yeah yeah it doesn't exist but it was really just a small small place but uh uh uh i later i i i i went to berlin a lot after i was hired and and and yeah it was it was for for for the get team it was really really it was centered in in somehow in in uh berlin so right right because yeah i mean i guess as well as jeff

**[10:27] SPEAKER_03:** you've got you've got you've got baz right i i i he he he he was another uh amsterdam person right bas bas bas van yeah um but then maybe most of the other team members weren't in berlin

**[10:41] SPEAKER_01:** sorry not in amsterdam i mean yeah yeah no one else was quite quite distributed bus was there for a short time relatively short time and jeffrey also uh left uh after a while yeah and started his own company

**[10:57] SPEAKER_03:** right develop games or something yeah so though he he did have oh f labs was another one do you know anything about f labs because when jeff worked with jp morgan to do quorum um that was announced under under the label f labs never heard of that yeah i think i heard the name

**[11:20] SPEAKER_01:** but i didn't really know uh what it does but yeah i i that this is something i knew that jeff started working with jp morgan yeah back then and then in in that time big banks really really wanted to to to to just talk to us at every defcon and right we were always invited to fancy dinners by some main people and yeah so so banks really wanted to learn about the technology yeah yeah so jeff jeff went went uh for a while to work on forum yes true yeah yeah i mean i i unless i can

**[11:56] SPEAKER_03:** somehow get in contact with jeff i i guess it's a little bit of a mystery what what exactly f labs was though i suspect it might be a little bit like um ethosphere of just sort of being a you know a name a banner for activities rather than a legal entity um and and another thing i don't know there but i suspect is i don't think jeff told ming that he was doing that stuff with jpm i suspect that he completely just did that on his own without any communication with ming or or with the ef it's just

**[12:34] SPEAKER_01:** well actually he never really told a lot to us about that so right we knew that yeah he's working with jp morgan but probably like it's a big bank probably he had to sign a contract on disclosure agreement so just he probably couldn't share all the details no no i mean i remember at some point and

**[12:54] SPEAKER_03:** i can't remember the context him saying he found it interesting because the consensus for that was on chain like this the the consensus for that was happening as smart contracts so it was kind of almost like this pluggable consensus but consensus pulled up you know into the app layer so he found that quite interesting that the the initial called quorum consensus it didn't last long but um but i think gav also was was doing that sort of stuff on the c plus plus side that he he did some proof of authority stuff uh before that happened on the geth side you know before clique um that the the was this okay well you can he actually made a different c plus plus client so you've got f but he made another one that was called like fluidity or something which was like pulling all the libraries in the same but it was with a proof of authority consensus but he did that was one of the last things he did before he went out to parity so i i think both him and jeff were you know interested at that thought of well how can you formulate these these pieces in in different ways right for those kind of uh use cases interesting but yeah he he he he he left um i think it was i think it was probably very early in 2017 i i did i did find a a period but it was certainly ahead of uh ahead of of devcon uh three let me see if i can find the date yeah uh i don't remember the exact date

**[14:44] SPEAKER_01:** and actually there was maybe there wasn't even a really exact date when jeff left no because uh so so so so uh basically a month after i joined uh peter slidey joined and uh and he he he was the team lead for a very long time so jeff basically uh yeah kind of handed it on to peter and for a while he was officially still team lead but not really we haven't seen him on the calls for

**[15:13] SPEAKER_03:** no so the date i found there was february 2017 but i i think i got that from github i think that was like his final commit but he probably tailed off yeah he's a long time yeah he already started focusing

**[15:29] SPEAKER_01:** on other stuff uh like this forum stuff and then his own things uh sometime in 16 so yeah yeah so

**[15:37] SPEAKER_03:** started a company called grid games with his brother just building building a particular game but that also seems to have ceased so yeah he's unknown off in the world somewhere yeah that's pretty

**[15:52] SPEAKER_01:** much all i know about him he we try to invite him a few times to just come to some event and and meet up and but yeah i think think of for some reasons he really had enough of maybe not us but uh but but

**[16:09] SPEAKER_03:** things going on in the ef and yeah i mean yeah i think that would be the case that you um you know when ming came in she both did legal tidy up but also cut the spending a lot you know that you'd had the crowd sale in july august september 2014 but coming up to the mainnet release a year later like nearly

**[16:36] SPEAKER_01:** all the money was gone yes they spent it very fast yeah so that uh defcom one was a postponed one because of that yeah so and uh and but we didn't really uh feel a lot of this actually uh jeff just said that uh that now that ether price is so low actually i think the lower point was uh 42 cents yeah and uh full year it didn't really move and jeff just said that okay uh we all have to take a payment card but the payment card was really just uh 10 percent and i think maybe he took a bigger one so yeah yeah for us it was really not that uh bad and uh and the the the idea was that when ether price uh reaches two dollars then yeah we do have some go back some some some time to some money to go forward so yeah then then our salaries went back so and that wasn't a lot of time so yeah actually uh for for for i think yeah this is i don't don't really remember the price history and maybe it's not the most important thing but uh but i think i think i think uh enterprise reached something like 10 dollars pretty soon like in 2016 the start of 2016 yeah and and we went even a little bit higher but then we had the dow fork and the the shanghai attacks and right and well uh given how how turbulent those times were the markets helped pretty well so so yeah yeah and with 10 enterprise we could survive further and yeah

**[18:18] SPEAKER_03:** yeah i mean that was quite a jump up i mean i i heard that at the worst point there was only four months of runway left you know that was how close it was to to running out of money um but yeah there were those big cuts which really you know resulted in like gav gavin the c plus plus team were the the main kind of like victims of those cuts um but then yeah just into 2016 pardon me so i was hired in february 2016 uh same time as um uh greg colvin came in and also uh uh pavel uh was rehired you know he he was working through imap uh you know working on that jit um but they that contract stopped but then then he came back at that time as well so it was this this period through late 2015 to early 20s 16 was like you know the absolute bottom of like are we even going to ship this thing are we going to run out of money before we get to mainnet um but then yeah some of us were really coming in as as backfill for for that for that c plus plus team yeah so i mean def defcon one was sort of you know you were mentioning in in that in that series that uh had had got cancelled uh but then consensus came in and actually like paid for that and said hey we'll we'll like mainly organize it and kind of uh so that the thing can happen um so that was the big you know the first public event so what what

**[19:55] SPEAKER_01:** what your what your memories of of defcon one well my my subjective impression was that it's really amazing yeah compared to today's defcons it was small i think three hundred something people maybe uh but uh i'm not sure about less than a thousand yeah and um and um yeah it was it was in a really really prestigious venue some some old bank building or thread needle seat yeah it's like city of london and and yeah i i really felt like okay so now this is this is really a serious thing and probably that was the reason why consensus stepped in and and funded the event so we really could step up in terms of like public appearance and appears something really serious and uh yeah i remember uh like all the big banks having the president like the booth at uh at defcon one right yeah so yeah and then microsoft

**[20:59] SPEAKER_03:** is headline sponsor it's like wow right like recognition right that you you you're like wow microsoft are interested and supportive and um yeah i mean i think for a lot of people it was a a real kind of wow like this is for real you know sadly i i i could not afford to go i i watched the live stream i uh was not i was not quite in and working yet i was a an enthusiastic uh contributor but uh yeah so

**[21:34] SPEAKER_01:** actually it was also like the first time for me when i met a larger number of ethereum people right yeah i i first met the go ethereum team in in like early 15 and yeah i went to amsterdam one more time i think in may but uh but uh defcon one was the place where i really uh like realized that how big this thing this thing is and and and it's really not just about like client developers but also like even even back then people presented about uh formal verification and all this stuff so yeah i i realized that it is this this is really big and probably everyone wants to be a part of it

**[22:20] SPEAKER_03:** at least a little bit yeah yeah yeah i mean looking back at devcon one videos it's like everything like any kind of use case you could think of you know there was somebody presenting about it you know this so so early more than 10 years ago but you know many many concepts uh which were probably like massively too early to do but maybe you can do them all now seem to be uh presented you had nick sabo as well nick sabo doing a a keynote yeah yeah yeah nick sabo was also there so was that maybe the first time that you'd met a number of the people in berlin like christoph jance and left

**[23:00] SPEAKER_01:** terrace and maybe even gav uh i think i met some of these people already in london and i think first time i went to berlin office uh back then it was like they need the other like it was like the old office yeah right but um so yeah some people i met at defcon one some people i met in berlin but yeah yeah so

**[23:24] SPEAKER_03:** no uh so was that was defcon one the first time that you'd been to to do ethereum things in london or did you did you go to any sort of london meetups or meet any of those comms people earlier

**[23:39] SPEAKER_01:** uh i didn't go to any meetups to london before but actually uh i i did so victor victor was uh was in london at the time and uh and i was uh i i went to london around the time actually if you're doing some some some uh uh event with with my old software company the hungarian software company oh right yeah so we we we we went to london to to like like like like like sell our software and everything so i was still working there right and after that yeah i met up with victor and talked about

**[24:23] SPEAKER_03:** things because yeah he um from what he was describing and then i was looking at videos and things later he uh had seen gav talk in london in very very early february i think it was february the 6th um so almost immediately after they'd had the miami like you know b2c miami launch uh you know vitalik's first public talk and uh and the you know anthony diorio's like mansion where they you know a lot of them met for the first time gav had been back in london i think it was like a week a week after uh and did a talk there that victor had gone to that was victor's first uh you know in-person meeting with any of these and uh and then uh you know gav had pulled him on board yeah so those are like

**[25:22] SPEAKER_01:** the very very early days i wasn't there so i when i first heard about ethereum that was uh i think march or april uh 14 so i first heard about the pre-sale and uh yeah like that's yeah that's that's that's where i first heard about this thing but yeah i know that uh gavin was like one of the very early founders of this and and he wrote the the uh yellow paper yeah full of greek letters yes

**[25:51] SPEAKER_03:** very confusing yeah and and the c plus plus client of course um so the the first time i think i saw your name or was in contact with you was was about light client uh because you know i'd i'd been trying to get ethereum uh arm linux cross builds running on my smartwatch um and my thought there was get the thing running and then this light client stuff is just kind of starting and you know like scaling will be solved right we're going to be able to like run these nodes on anything you know you'll have them on your phone uh smartwatch router they'll be in every operating system you know it's just we'll solve that that that that scaling and that lightness so you you were plunged right into that problem right

**[26:38] SPEAKER_01:** yeah so when jeff hired me actually uh he he he put me on this he has put me on this project so so he he just said that uh okay uh it's great that i contributed to swarm but i i i if if if i joined the get team i i will have to uh start working on that on the light client because it's a very important thing and it hasn't been started yet yeah so yeah i i felt really good about it like yeah i i i i i also felt like this is this is a big thing and yeah back then it really felt like uh we do these few things we have a working light client protocol and and and and and the the whole eternity of of like a base layer and then we're all good yeah but it wasn't that easy but still those were the first steps and uh so so i designed the les protocol yeah uh in retrospect it didn't make a lot of sense to uh design to to build it over the dev p2p layer right because yeah like it wasn't easy to access from web browsers and stuff but also also it was it was a proof of work based light client and right so yeah that that project ended after a while but uh i'm still uh very much into like uh trustless chain access so that's that has usually been one of my focuses all the time so right now i'm also working on on an uh something called the trustless execution real uh execution layer api right which uh is similar to the beacon beacon rest api uh but uh works on the execution layer and and and provides everything with proofs so yeah i i'm still very much into this because i think this is where it really makes sense if even normal users access thing access chain data with proofs

**[28:36] SPEAKER_03:** right right and there was a project called portal as well were you involved with portal that was a later

**[28:42] SPEAKER_01:** kind of like client no i wasn't uh so portal was a uh piper marion's brainchild and uh yeah so uh so by the time uh we kind of realized that uh les was a nice first experiment but maybe not the best approach uh he he started uh like something different that was a udp based and and and and also like use different topologies so it uh it was kind of a dhd uh approach to storing the chain and the state and yeah actually uh i'm kind of uh like i i i think it's it's it's a bad thing that uh it's been completely canceled because uh well actually to be honest i never really believed that uh that it will be a easily solvable problem to store the merkel petership try of the state right on the dhd but for the chain data yeah it made perfect sense so yeah uh maybe maybe the state would have been possible with a lot of work but yeah i mean piper told me a few times about how he imagines the order to solve all the uh unsolvable problems and i felt like yeah it sounds good but he just made a lot of uh really hard assumptions about dhd is that i by the time i i already worked on discovery v5 so there was also this discovery protocol that uh uh basically we designed it in uh 2016 in berlin with felix and uh i released the original version and um yeah so so i already knew that uh yeah it's it's never so easy to imagine like a dhd that's that's efficiently formed that all the nodes are working and yeah like this uh so but but for the for the for the chain data right especially uh with uh eip444 so like like uh that uh lets the main protocol the nodes processing main protocol uh forget the all chain history right so it it it made perfect sense to at least uh put the chain history on a dhd yeah but uh yeah so it was an ef decision that it was discontinued uh uh at points well i mean i guess the thing is

**[31:06] SPEAKER_03:** you know patricia merkle trees are not great for you know the number of accesses and things anyway let alone if you're making each of those steps over a networked you know uh dhd kind of setup that's yeah there's a lot of it's so much transactional change yeah complexity state three suffers from a

**[31:32] SPEAKER_01:** lot of issues especially in america patricia state three yeah and yeah it's it's it's it's a huge data set that uh keeps changing all the time and keeps changing it's completely random places yeah and it's it's it's not as easy it is task to distribute it right so actually it's uh it's it's getting harder to even synchronize it between the full most or in the entire state yeah yeah so yeah yeah

**[31:59] SPEAKER_03:** so um do you do you think that proofs are going to be a magic you know magic silver bullet here where uh by uh by by by having you know local proofs versus you know uh massive really redundant state machines do you think do you think there's a path here where oh oh yeah no it's not a silver bullet so

**[32:24] SPEAKER_01:** uh so uh i assume you mean what people call statelessness uh so it's it's a good thing it uh it it allows uh definitely allows a higher degree of scanning but the state tree still has to be processed and maintained by someone and especially if most of the most of the nodes have no incentive to to process it yeah and uh and it and yeah now we are talking about a hundred decks and thousand x scaling then uh then then even even if we also do uh state expiry which is currently imagined in a way that we basically reset the state tree every year or something and yeah and have multiple state trees so yeah that has somewhat but if we scale a thousand x then it will be a huge infrastructural centralization issue right and uh yeah by the way i i i i this this this thing is is is not an unsolvable problem i mean i mean the the the state as it works today yeah unfortunately somehow makes it really hard to do any fundamental improvements over these properties but uh people are considering uh uh like uh different storage architectures yeah of course we have to keep the existing contracts workable because that was our like main promise from the beginning right but we will not just shut down anything yeah everything has 100 uptime but uh it is so it is it is it is it is a viable way to uh come up with the more efficient storage methods and use it as an opt-in alternative that will over time be available for much less and new contracts can be designed using those more efficient uh storage

**[34:26] SPEAKER_03:** architectures yeah because vertical trees seem to be the first sort of thought on that but then those yeah that's kind of come and gone and maybe it's a binary tree or actually it does either

**[34:40] SPEAKER_01:** uh uh so important either i mean i mean i mean uh both are better than the merkel patricia tree yeah but uh in some ways but uh they don't solve this fundamental issue by themselves so still the thing is that the state is a permanent key value store uh and uh in order to uh avoid it growing forever uh yeah there's all these these ideas about uh state expiry but still it's it's it's it's it's it's it's going to be a huge data set and uh and the method of hashing or or like uh consensus represent protocol representation uh doesn't fundamentally change this so vertical uh was supposed to provide more efficient marker proofs but also i guess somewhat more expensive state processing because it's like more expensive cryptography right also uh if i'm correct it's not quantum secure so right right and that was also a thing that where i i always felt like yeah i'm not sure if it's a good idea to start working from now and i just saw it in front of my eyes how it's going to be cancelled and um yeah so yeah i mean uh i guess

**[36:04] SPEAKER_03:** for running nodes in general you know there's not a lot of incentive for people to run any kind of like node software themselves unless they are you know a validator or you know you're running an exchange or a business and you you know you need your you know back end to that uh you know i guess the the vision of that there was at the start of like well yeah everyone will be running their own node and you you so you've got mist on top of it and you know it's it's local apps you know and then that that can have swarmed for the smart contracts and you know you it's almost like you won't have server architecture because everyone's running a server stack and then yeah that that did not happen

**[36:47] SPEAKER_01:** actually actually that's so that's why uh we are also stuck with the with the json rpc api which doesn't provide proofs except for it get proofs but doesn't provide proofs for a lot of things because um because it was never meant to be used remotely it was always imagined that yeah it's used locally in a trusted setup on your own machine and yeah and yeah i remember all those good old days when i just uh synced up a full node it was a few gigabytes of this space and ran mist on top of it and yeah all the it's magic but uh yeah unfortunately uh it didn't scale so no no at the uh museum of

**[37:29] SPEAKER_03:** ethereum here i've i've got uh laptops uh running geth 1.36 so home homestead geth and i uh i i mind homestead back to life so um you know any any hard fork that happens the other the old one doesn't go away right it doesn't disappear it's just people don't associate any economic value with it and it kind of gets abandoned but yeah what i've done is uh is is first gpu and then down to cpu mind that homestead difficulty down to the level that you can cpu mine it again so i do i have i have i have got mist running on those so we can go we can go and transact we can send a transaction between those and and it should be possible to uh to run aleth0 and aleth1 and mix on that as well i haven't had time to do that but and and you know erc20 tokens existed you know you could have have dow tokens or mist coin yeah at that time but uh yeah the the the assumption that people would run their own node and it would all be you know self-sovereign local apps certainly uh did not come to fruition well yeah that's when the

**[38:56] SPEAKER_01:** light client came in and then we assumed that okay then we do the light client and yeah it will be all

**[39:00] SPEAKER_03:** solved that's it yeah that's what i was thinking is like right i've got i've got a full node running on my smartwatch that works and i'll just wait for for you and the other guys to you know sort out

**[39:11] SPEAKER_01:** light client and just turn that on and there we go well actually the light client protocol worked fine it's just uh yeah i i spent like a really crazy amount of uh time figuring out uh how it could be decent uh like like incentivized in a truly decentralized way because uh yeah i i remember this uh there was this idealism that that uh yeah now now we are almost done with everything so we just have to find a real proper way for incentivizing things but not in a way that there's a few companies where you can buy like tokens but truly in a decentralized way which is much harder because yeah then we have to somehow this build decentralized trust and and and figure out market mechanisms that work without initial trust so yeah uh this is something i spent years with and honestly i think i came up with some nice theoretical models and a lot of really complex code but uh yeah it's just uh again was like the wrong approach maybe also at the wrong time so we were just not there really yeah because i mean

**[40:29] SPEAKER_03:** bit torrent has obviously worked for distributing uh content for many many years but then you you do have this tragedy of the commons right is uh yes the latest hollywood movie someone has ripped it off and people want that so that's going to get shared around no problem but things which are only of interest to a smaller number of people without incentives it's just a a leeching problem right you kind of good good full node runners would would contribute you know they'll turn on the les as well right they would help supply that but the incentives and economics are that uh not easy yeah actually with bitter end it

**[41:16] SPEAKER_01:** also uh usually if you really want to use it it requires trackers that where you buy some some some some some priority access so right there are these these these private trackers and everything yeah so yeah uh uh and and those are this is also like not uh completely decentralized but actually it does work so it's it's it's it's definitely better than nothing but uh for for alias it wasn't really this easy because this whole service was uh like uh downloading movies was was an application that everyone understood that everybody used and uh somehow with ethereum it was always this yeah everyone felt the importance but if you're nowhere near close to like like like a really mature ecosystem and uh and so so it was just i don't think there would have been a big enough market really for these services to so that to really work out in a market-based way yeah but uh as we as a scale and uh accessing the whole dataset is uh becomes more and more difficult at a certain point i think we are going to have something like reimagined several years ago so yeah it's it's just uh both like timing and specifics yeah i was i was i was right about everything except timing and specifics yeah yes yes yeah uh i mean there's a number of

**[42:51] SPEAKER_03:** things that that seemed like they would be easy and quick and obvious and have taken so many years i mean like like proof of stake you know the it was in the white paper there was an assumption you know later in 2015 that'll happen you know within six months maybe three six months um and then it's it's eight years before you know it actually went live and uh and yeah i mean on storage so filecoin their first white paper was in 2014 as well you know filecoin was not a a new thing um and ipfs was around before ethereum as well um but uh and then yeah whisper kind of went for a while and then now there's there's there's um and and and you'd have you've had status driving a lot of those texts for a lot of those years as well you know jared hope and team uh who were also doing uh android version of the the java client you know the same kind of time as i was looking at smart watches you yeah jared hope was also very

**[44:06] SPEAKER_01:** eagerly waiting for for for like the fully functional like client yeah yeah yeah well

**[44:12] SPEAKER_03:** yeah because you know they were building kind of decentralized we work you know super app but i i guess you know kind of a competitor to to mist really similar kind of thing you know wanting to have a uh you know a container for running uh daps in sitting on top of a local client again you know having this completely self-sovereign kind of server app stack but not not easy and i can't remember who it was that was telling me that so when they first saw metamask uh which was at devcom one that was one of the grantee winners was was metamask them thinking no we that's not what we want we we don't want like you know some browser extension thing talking to a trusted endpoint like that's absolutely the opposite like what what are these guys doing and then that's you know that's become the standard flow right well yeah so

**[45:18] SPEAKER_01:** uh this is this is still kind of an unsolved problem to right to to access access uh everything in a truly decentralized way but uh i think we are getting
