**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** So, hello and welcome to FDenver 2026. So here recording for Early Days of Ethereum with Zolt Felfeldy. How do you pronounce your name?

**[00:14] SPEAKER_01:** Zolt Zelfeldi.

**[00:16] SPEAKER_00:** There you go. Anyway, so yeah, I was working out when we recently reconnected at DevConnect and I was working out that you're the third longest person at the Ethereum Foundation. Right. You've got Vitalik and then Felix and then you.

**[00:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I haven't really checked this fact yet, but honestly, yeah, it sounds great.

**[00:46] SPEAKER_00:** That's it. So, I mean, you're a very long time member of the Geth team.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_00:** But what were you doing before you started at the foundation? What was your, your background? How did you find your way into the blockchain world?

**[01:02] SPEAKER_01:** Well, before Ethereum, I was working on really different types of projects. So I first started at a Hungarian software company, like really classic software company. We actually sold software in boxes like put on a shelf, like floppy disks. Put in a box on a shelf and you can buy the software. So like, like this type of like classic, classic software.

**[01:35] SPEAKER_00:** Five and a quarter. Five and a quarter inch floppies.

**[01:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, actually three and a half.

**[01:42] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, okay. Three and a half. We're on to modern floppies.

**[01:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, but maybe also like, like in. I started in 97, so maybe I was exaggerating a little. So by that time it was mostly, mostly CDs. We still used a lot of floppies anyway, so those. So at that company I did things related to. First things related to computer graphics. Like I wrote a ray tracing engine for some architectural software. And then I also did a lot of work on electronic circuit simulation and circuit design.

**[02:20] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[02:21] SPEAKER_01:** So yeah, really different things. And it was around 2011 when I first heard about Bitcoin and around 2012 when I started to realize that as weird as it sounds, it really is probably a big thing. Actually I first heard About Ethereum early 2014, a few months after the initial paper has been published.

**[02:53] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[02:54] SPEAKER_01:** And yeah, started contributing I think around November and officially joined EF at in 2015, March. So. Yeah.

**[03:05] SPEAKER_00:** And did you hear about it, you think, through, like through Danny and Victor or some other way?

**[03:14] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I, I did hear about it from like Danny and Victor's friend circle. So.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, but then Victor was already. Actually, actually I never didn't know Victor before. So I, I met. Heard about this thing through one of Denny's friends and then, then Victor was also in that wider circle and he came to Hungary and said, oh, I'm Already working on this. And then I, I started with my ideas and started to explain to him why this thing was probably will never work. And he was like, okay, you seem to have a good understanding of this. Why don't you come to work?

**[03:52] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right. And was I right in thinking that you said it was Swarm that you started with?

**[04:00] SPEAKER_01:** Well, yeah. So Swarm was part of this initial trinity of base technologies of Ethereum. So was supposed to be the storage layer for dapps. Yeah, I mean it was kind of a naive way of like how people imagine the decentralized applications back there. But honestly it made sense at the time. So I will say that, yeah, never, nothing ever turned out exactly the way that people imagined it. But we are still making a lot of progress. Progress. So yeah, Swarm was how we initially imagined this storage layer for Ethereum. And I mean this project still has merits, but yeah, this whole problem space is just a bit more complex. But yeah, so I started contributing to Swarm first and actually I brought the first 500 lines of Swarm.

**[05:02] SPEAKER_00:** There you go. Yeah, I mean I, I think if I remember rightly that Victor mentioned around May 2014 was when he first heard, you know, the trinity, this, this concept that you could have, you know, Ethereum as your sort of your compute an expensive database, Swarm as your decentralized storage and then Whisper as your messaging was that famous diagram, right, with the. There's like a circle and the things coming in and Whisper going around the edge and there's another one of those. But yeah, I mean, I guess it was devcon0 where Danny really presented a sort of a fleshed out vision of what that decentralized storage.

**[05:54] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that's correct. I wasn't there at DEVCON 0 yet. So I've heard about this idea even before I heard about Ethereum. So Danny Oradeesh told me about this idea that he wants to do these kinds of hash based chunks storage and. Yeah, so it made total sense that he just pitched that.

**[06:14] SPEAKER_00:** That can fit in.

**[06:16] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, at the time it was a perfect fit. Yeah. So he pitched this idea @Defcon0 and, and when they accepted it and hired Denny, then he called me and said because he already knew that I know of this project and. Yeah, then let's do it together.

**[06:38] SPEAKER_00:** There you go. And then. So you were hired into fdev? I did have a date for that. I've forgotten. I guess it was shortly after DEVCON 0, right. That you started there?

**[06:51] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, correct.

**[06:53] SPEAKER_00:** Did you go to Berlin or Amsterdam? When did you first meet other people? How did.

**[07:01] SPEAKER_01:** It was Amsterdam in February 15, right. That's where I met Jeffrey Wilke, the creator of Goethereum and the Go Ethereum team. Back then, I don't say get because their GATT was, was like this abbreviation was invented later. So yeah, that's where I met the Go Ethereum people. And I already had these contributions to Swarm and it was kind of an implied thing that maybe I might be hired, but there was really no official hiring process back then. Yeah, it was really just Jeff was this really laid back guy and he just, he just said, okay, okay man, I saw your contributions and let's talk some sometime this week. And I waited the whole week and waited for some, some serious interview like it was a dream job for me. Yeah, like, but by that time I, sorry. I was really enthusiastic about this whole thing and, and I felt like. So even though I felt that this whole initial design was. Yeah, I really couldn't imagine how it would scale and everything. And it is a hard problem. So yeah, it was true, but it was still worth starting it and I was really enthusiastic and I really wanted to get hired. And yeah, the whole week I just waited. And at the end of the week, like last half an hour before we all left home, Jeff just said, oh yeah, man, I wanted to talk to you. You're hired. Okay, that's a good talk. So, yeah, this is how the hiring process went back then.

**[08:50] SPEAKER_00:** Excellent. Well, that's easy. And so you, that was before you went to Amsterdam, I assume, I assume you went to Amsterdam after you had been hired.

**[09:04] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, no, it happened in Amsterdam.

**[09:06] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, you, I see. So you were there unhired on site.

**[09:10] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so, so I like, like Jeff agreed that if, I mean, I bought my own plane ticket but I could stay at the Airbnb team stayed and yeah, I just worked with them and showed my contributions and yeah, so, so I, I, I, I went to Amsterdam unhired.

**[09:27] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, I mean, Right, right.

**[09:29] SPEAKER_01:** That plane ticket was a good investment. So.

**[09:31] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So did they not have office space at that point even?

**[09:36] SPEAKER_01:** Well, they did actually back then there was an Amsterdam office.

**[09:40] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[09:41] SPEAKER_01:** It was mostly for Jeff because Jeff lived in Amsterdam. But when Jeff left ef or maybe before that, I'm not sure exactly, but so this office was closed and actually it was a really small office last time I checked. Now I think it's a dentist, like works there. So yeah, it doesn't exist, but it was really just a small, small place. But I later I went to Berlin a lot. So after I was hired and yeah, it Was. It was for the GET team. It was the really, really. It was centered in. In somehow in. In Berlin, so.

**[10:24] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right. Because, yeah, I mean, I guess as well as Jeff, you've got Baz. Right. He was another Amsterdam person. Right. Bas Van Kerwal. But then maybe most of the other team members weren't in Berlin. Sorry, not in Amsterdam. I mean.

**[10:43] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah. No one else was in Amsterdam. Bas was there for a short time. Relatively short time. And Jeffrey also left after a while and started his own company. Developed games or something. Yeah.

**[11:01] SPEAKER_00:** Though he did have. Oh, ETH Labs was another one. Do you know anything about ETH Labs? Because when Jeff worked with JP Morgan to do Quorum, that was announced under the label F Labs. Never heard of that.

**[11:18] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think I heard the name, but I didn't really know what it does. But yeah, this is something I knew that Jeff started working with JP Morgan in that time big Banks really, really wanted to just talk to us at every defcon and we were always invited to fancy dinners by some main people and so. So Venks really wanted to learn about the technology. So Jeff went for a while to work on Forum. Yes.

**[11:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I mean, unless I can somehow get in contact with Jeff. I guess it's a little bit of a mystery what exactly F Labs was. Though I suspect it might be a little bit like Ethersphere of just sort of being a name, a banner for activity activities rather than a legal entity. And another thing I don't know there, but I suspect is I don't think Jeff told Ming that he was doing that stuff with jpm. I suspect that he completely just did that on his own without any communication with Ming or with the ef. It's just he went and did it.

**[12:35] SPEAKER_01:** He never really told a lot to us about that. So we knew that. Yeah, he's working with JP Morgan, but probably it's a big bang. Probably he had to sign contracts on disclosure agreement, so just he probably couldn't share all the details.

**[12:51] SPEAKER_00:** No, no. I mean, I remember at some point and I can't remember the context, him saying he found it interesting because the consensus for that was on chain. Like the consensus for that was happening as smart contracts. So it was kind of almost like this pluggable consensus, but consensus pulled up, you know, into the app layer. So he found that quite interesting that the initial quorum consensus, it didn't last long, but I think Gav also was doing that sort of stuff on the C side that he did some proof of authority stuff before that happened on the Geth side before clique, there was this. Okay, well he actually made a different C client, so you've got eth, but he made another one that was called Fluidity or something which was pulling all the libraries in the same, but it was with a proof of authority consensus. But that was one of the last things he did before he went out to Parity. So I think both him and Jeff were interested at that. Thought of, well, how can you formulate these pieces in different ways for those kind of use cases? Interesting. But yeah, he left. I think it was. I think it was probably very early in 2017. I did find a period, but it was certainly ahead of. Ahead of DEVCON 3. Let me see if I can find the date.

**[14:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I don't remember the exact date and actually there was maybe there wasn't even a really exact date when Jeff left because basically a month after I joined, Peter Sinaidi joined and he was the team lead for a very long time. So Jeff basically kind of handed it over to Peter and for a while he was officially still team lead, but not really. We haven't seen seen him on the calls for a while.

**[15:14] SPEAKER_00:** No. So the date I found there was February 2017. But I think I got that from GitHub. I think that was like his final commit. But he probably tailed off a long time before that.

**[15:28] SPEAKER_01:** He already started focusing on other stuff like this forum stuff and his own things sometime in 16. So.

**[15:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, so started a company called Grid Games with his brother building. Building a particular game though that also seems to have ceased. So. Yeah, he's unknown off in the world somewhere.

**[15:51] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's pretty much all I know about him. We try to invite him a few times to just come to some event and meet up. But yeah, I think for some reason he really had enough of maybe not us, but, but, but things going on in, in the EF and.

**[16:13] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think that would be the case that you. You know, when Ming came in, she both did legal tidy up, but also cut the spending a lot. You know that you'd had the crowd sale in July, August, September 2014, but coming up to the mainnet release a year later, like nearly all the money was gone. Yes, they spent it very fast.

**[16:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So DEFCON 1 was postponed because of that, but we didn't really feel a lot of this. Actually Jeff just said that now that the ether price is so low. Actually I think the lower point was 42 cents.

**[17:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And full year it didn't really move.

**[17:04] SPEAKER_01:** And Jeff just said that. Okay. We all have to take a payment cut but the payment cut was really just 10% and I think maybe he took a bigger one. So yeah, for us it was really not that bad. And the idea was that when ether price reaches $2 then yeah, we do have some go back some, some, some time to some money to go forward. So yeah, then, then our, our salaries went back. So. And that wasn't a lot of time. So yeah, actually for, for I think, yeah, this, I don't, don't really remember the price history and maybe it's not the most important thing but, but I think iterprice reached something like $10 pretty soon.

**[17:56] SPEAKER_00:** Just in the start of 2016.

**[17:58] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, and we went even a little bit higher. But then we had the dao fork and the Shanghai attacks and well, given how turbulent those times were, the market held pretty well and with $10 Enterprise we could survive further.

**[18:17] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, I mean that was quite a jump up. I mean I heard that at the worst point there was only four months of Runway left. You know, that was how close it was to running out of money. But yeah, there were those big cuts which really, you know, resulted in like Gav and the C team were the main kind of like victims of those cuts. But then, yeah, just into 2016. Pardon me. So I was hired in February 2016, same time as Greg Colvin came in and also Pavel was rehired. You know, he, he was working through imap, you know, working on that jit. But they, that contract stopped. But then, then he came back at that time as well. So it was this, this period through late 2015 to early 20s. Sixteen was like, you know, the absolute bottom of like are we even going to ship this thing? Are we going to run out of money before we get to mainnet? But then yeah, some of us were really coming in as backfill for that. For that C team. Yeah. So I mean DEFCON 1 was sort of, you know, you were mentioning in that series that had got canceled, but then consensus came in and actually like paid for that and said hey, we'll will like mainly organize it and kind of so that the thing can happen. So that was the big, you know, the first public event. So what are your memories of Defcon1?

**[20:00] SPEAKER_01:** Well, my subjective impression was that it's really amazing. Yeah. Compared to today's DEFCON, it was small, I think 300 something people maybe, but I'm not sure, but less than a thousand definitely. And yeah, it was really, really prestigious venues. Some old bank building on Threadneedle Seat street, like city of London. And yeah, I really felt like, okay, so now this is really a serious thing. And probably that was the reason why consensys stepped in and funded the event so we really could step up in terms of public appearance and appear as something really serious. And yeah, I remember all the big banks having the booths at DEFCON 1.

**[20:56] SPEAKER_00:** Right? Yeah. And then Microsoft as headline sponsor. It's like wow. Recognition, right? That you're like, wow, Microsoft are interested and supportive and yeah, I mean, I think for a lot of people it was a real kind of wow. Like this is for real. You know, sadly, I could not afford to go. I watched the livestream. I was not, I was not quite in and working yet. I was an enthusiastic contributor. But

**[21:34] SPEAKER_01:** yeah, so actually it was also like the first time for me when I met a larger number of Ethereum people. So yeah, I first met the Go Ethereum team in like early 15. And yeah, I went to Amsterdam one more time I think in May. But DEFCON 1 was the place where I really realized how big this thing is and, and it's really not just about client developers, but also even back then people presented about formal verification and all this stuff. So yeah, I realized that this is really big and probably everyone wants to be a part of it at least a little bit.

**[22:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, looking back at DEFCON 1 videos, it's like everything, like any kind of use case you could think of, you know, there was somebody presenting about it, you know, just so, so early, more than 10 years ago. But you know, many, many concepts which were probably like massively too early to do, but maybe you can do them more now seem to be presented. You had Nick Szabo as well. Nick Szabo doing a keynote.

**[22:49] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nick Sabo was also there.

**[22:53] SPEAKER_00:** So was that maybe the first time that you'd met a number of the people in Berlin like Christoph Jantz and Lefteris and maybe even Gav?

**[23:03] SPEAKER_01:** I think I met some of these people already in London and I think first time I went to Berlin office back then it was like the other. Like it was like the old office. Yeah, right. But so yeah, some people I met at Defcon1, some people I met in Berlin.

**[23:22] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah. So no. So was that. Was DEFCON 1 the first time that you'd been to do Ethereum things in London or did you. Did you go to any sort of London meetups or meet any of those comms people earlier?

**[23:41] SPEAKER_01:** I didn't go to any meetups to London before, but actually I I did. So Victor, Victor was in London at the time and, and I was, I, I went to London around the time actually if you're doing some, some, some. Event with my old software company, the Hungarian software company.

**[24:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[24:10] SPEAKER_01:** So we went to London to, to like, like, like, like sell our software and everything. So I'm still working there.

**[24:17] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[24:17] SPEAKER_01:** And after that, yeah, I met up with Victor and talked about Nice, yeah,

**[24:21] SPEAKER_00:** Ethereum related things because yeah, he, From what he was describing and then I was looking at videos and things later. He had seen Gav talk in London in very, very early February, I think it was February 6th. So almost immediately after they'd had the Miami like you know, BTC Miami launch, you know, Vitalik's first public talk and, and the, you know, Anthony Di Orio's like mansion where they, you know, a lot of them met for the first time. Gav had been back in London, I think it was like a week, a week after and did a talk there that Victor had gone to. That was Victor's first, you know, in person meeting with any of these. And then you know, Gavard pulled him on board.

**[25:19] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so those are like the very early days I wasn't there. So when I first heard about Ethereum that was I think March or April 14th. So, so I first heard about the pre sale and yeah, that's where I first heard about this thing. But yeah, I know that Gavin was one of the very early founders of this and he wrote the yellow paper full of Greek ladders.

**[25:51] SPEAKER_00:** Very confusing. Yeah. And the C client of course. So the first time I think I saw your name or was in contact with you was about Light Client because I'd been trying to get Ethereum, ARM Linux cross builds running on my smartwatch and my thought there was get the thing running and then this Light client stuff is just kind of starting and scaling will be solved. Right. We're going to be able to run these nodes on anything. You know, you'll have them on your phone, smartwatch, router, they'll be in every operating system. You know, it's just will solve that scaling and that lightness. So you were plunged right into that problem. Right?

**[26:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So when Jeff hired me actually he put me on this, he has put me on this project. So he just said that, okay, it's great that I contributed to Swarm, but if I join the GATT team I will have to start working on the Light client because it's a very important thing and it hasn't been started yet. So yeah, I felt really good about It, I also felt like this is a big thing and yeah, back then it really felt like we do these few things, we have a working light client protocol and, and the whole trinity of base layer and then we're all good. Yeah, it wasn't that easy, but still those were the first steps and so I designed the LES protocol. In retrospect, it didn't make a lot of sense to design to build it over the devp2p layer because it, it wasn't easy to access from web browsers stuff. But also, also it was, it was a proof of work based light client.

**[27:51] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[27:52] SPEAKER_01:** So yeah, that, that project ended after a while but I'm still very much into like trustless chain access. So that's, that has usually been one of my focuses all the time. So right now I'm also working on, on something called the Trustless Execution Layer API which is similar to the Beacon REST API but works on the execution layer and provides everything with proofs. So yeah, I'm still very much into this because I think this is where Ethereum really makes sense if even normal users access chain data with proofs.

**[28:36] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right. And there was a project called Portal as well. Were you involved with Portal? That was a later kind of light client.

**[28:44] SPEAKER_01:** No, I wasn't. So Portal was Piper Mariam's brainchild. So by the time we kind of realized that LES was a nice first experiment, but maybe not the best approach, he started something different that was UDP based and also used different topologies. So it was kind of a DHT approach to storing the chain and the state. And yeah, actually I'm kind of, I think it's a bad thing that it, it's been completely canceled because actually to be honest, I never really believed that it will be an easily solvable problem to store the Merkel Petrusha tri of the state on dht but for the chain data it made perfect sense. So yeah, maybe, maybe the state would have been possible with a lot of work. But yeah, I mean Piper told me of few times about how he imagines to solve all the unsolvable problems and I felt like yeah, it sounds good but he just made a lot of really hard assumptions about VHTs that by the time I already worked on Discovery V5, so there was also this discovery protocol that basically we designed it in 2016 in Berlin with Felix.

**[30:20] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[30:20] SPEAKER_01:** And I released the original version and yeah, so. So I already knew that. Yeah, it's, it's, it's never so easy to imagine like a DHT that's that's efficiently formed and all the nodes are working and yeah, like this. So but, but for the, for the, for the chain data.

**[30:37] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[30:37] SPEAKER_01:** Especially with EIP 444. So like, like that lets the MEME protocol, the nodes processing meme protocol forget the ochain history. So it made perfect sense to at least put the chain history on a dht. But yeah, so it was an EF decision that it was discontinued at a point.

**[31:05] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I mean, I guess the thing is, you know, Patricia Merkle trees are not great for you know, the number of accesses and things anyway, let alone if you're making each of those steps over a networked, you know, DHT kind of setup. That's. Yeah, there's a lot of. It's so much transactional change complexity.

**[31:31] SPEAKER_01:** State 3 suffers from a lot of issues, especially in the Merkur Patricia State 3. Yeah and yeah, it's a huge data set that keeps changing all the time and keeps changing at completely random places and it's not as easy as task to distribute it. So actually it's getting harder to even synchronize it between full node storing the entire stuff.

**[32:00] SPEAKER_00:** So do you think that proofs are going to be a magic, you know, magic silver bullet here where by having you know, local proofs versus you know, massive really redundant state machines. Do you think there's a path here where.

**[32:19] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, oh yeah. No, it's not a silver bullet. So I assume you mean what people call statelessness. So it's a good thing. It definitely allows higher degree of scanning. But the state tree still has to be processed and maintained by someone and especially if most of the nodes have no incentive to process it. And yeah, now we are talking about 100x and thousandx scaling then even if we also do state expiry which is currently imagined in a way that we basically reset the state tree every year or something and have multiple state trees. So yeah, that has somewhat. But if we scale a thousand x then it will be a huge infrastructural centralization issue.

**[33:21] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[33:21] SPEAKER_01:** And yeah, by the way, this thing is not an unsolvable problem. I mean the state as it works today, unfortunately somehow makes it really hard to do any fundamental improvements over these properties. But people are considering different storage architectures. Of course we have to keep the existing contracts workable because that was our main promise from the beginning that we will not just shut down anything. Everything has 100% uptime. But it is a viable way to come up with more efficient storage methods and use it as an opt in alternative that will over time be available for much less and new contrast can be designed using those more efficient storage architectures.

**[34:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, because Verkal trees seem to be the first sort of thought on that. But then that's kind of come and gone and maybe it's a binary tree

**[34:37] SPEAKER_01:** or actually it does either.

**[34:40] SPEAKER_00:** You don't think it's so important either.

**[34:42] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, I mean, I mean both are better than the Merkel Patricia 3 but in some ways. But they don't solve this fundamental issue by themselves. So still the thing is that the state is a permanent key value store and in order to avoid it growing forever. Yeah there's all these ideas about state expiry, but still it's going to be a huge data set and the method of hashing or consensus protocol representation doesn't fundamentally change this. So Verkle was supposed to provide more efficient Merkle proofs but also I guess somewhat more expensive state processing because it's like more expensive cryptography. Also if I'm correct, it's not quantum secure. So. And that was also a thing that I always felt like yeah, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to start working from now and I just saw it in front of my eyes how it's going to be canceled.

**[36:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, I guess for running nodes in general, you know there's not a lot of incentive for people to run any kind of like node software themselves unless they are you know, a validator or you know, you're running an exchange or a business and you, you know, you need your node back end to that. You know, I guess the vision of that there was at the start, start of like well yeah, everyone will be running their own node and you, you. So you've got mist on top of it and you know, it's, it's local apps, you know and then that, that can have swarmed for the smart contracts and you know, you, it's almost like you won't have server architecture because everyone's running a server stack and then yeah,

**[36:46] SPEAKER_01:** that, that did not happen actually, actually that's. So that's why we are also stuck with the, with the JSON RPC API which
