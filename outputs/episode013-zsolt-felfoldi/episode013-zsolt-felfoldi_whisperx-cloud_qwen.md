**[00:01] SPEAKER_03:** So hello and welcome to DevCon Denver 2026. So here recording for Early Days of Ethereum with Zoltan Felfoldi. How do you pronounce your name? Jolt? Jolt? There you go. Anyway, so yeah, I was working out when we were recently reconnected at DevConnect, and I was working out that you're the third longest person at the Ethereum Foundation, right? That you've got Vitalik and then Felix and then you.

**[00:34] SPEAKER_01:** Felix and then you. Yeah, I haven't really checked this fact yet, but honestly, yeah.

**[00:44] SPEAKER_03:** Sounds great. That's it. So I mean you're a very long-time member of the Geth team, yes. But what were you doing before you started at the Foundation? What was your background? How did you find your way into the blockchain world?

**[00:58] SPEAKER_01:** Well, before Ethereum, I was working on really different types of projects. I first started at a Hungarian software company, like a really classic software company. We actually sold software in boxes, like on a shelf—discs, like floppy disks. Five and a quarter inch floppies? Actually, three and a half. Oh okay, three and a half—we're on to modern floppies. But maybe I was exaggerating a little. In '97, it was mostly CDs, but we still used a lot of floppies. Anyway, at that company, I did things related to computer graphics. I brought a ray tracing engine for some architectural software, and then I also did a lot of work on electronic circuit simulation and circuit design. Really different things. It was around 2011 when I first heard about Bitcoin, and around 2012 when I started to realize that, as weird as it sounds, it really is probably a big thing. I first heard about Ethereum in early 2014, a few months after the initial paper had been published, and I started contributing around November and officially joined EF in March 2015.

**[03:02] SPEAKER_03:** Did you hear about it through Danny and Victor or some other way?

**[03:10] SPEAKER_01:** I did hear about it from Danny and Victor's friend circle. I didn't know Victor before, but I heard about this thing through one of his friends. Then Victor was also in that wider circle, and he came to Hungary and said, "Oh, I'm already working on this." Then I started with my ideas and started to explain to him why this thing probably will never work, and he was like, "Okay, you seem to have a good understanding of this. Why don't you come to work?"

**[03:52] SPEAKER_03:** Right. So I'm right in thinking that you said it was Swarm that you started with?

**[03:59] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, Swarm was part of the initial trinity of base technologies of Ethereum. It was supposed to be the storage layer for dApps. It was a naive way of imagining decentralized applications back then, but it made sense at the time. Nothing ever turned out exactly the way people imagined, but we're still making a lot of progress. Swarm was how we initially imagined the storage layer for Ethereum. This project still has merits, but the problem space is just a bit more complex. I started contributing to Swarm first and actually brought the first 500 lines.

**[05:02] SPEAKER_03:** There you go. I think if I remember rightly, Victor mentioned around May 2014 was when he first heard about the trinity—that concept where you could have Ethereum as your compute, an expensive database, Swarm as your decentralized storage, and Whisper as your messaging. There's that famous diagram with a circle and things coming in, Whisper going around the edge. And I guess it was DevCon 0 where Danny really presented a fleshed-out vision of decentralized storage.

**[05:51] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that's correct. I wasn't there at DevCon 0 yet, but I'd heard about this idea even before I heard about Ethereum. Danny already told me about this idea that he wants to do this kind of hash-based chunk storage. It made total sense that he pitched that—it was a perfect fit at the time. He pitched this idea at DevCon 0, and when they accepted it and hired Danny, he called me because he already knew I knew of this project, and said, "Let's do it together." So there you go.

**[06:40] SPEAKER_03:** So you were hired into EF Dev. I did have a date for that—I've forgotten. I guess it was shortly after DevCon 0, right? Did you go to Berlin or Amsterdam? When did you first meet other people?

**[07:07] SPEAKER_01:** It was Amsterdam in February '15 where I met Jeffrey Wilcke, the creator of Go Ethereum, and the Go Ethereum team back then. I don't say "Geth" because that abbreviation was invented later. That's where I met the Go Ethereum people. I already had these contributions to Swarm, and it was kind of implied that maybe I might be hired, but there was really no official hiring process back then. Jeff was this really laid-back guy, and he just said, "Okay, man, I saw your contributions. Let's talk sometime this week." I waited the whole week for some serious interview—it was a dream job for me. I was really enthusiastic about this whole thing, even though I felt the initial design wouldn't scale. It was still worth starting. At the end of the week, the last half an hour before we all left, Jeff just said, "Oh yeah, when I wanted to talk to you—you're hired."

**[08:47] SPEAKER_03:** So that's how the hiring process went back then. Excellent. That was before you went to Amsterdam, I assume?

**[09:07] SPEAKER_01:** No, it happened in Amsterdam. I went to Amsterdam unhired. I bought my own plane ticket but stayed at the Airbnb where the whole team stayed. I just worked with them and showed my contributions. So I went to Amsterdam unhired.

**[09:29] SPEAKER_03:** That plane ticket was a good investment. Did they not have office space at that point?

**[09:35] SPEAKER_01:** They did. Back then, there was an Amsterdam office, mostly for Jeff because he lived in Amsterdam. But when Jeff left—or maybe before that—the office was closed. It was a really small place. Last time I checked, it's now a dentist's office. It doesn't exist anymore. I later went to Berlin a lot after I was hired, and for the Geth team, it was really centered in Berlin.

**[10:27] SPEAKER_03:** You've got Bas, right? He was another Amsterdam person—Bas van Kesteren?

**[10:41] SPEAKER_01:** Sorry, not in Amsterdam. Yeah, no one else was quite distributed. Bas was there for a short time, relatively short, and Jeffrey also left after a while and started his own company.

**[10:57] SPEAKER_03:** Right, developing games or something. Though he did have FLabs—do you know anything about FLabs? When Jeff worked with JPMorgan to do Quorum, that was announced under the label FLabs.

**[11:20] SPEAKER_01:** I never heard of that. I think I heard the name, but I didn't really know what it does. I knew Jeff started working with JPMorgan back then. Big banks really wanted to talk to us at every DevCon. We were always invited to fancy dinners by main people. Banks really wanted to learn about the technology. Jeff went for a while to work on Quorum, yes.

**[11:56] SPEAKER_03:** I suspect FLabs might be a little bit like Ethosphere—just a name or banner for activities rather than a legal entity. I also suspect Jeff didn't tell Ming he was doing that stuff with JPMorgan. He probably did it on his own without any communication with Ming or the EF.

**[12:34] SPEAKER_01:** He never really told a lot to us about that. We knew he was working with JPMorgan, but probably, as a big bank, he had to sign a non-disclosure agreement, so he couldn't share all the details.

**[12:54] SPEAKER_03:** I can't remember the context, but he found it interesting because the consensus for that was on-chain—the consensus for Quorum was happening as smart contracts. It was kind of almost like pluggable consensus, but consensus pulled up into the app layer. He found that quite interesting. The initial Quorum consensus didn't last long, but I think Gav was also doing that sort of stuff on the C++ side. He did some proof-of-authority stuff before that happened on the Geth side—before Clique. He actually made a different C++ client. You've got Eth, but he made another one called Fluidity or something, which was pulling all the libraries in but with a proof-of-authority consensus. That was one of the last things he did before he went out to Parity. I think both him and Jeff were interested in how to formulate these pieces in different ways for those kinds of use cases. He left—I think it was very early in 2017. I did find a period, but it was certainly ahead of DevCon 3. I don't remember the exact date.

**[14:44] SPEAKER_01:** There wasn't even a really exact date when Jeff left. Basically, a month after I joined, Peter Szilagyi joined, and he was the team lead for a very long time. Jeff basically handed it on to Peter. For a while, he was officially still team lead but not really—we hadn't seen him on the calls.

**[15:13] SPEAKER_03:** The date I found was February 2017, probably from GitHub—that was his final commit, but he probably tailed off. He'd already started focusing on other stuff like Quorum and his own things sometime in '16.

**[15:37] SPEAKER_01:** He started a company called Grid Games with his brother, building a particular game, but that also seems to have ceased. He's unknown off in the world somewhere.

**[15:52] SPEAKER_01:** That's pretty much all I know about him. We tried to invite him a few times to come to some event and meet up, but for some reasons, he really had enough—maybe not of us, but of things going on in the EF.

**[16:09] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, when Ming came in, she did legal tidy-up but also cut spending a lot. You'd had the crowdsale in July, August, September 2014, but coming up to the mainnet release a year later, nearly all the money was gone.

**[16:36] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, they spent it very fast. DevCon 1 was postponed because of that. We didn't really feel a lot of this. Jeff just said that now that Ether price is so low—the lowest point was 42 cents—and it didn't really move for a full year. Jeff said we all have to take a payment cut, but it was really just 10 percent, and maybe he took a bigger one. For us, it wasn't that bad. The idea was that when Ether price reaches two dollars, we'd get some money back. Then our salaries went back, and that wasn't a lot of time. I think in 2016, Ether reached something like 10 dollars pretty soon, and we went even a little bit higher, but then we had the DAO fork and the Shanghai attacks. Given how turbulent those times were, the markets held up pretty well, and with 10 dollars, we could survive further.

**[18:18] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I heard that at the worst point, there was only four months of runway left—how close it was to running out of money. There were big cuts, which really resulted in Gavin and the C++ team being the main victims. I was hired in February 2016, same time as Greg Colvin came in, and Pavel was rehired. He was working through Imap on that JIT, but that contract stopped, and then he came back. Late 2015 to early 2016 was the absolute bottom—were we even going to ship this thing or run out of money before mainnet? Some of us were backfill for the C++ team. DevCon 1 was supposed to be canceled, but Consensus came in and paid for it, saying, "We'll mainly organize it so the thing can happen." That was the first public event. What are your memories of DevCon 1?

**[19:55] SPEAKER_01:** My subjective impression was that it was really amazing. Compared to today's DevCons, it was small—maybe three hundred something people, less than a thousand. It was in a really prestigious venue, some old bank building in Threadneedle Street, City of London. I really felt like, "Okay, now this is really a serious thing." Probably that's why Consensus stepped in and funded the event—we could step up in public appearance. I remember all the big banks having booths at DevCon 1, and Microsoft was headline sponsor. It was wow—recognition that Microsoft was interested and supportive.

**[20:59] SPEAKER_03:** Sadly, I could not afford to go. I watched the live stream. I was not quite in and working yet—I was an enthusiastic contributor.

**[21:34] SPEAKER_01:** It was also the first time for me when I met a larger number of Ethereum people. I first met the Go Ethereum team in early '15 and went to Amsterdam one more time in May, but DevCon 1 was where I realized how big this thing is—not just client developers, but people presenting about formal verification and all this stuff. I realized this is really big, and probably everyone wants to be a part of it.

**[22:20] SPEAKER_03:** Looking back at DevCon 1 videos, any kind of use case you could think of, somebody was presenting about it—so early, more than 10 years ago, but many concepts that were probably too early to do, maybe you can do them all now. You had Nick Szabo as well—Nick Szabo doing a keynote. Was that maybe the first time you'd met a number of the people in Berlin, like Christoph Jentzsch and Lefteris?

**[23:00] SPEAKER_01:** Terrace and maybe even Gav. I think I met some of these people already in London, and the first time I went to the Berlin office, it was the old office. Some people I met at DevCon 1, some in Berlin.

**[23:24] SPEAKER_03:** Was DevCon 1 the first time you'd been to do Ethereum things in London, or did you go to any London meetups or meet any of those comms people earlier?

**[23:39] SPEAKER_01:** I didn't go to any meetups in London before, but I did go to London around the time—I was doing some event with my old Hungarian software company, selling our software. I was still working there, and after that, I met up with Victor and talked about things.

**[24:23] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, he had seen Gav talk in London in very early February, I think February 6th—almost immediately after the Miami B2C Miami launch, Vitalik's first public talk, and Anthony Di Iorio's mansion where they met for the first time. Gav had been back in London a week after and did a talk there that Victor had gone to—that was Victor's first in-person meeting with any of them, and then Gav pulled him on board.

**[25:22] SPEAKER_01:** Those were the very early days. I wasn't there. When I first heard about Ethereum, that was March or April '14—I first heard about the pre-sale. I know Gav was one of the very early founders. He wrote the Yellow Paper, full of Greek letters.

**[25:51] SPEAKER_03:** Very confusing. And the C++ client, of course. The first time I think I saw your name or was in contact with you was about light client, because I'd been trying to get Ethereum ARM Linux cross builds running on my smartwatch. My thought was: get the thing running, and this light client stuff is just kind of starting. Scaling will be solved—we'll be able to run these nodes on anything: phone, smartwatch, router, every operating system. You were plunged right into that problem.

**[26:38] SPEAKER_01:** When Jeff hired me, he put me on this project. He said, "It's great that you contributed to Swarm, but if you join the Geth team, you'll have to start working on the light client because it's a very important thing and hasn't been started yet." I felt really good about it. Back then, it felt like we do these few things—we have a working light client protocol—and then we're all good. But it wasn't that easy. Those were the first steps. I designed the LES protocol. In retrospect, it didn't make a lot of sense to build it over the DevP2P layer because it wasn't easy to access from web browsers. Also, it was a proof-of-work-based light client. That project ended after a while, but I'm still very much into trustless chain access. That's usually been one of my focuses all the time. Right now, I'm also working on something called the Trustless Execution Layer API, which is similar to the Beacon REST API but works on the execution layer and provides everything with proofs. I'm still very much into this because I think this is where it really makes sense—if even normal users access chain data with proofs.

**[28:36] SPEAKER_03:** Right. And there was a project called Portal as well—were you involved with Portal? That was a later client.

**[28:42] SPEAKER_01:** No, I wasn't. Portal was Piper Meridian's brainchild. By the time we realized LES was a nice first experiment but maybe not the best approach, he started something different that was UDP-based and used different topologies. It was a DHT approach to storing the chain and the state. I think it's a bad thing that it's been completely canceled. To be honest, I never really believed it would be easily solvable to store the Merkle Patricia trie of the state on the DHT, but for the chain data, it made perfect sense. Maybe the state would have been possible with a lot of work. Piper told me a few times about how he imagines solving all the unsolvable problems, and it sounded good, but he made really hard assumptions about DHTs. By the time I worked on Discovery v5, which we designed in 2016 in Berlin with Felix, I already knew it's never so easy to imagine a DHT that's efficiently formed with all nodes working. But for chain data, especially with EIP-4444, which lets main protocol nodes forget all chain history, it made perfect sense to put the chain history on a DHT. It was an EF decision that it was discontinued.

**[31:06] SPEAKER_03:** Patricia Merkle trees are not great for the number of accesses, let alone if you're making each of those steps over a networked DHT setup. There's a lot of transactional change—complexity. State trie suffers from a lot of issues.

**[31:32] SPEAKER_01:** Especially in America, Patricia state trie—it's a huge data set that keeps changing all the time in completely random places. It's not an easy task to distribute it. It's getting harder to even synchronize it between full nodes over the entire state.

**[31:59] SPEAKER_03:** Do you think that proofs are going to be a magic silver bullet here—by having local proofs versus massive redundant state machines? Is there a path where...

**[32:24] SPEAKER_01:** It's not a silver bullet. I assume you mean what people call statelessness. It's a good thing—it definitely allows a higher degree of scaling—but the state tree still has to be processed and maintained by someone. Especially if most nodes have no incentive to process it, and now we're talking about hundred-x and thousand-x scaling, even with state expiry—which is currently imagined as resetting the state tree every year or something and having multiple state trees—it will still be a huge infrastructural centralization issue. This is not an unsolvable problem. The state as it works today makes it really hard to do fundamental improvements, but people are considering different storage architectures. We have to keep existing contracts workable because that was our main promise from the beginning—100% uptime—but it is a viable way to come up with more efficient storage methods and use them as an opt-in alternative that will over time be available for much less, and new contracts can be designed using those more efficient storage architectures.

**[34:26] SPEAKER_03:** Because Verkle trees seem to be the first sort of thought on that, but then those have kind of come and gone. Maybe it's a binary tree or actually...

**[34:40] SPEAKER_01:** Both are better than the Merkle Patricia tree in some ways, but they don't solve this fundamental issue by themselves. The state is a permanent key-value store, and to avoid it growing forever, there are ideas about state expiry, but it's still going to be a huge data set. The method of hashing or consensus representation doesn't fundamentally change this. Verkle was supposed to provide more efficient Merkle proofs but also somewhat more expensive state processing because it's more expensive cryptography. Also, if I'm correct, it's not quantum secure. That was also a thing where I always felt unsure if it's a good idea to start working on it now. I just saw it in front of my eyes how it's going to be canceled.

**[36:04] SPEAKER_03:** For running nodes in general, there's not a lot of incentive for people to run any kind of node software themselves unless they are a validator, running an exchange, or a business needing a backend. The vision at the start was that everyone would run their own node—you'd have Mist on top, local apps, Swarm for storage—it's almost like you won't have server architecture because everyone's running a server stack. That did not happen.

**[36:47] SPEAKER_01:** That's why we're also stuck with the JSON-RPC API, which doesn't provide proofs except for eth_getProof, because it was never meant to be used remotely. It was always imagined to be used locally in a trusted setup on your own machine. I remember those good old days when I synced up a full node—it was a few gigabytes—and ran Mist on top of it. It was magic, but unfortunately, it didn't scale.

**[37:29] SPEAKER_03:** At the Museum of Ethereum, I've got laptops running Geth 1.36—Homestead Geth—and I've mined Homestead back to life. Any hard fork that happens, the old one doesn't go away—it's just people don't associate economic value with it and abandon it. I've done GPU and then CPU mining to lower Homestead difficulty so you can CPU mine it again. I have Mist running on those—we can transact, send transactions between them. It should be possible to run Aleth0 and Aleth1 and Mix on that as well. ERC-20 tokens existed—you could have DAO tokens or Mist Coin. The assumption that people would run their own node and it would all be self-sovereign local apps certainly did not come to fruition.

**[38:56] SPEAKER_01:** That's when the light client came in, and we assumed, "Okay, then we do the light client and it'll be all solved."

**[39:00] SPEAKER_03:** That's what I was thinking—right, I've got a full node running on my smartwatch that works, and I'll just wait for you and the other guys to sort out the light client and just turn that on.

**[39:11] SPEAKER_01:** Well, the light client protocol worked fine. It's just that I spent a really crazy amount of time figuring out how it could be decently incentivized in a truly decentralized way. There was this idealism that we're almost done with everything, so we just have to find a proper way for incentivizing things—not in a way that there are a few companies where you can buy tokens, but truly decentralized, which is much harder because we have to build decentralized trust and figure out market mechanisms that work without initial trust. I spent years on this, came up with some nice theoretical models and a lot of complex code, but it was just the wrong approach, maybe at the wrong time. We just weren't there really.

**[40:29] SPEAKER_03:** BitTorrent has obviously worked for distributing content for many years, but you do have this tragedy of the commons. The latest Hollywood movie someone has ripped—it gets shared around no problem. But things only of interest to a smaller number of people, without incentives, it's just a leeching problem. Good full node runners would contribute—they'd turn on LES as well—but the incentives and economics are not easy.

**[41:16] SPEAKER_01:** With BitTorrent, if you really want to use it, it usually requires trackers where you buy priority access—private trackers. It's not completely decentralized, but it does work. For Ethereum, it wasn't this easy because downloading movies was an application everyone understood and used. With Ethereum, everyone felt the importance, but if you're nowhere near a mature ecosystem, there wouldn't have been a big enough market for these services to work out in a market-based way. As we scale and accessing the whole dataset becomes more difficult, at a certain point, we're going to have something like reimagined. It's just both timing and specifics. I was right about everything except timing and specifics.

**[42:51] SPEAKER_03:** Things that seemed easy, quick, and obvious have taken so many years. Like proof of stake—it was in the white paper. There was an assumption in 2015 it would happen within six months. It took eight years before it actually went live. On storage, Filecoin's first white paper was in 2014. IPFS was around before Ethereum. Whisper went for a while, and now there's Status driving a lot of those texts for many years—Jarrad Hope and team, doing an Android version of the Java client around the same time I was looking at smartwatches.

**[44:06] SPEAKER_01:** Jarrad was also eagerly waiting for a fully functional client.

**[44:12] SPEAKER_03:** They were building a decentralized super app—a competitor to Mist, wanting a container for running dApps on top of a local client, completely self-sovereign server app stack. Not easy. I can't remember who told me, but when they first saw MetaMask at DevCon 1—one of the grantee winners—they thought, "No, we don't want some browser extension talking to a trusted endpoint—that's absolutely the opposite." And now that's become the standard flow.

**[45:18] SPEAKER_01:** This is still kind of an unsolved problem—to access everything in a truly decentralized way. We're getting there over time, but nothing is as simple as we initially imagined. There's a time for everything. Decentralized infrastructure will be forced by scaling. Sometimes things just don't happen if they're not forced by some external factor. As long as it lazily works to just connect MetaMask to Infura, that's the standard way.

**[46:15] SPEAKER_03:** I found two different talks of yours at DevCons talking really about light client. Do you remember—did you talk in London or was Shanghai your first?

**[46:22] SPEAKER_01:** I talked at London, Shanghai, and Cancun. Those were the first two DevCons mostly about the light client. The first release of the light client protocol was in '16. Later, I started inventing all the next chapters of decentralized technology. It was really naive of me, but I also had this project where I tried to make logs provable efficiently. The initial attempt was in 2017, and now I'm back at it with the Trustless Log Index project. The 2017 approaches were just a more efficient way to organize bloom filters, but it didn't solve the problem of bloom filters not adapting to the number of events. I never even proposed putting it into consensus, which would have allowed actual trustless proofs through the chain. That proved to be a hard problem. This is one of the things I presented in Cancun. Also, my ideas of state channels—back then, Layer 2 just meant something that happens off-chain, not necessarily another blockchain. I had ideas about individual nodes running their own blockchains and organizing off-chain calculations through that, but it assumed a lot about how those would operate and probably would never have worked.

**[48:50] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, we had state channels, then Plasma, then optimistic rollups and ZK later—many different attempts. So, 10 years worth of lots of people trying lots of different things. In terms of the Geth team, has that been similar over the years, or have you had larger and smaller amounts of people? Has it been a similar kind of flow?

**[49:36] SPEAKER_01:** I would say it was pretty consistently around 10 people throughout all these years—sometimes eight or nine, sometimes 11 or 12. We did improve our internal processes, so now we have issue and pull request triages. The team was always small enough that we didn't need a lot of processes. The team culture did change with certain people coming and going, but it was always a good team culture. I always liked the Geth team—that's why I never really looked into moving to other teams or projects. I felt that team was the best place to do meaningful things.

**[50:54] SPEAKER_03:** From the very start of Ethereum, the intention was to have multiple clients—that was a basic decision: separation between specification and implementation, unlike Bitcoin with one codebase and no competition.

**[51:21] SPEAKER_01:** For Bitcoin's complexity, that approach worked. For Ethereum's complexity, this was one of the best decisions. It also contributed to almost running out of money by mainnet launch, but I'd say it was money well wasted.

**[51:43] SPEAKER_03:** Not efficient, but the outcome was very much worthwhile. When we switched to proof of stake, we successfully applied this pattern by funding multiple CL implementations and testing every EL against every CL.

**[52:08] SPEAKER_03:** There are five different primary consensus clients, all independent companies and teams. On the execution side, there have been a good number of alternative execution clients over the years. How do you tend to work and interact in that environment—starting with Parity, then Bazooka, Nevermind, Aragon? How do you work with other teams?

**[52:58] SPEAKER_01:** We have all the ACD calls and testing calls. Mostly, we all have working clients all the time, so by default, we don't need to interact a lot. We interact when testing new features—there are prep forums for that. Some people keep more contacts outside the Geth team; some focus inward on Geth issues. In the first years, communication wasn't organized well—we just tried to figure things out, and some people knew people from other teams. These days, we have much better processes. It's a much bigger challenge because there are so many more people. I realized this during the time we started working on proof of stake in 2017. Ether price went to several thousand dollars, and the Foundation had money to hire new teams and fund external teams. Until 2017, I mostly met non-Geth people at DevCons. I was always in Hungary and worked remotely. Around 2018, so many researchers and teams were hired. At DevCon 4 in Prague, I was shocked—there were so many people from the Ethereum Foundation. Now we have official forums, and I try to go to more events, not just DevCons, to keep contacts live.

**[56:00] SPEAKER_03:** Looking back to when you first started working on Ethereum, did you have any thought or vision of what things might have looked like 10 years later? Has it worked out as you expected or differently? What's your looking back on these 10 years?

**[56:24] SPEAKER_01:** I always had a lot of visions. Maybe I was too focused on vision sometimes. We all have to imagine the future at every point, even though we know it won't turn out exactly as we want. We always have to have some direction. Around 2017, I realized scaling wouldn't happen just with L1. I had ideas about solving problems more efficiently with application-specific state channels. There was Raiden—they properly implemented the protocol, but it always struggled with not many people using it. There's a pain that transactions are expensive, but somehow we missed some organizing force to really move to Layer 2 solutions.

**[58:08] SPEAKER_03:** It was meant to be Lightning for Ethereum. Lightning's kind of failed, so maybe not surprising if an Ethereum version didn't really get traction. You have routing issues—it's really complicated. Channels work great for consistent static topographies, like merchant to merchant.

**[58:44] SPEAKER_01:** Channels work great, but opening those channels is still costly and non-trivial. I installed it and tried it—interesting, but I never really made a payment through Raiden because there was just no occasion where the other party really wanted a Raiden transfer.

**[59:11] SPEAKER_03:** Well, thank you very much. I think we can wrap it up there. Thanks for your time and all your work on Geth over these many years. Geth has always really been the backbone of Ethereum—new clients come and go, but Geth remains.
