**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** So hello and welcome to Early Days of Ethereum. I am delighted today to be joined by Fabian Vogelsteller. Is that the correct pronunciation?

**[00:15] SPEAKER_01:** Like an F? The V is more like an F. But yes.

**[00:19] SPEAKER_00:** Right, very Germanic pronunciation. That's not going to come out of my mouth. So yeah, you know, great to see you. We saw each other at Devconnect in November, I think, for the first time for quite a while and had a good catch up there. But hello.

**[00:44] SPEAKER_01:** So hey, yeah.

**[00:47] SPEAKER_00:** What were you doing prior to wandering into the blockchain world?

**[00:59] SPEAKER_01:** So exactly, let's start from the beginning. Okay, so what I was doing before blockchain, I was actually a web developer. I mean, I built websites since I was 14. Feindura, the name that I have on Twitter, is actually the name of the content management system that I built, I think in 2005. And it just happened to be turning into my second identity. So I have two identities on the Internet: frozeman and Feindura. It's all just connected to two things in GitHub. I'm frozeman and that's also my GitHub history with Ethereum and so on. And Feindura is then my online one. Yeah, I mean, I basically was always interested in the cutting edge of the cool Internet stuff in the 90s. Building my first websites in 1998, 1999, following the whole evolution of the Internet with HTML, HTML 1 and 2, and CSS 1 and 2, and JavaScript coming in, and so on. So I mainly did web development, but I studied media design, so I didn't study anything with coding. All the coding is autodidactically learned. There's nothing that came from computer science. Honestly, even when I joined Ethereum, I had no clue about bytes and how to manipulate bytes and stuff. I still don't actually, I still don't know.

**[02:37] SPEAKER_00:** Didn't have your computer science background. I don't have any computer science background.

**[02:42] SPEAKER_01:** Not sure what I'm doing on the computer. I just know how to interact with high-level languages, and now I only know how to speak to AI and to my team.

**[02:52] SPEAKER_00:** That's all you need. Things changed and you wrote a book.

**[03:01] SPEAKER_01:** I wrote a book about Meteor.js. I got really obviously into web development. I did a lot of websites and built a lot of things. I built my own content management system in PHP and I built a flat-file based content management system. So that means that this doesn't need a database. The whole idea was, okay, I just want to have one of these FTP PHP ready servers, and if I want to move over, it was literally all about the independence of hosting providers. Right? If I want to move from this hosting provider to the other. I mean back in the day, migrating databases was a nightmare, and probably still is a nightmare. Oh yeah, it was. If I build a flat-file based thing, you just copy the whole folder structure over to the other server and it works. And it did. So that was what the feindura.org CMS does and did. I mean obviously, who uses PHP today? Beside Facebook? No, but yeah, now I have a bunch of haters in the PHP community, but yeah, I built that thing and that was really helping me to kind of do a full project front to end. And then I got more into JavaScript and I got really excited by Meteor.js, which was one of the first reactive JavaScript frameworks. That was before Angular, before React, and it was the first time where you could just write this JavaScript code and this HTML stuff, and when you update stuff in the JavaScript or in your local state, the HTML got re-rendered natively. Super magic. So I got really into this and I wrote a book about it. I have it here. If you ever wanna read it. I would never read a tutorial book, to be honest. But I wrote one thing.

**[05:04] SPEAKER_00:** Do people even read books anymore?

**[05:06] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I honestly would never even read them. It was so much work to do this. And the reason why I did is because they reached out to me and I thought, yeah, I could do that. And then Marjorie, my ex-wife back in the day, encouraged me, and I thought, okay, why not? But in the end, it was a lot of work. I mean literally four months of waking up, and I had a two-year-old kid at the time, or maybe a year old, I don't remember. And I had to wake up very early at five to write two, three, or five pages, whatever, and then go to work. It was intense. You get an hourly rate of like 10 cents. So it made totally no money. I literally probably made exactly like 10 cents per hour or something like this.

**[06:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[06:02] SPEAKER_01:** But it's reputation, and in a way I think that's also what got me into Ethereum, because what is this writing single page apps with Meteor? And what is a dapp? It's a single page app.

**[06:18] SPEAKER_00:** It is.

**[06:18] SPEAKER_01:** The whole point is it literally runs in your browser, doesn't require a backend. And I actually built a tool that allowed you to strip out the server part of the Meteor app so you can handle it as a local app. It's actually a quite popular repository called Meteor Build Client. And yeah, that's what I used for dapps in the early days in Ethereum too.

**[06:46] SPEAKER_00:** Is Meteor still an active project? Is anyone using Meteor still?

**[06:52] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I totally think so. I think so, yeah. I don't know how frequent they are. I haven't checked it out in a long time. No.

**[07:10] SPEAKER_00:** But I mean, it was quite a revolution at the time. The single page app.

**[07:15] SPEAKER_01:** It was the first, you know, it was one of the first. It was the first framework that I know that really was a proper framework and it just solved the whole thing from account creation to reactive DOM updates to server and client synchronization. It was magic. Yeah, it blew a lot of people away. And then all the others, React and so on, were kind of more like answers to this. And then React brought it back to the weird way of mixing code and UI in the same files, which I already found very bad in PHP times.

**[07:52] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[07:53] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[07:56] SPEAKER_00:** And then I guess you sort of found your way into the Bitcoin world in some form?

**[08:02] SPEAKER_01:** So, yeah, 2013, I heard about "Canadian wants to sell house in Bitcoin." And I thought, okay, wow, what's that? Somebody's selling a house in a currency I've never heard of. And that really led me very quickly down the rabbit hole. This was March 2013. That was literally when Bitcoin hit $200 in that very exact month. And number one, I saw, okay, there's money to be made here. I was a student with no money, so you have your hope: okay, maybe I can make a little bit of money on the side this way. But I really quickly understood the fundamental power of this technology. And it took me about a year to really understand how it works fully. I mean, I literally had this epiphany every month where I thought, now I know how it works. Ah, it took me a year to really construe my brain, you know, no servers, no frameworks, and how this basic stuff works. The crypto and blockchain stuff was just so out there in the way how this stuff works. But yeah, so I was in the space, and obviously right after I joined the Bitcoin community, then there was the first altcoin, Litecoin. And then in 2013, there were a lot of projects that were created trying to imitate Bitcoin or do an improvement or do alternate versions. I also got really into Mastercoin, the idea of just writing onto the Bitcoin blockchain rather than creating a separate blockchain.

**[09:49] SPEAKER_00:** Right. And you're in Berlin. Right? Were you going to meetups or did you find fellow developers?

**[09:56] SPEAKER_01:** It was just online. There were no meetups at the time, really. Like not in my region. So what actually happened in 2014, there were then some meetups, and so I heard about Ethereum. I knew that I just felt immediately that this is a really powerful approach, but it also sounded so unrealistic. So when I heard this, I looked at the white paper. I never really read the Ethereum white paper actually ever fully. I literally just skipped over it, and I listened to Vitalik, or the early things that were floating around, and I knew this is it. The idea of making this computation machine on the blockchain makes total sense. I just thought it's so hard to do. I didn't really give it a lot of chances that they'd pull this off. But then they pulled it off pretty quickly, and it just happened so that I was at a meetup in Berlin, a Bitcoin meetup, I think the first one I was ever at.

**[10:55] SPEAKER_00:** Can you imagine what kind of month that was?

**[11:06] SPEAKER_01:** I think it was August 2014. It was literally like a week before the Ethereum presale started.

**[11:18] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[11:19] SPEAKER_01:** Like literally days before. So I met these guys from Ethereum. In this case, it was Aaron Davis, who did the accounting at the time.

**[11:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[11:29] SPEAKER_01:** And they told me that they were going to open an office in Berlin and that there's some kind of news coming out next week, but he can't tell me. And I was already following Ethereum. I was already waiting for the ICO. And yeah, then it happened. So I took all my Bitcoin that I had at the time, which was 12 Bitcoins, and converted them into ether. I mean, people think like, oh my God, 12 Bitcoins, but they were like $600 worth or whatever. It was literally not much. I put them all into ether, or pretty much everything. And I knew this is going to be big. I felt it. And this was also the first project where I thought I would love to work for this project, because it's not about finance, money, and wallets. Because every Bitcoin startup at the time was just about creating a wallet, and I was rarely interested in creating wallets. And so it just happened that about six months later, you know, Bitcoin happened, ICO happened, attention came, blah, blah, blah. I got an email from a recruiter saying the company Ethereum is looking for a C++ developer, and I was not a C++ developer. Recruiters don't check anything on LinkedIn, I guess, or GitHub. But I knew that they were now looking. So I went to their office and I just chatted with Aaron again and I saw this office here in Waldemarstrasse. And I realized that, okay, actually they are really just thinking that they're going to build the nodes and then people will build on top of the stack. And I just knew, you know, I know how to build single page apps. This is what you need. I knew this is what they will need to show what a dapp can be and show how to do it. I just felt it. And so I said, like Aaron, just ask around internally. And they had one Skype group that was kind of like the Discord group at the time. Yeah, and funny enough, Alex van de Sande is the one who came on board as the UX designer also just a month before me. And he had this whole idea of creating this Mist browser concept, and I think when Alex heard that there's this guy that came up here that can build single page apps, then Alex thought, oh, that could be the person who can help with building the Mist browser. So he convinced Jeffrey Wilcke, I mean that's my assumption of what happened. And he tried to call me up, and I was in Turkey on holiday. So I didn't pick up the phone. And then when I came back I saw someone called me up, and somehow I think I called him back, and yeah, he said, hey, you want to work here? We want to do this and this.

**[14:28] SPEAKER_00:** Was that Aaron that you were talking to again?

**[14:30] SPEAKER_01:** No, this was avsa. So avsa wanted to have me because I think he probably convinced Jeffrey because he saw me as a guy who can help build his idea. Right. And Jeffrey was kind of skeptical of hiring anyone that's not a core developer. What the hell can you do, I guess is what he thought. Probably thought JavaScript cannot work.

**[14:58] SPEAKER_00:** So you started in January 2015. So I guess this discussion would have been in December 2014.

**[15:08] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly. Yeah, it was mid-December. I was on holidays, he tried to call me, and yeah, he asked when to start, and he said, yeah, start in January. And Jeffrey obviously really wanted to prove me, so he thought, okay, let me just throw a really complicated task at him and then he will fail anyway and we can get over with this whole thing. I think that's what Jeffrey thought. So he said, okay, build a chat app for the Whisper protocol. So in Ethereum there was the Web3, right. The idea of Web3 was the network, storage (Swarm), and communication (Whisper). Which by the way, I only figured out later that Web3 means exactly these three things. Fun fact, I always thought it's like, sure, Web2, we go to Web3. But that was actually the three components.

**[15:56] SPEAKER_00:** Right. It's kind of a bit of a joke that you've got both. And I was just looking, so it was November that Alex had done his Mist concept presentation. So I guess that was really quite fresh. It's like, okay.

**[16:15] SPEAKER_01:** So he had the idea and then they were working on it already early December, and I forgot his name. But the French guy who then worked on Remix. I'm sorry, I forgot.

**[16:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yann Levreau.

**[16:30] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly. So Yann actually built an early version of the Mist browser, but I think in C++ or something like this.

**[16:42] SPEAKER_00:** There was one called Aleph0.

**[16:43] SPEAKER_01:** Maybe it was a really early kind of Mist. It was barely working and obviously the whole connection stuff was not figured out properly yet. And they just really realized quickly that this is not the way to go. And that's why maybe Alex saw an opportunity here with this JavaScript dude showing up with the single page app book or whatever.

**[17:04] SPEAKER_00:** You'd had Aleph0 as well, right? I guess that was the very first GUI thing. Maybe that's what you were thinking of with Yann.

**[17:13] SPEAKER_01:** Maybe Aleph0 was the one.

**[17:15] SPEAKER_00:** That was like a really ugly programmer's tool. Kind of like mission control.

**[17:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think Aleph0 was that early Mist browser. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so Jeffrey said, hey, let the guy build a chat app on the Whisper protocol. I got dropped into this novel tech, no documentation, no idea how the shit works, and I was supposed to build a whole chat app using this protocol, and that was crazy. But because I really knew how to build single page apps that are reactive and I could work with Yann actually—he gave me just the endpoints that I need to use to get the account and to do the sending the messages and stuff like this—I pulled it off and built a chat app. And the first time we met in March or April, all together in Amsterdam, we all used the Whisper chat app to talk to each other. Encrypted chat messaging, including groups, and I added topics. So in a channel, you could basically say, I want to talk about a certain topic. And then you could filter by the topic so you could see all messages or you could say, I want to only see this or that topic. And it's the same like threads in Discord, by the way. So I basically made the thread concept of Discord in this tiny app and it worked. And you were connected with your wallet that was stored in your Geth node. And I think Jeffrey was quite impressed and that kind of gave him some confidence that I can do it. Even though he was trying to prove me wrong or prove himself right that it's not going to work.

And what's crazy is we literally built the Mist browser in like three months. We built the first working version and we released it with the mainnet. We released the Ethereum Wallet that was July 31, 2015. So basically, six months later, seven months later, we released the first Mist browser version. And it was so crazy because everything needed to be figured out. I needed to learn how all this stuff works. And initially, in the first two months, it felt literally impossible. I felt like, there's no way I'm going to figure this shit out. There was no documentation. It was completely over my head in terms of complexity and shit that I didn't understand at all. But I pulled it off and I had to. Obviously there were people around me that I could talk to, but everybody was also so busy and had to figure out their own thing, because everything had to be figured out at the time. But I had to literally touch every point. I had to work with the RPC API. And then I saw this thing was kind of messy. Sometimes it was returning hex, sometimes it was not returning hex. So I immediately tried to fix things and make them proper. I basically immediately wanted to make sure this is proper because when we launch the nodes, this stuff can't change anymore because once we start Mainnet, you don't want to constantly make devs' stuff unworkable. So I had to fight with Gavin Wood to fix and change the endpoints. And that was already quite a little bit of an uphill battle, let's say. Then I had to get into Web3.js, which Marek Kotewicz was working on with the original JavaScript library that I think Gavin and Jeffrey started, and then I had to help work together with him initially. And then I really contributed to Web3.js because we had to build that into the Mist browser directly. So I was literally the first user of that library and really contributed to that library as well.

**[21:16] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[21:16] SPEAKER_01:** We had to make everything up. The whole foundational stack of Ethereum we made up in this first few months. And because I built the piece that put it all together—the node, the dapps, Web3.js, the RPC endpoint, everything into one app—I had to literally touch everything and I had to go to talk to everybody. That was quite challenging, not going to lie. And I also realized that Jeffrey's team and Gavin's team were a little disconnected, and they tried to... there was still a little battle and war going on where everybody wanted to be the one who determines which feature and how. And I just realized, guys, if we are doing this, it's going nowhere. It would be too complicated, too many iterations. So I tried to make these two teams talk. But Jeffrey's team, you know, I was part of Jeffrey's team. We were a little bit more open, at least how I felt. Gavin really wanted to keep everybody under a bucket and he didn't want us to talk to his team. But I found back-channels to make them sync up. I guess Gavin didn't like that, but it was really needed so that eventually they started to work more together. I had to do a lot of connecting and handholding because I was in this crazy position of being hired by the Amsterdam team while sitting in the office of Gavin's Berlin C++ team. So I was the connector, the translator basically. And I had to deal with all the pieces. The C++ client had to work in the Mist browser, as did the Go client. So I had to talk to people when something was not working. It's crazy how much happened in those first six months before the network started. I mean, equally on the network side. There was so much just being built and done at the time, but the whole dapp tech stack was literally made up in this moment, in this time.

**[23:33] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean I was just looking at the timeline. So September 16th, 2015 is when the first developer preview of Mist went live. I mean saying about those two teams, I guess you were sort of in the position of being the very first person building one layer up. I guess all of the prior efforts were just about the clients and making features available on the clients but not really building things on top. And specifically not building things on top to try and be able to work with either.

**[24:18] SPEAKER_01:** To be fair, the first dapps probably were built by Gavin and Jeffrey, but they used all the clunky half-ass stuff.

**[24:30] SPEAKER_00:** They're only on their own stack. Right.

**[24:32] SPEAKER_01:** And then only on their own stack. Yes. I built the first number one dapp browser, literally a generic tool that can run any JavaScript app to connect to the blockchain. And I built it with Alex's Ethereum Wallet, which was the first ever dapp on Ethereum. Like the genuinely properly done, designed, cross-client functional thing. Yeah, that's exactly what we did.

**[24:57] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, but yeah, all of that prior stuff, it was really just on their own stack.

**[25:05] SPEAKER_01:** A little JavaScript page talking to their own endpoints.

**[25:08] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, right. I mean, looking through old videos, there was one which I think was a talk in London where both Jeff and Gav were sort of talking about the state of Ethereum and demonstrating some things. This was October 2014, and one of the demos that they had was probably the first on-chain DEX. You'd got GavCoin and JeffCoin, prior to any standards. GavCoin was written in LLL and JeffCoin was written in Mutan. But they did do an on-chain DEX order book. So putting a transaction for an offer, like CPU mining, picking that up. You had got that interop and I guess maybe some of the Whisper stuff was maybe cross-client, but the UI layer...

**[26:19] SPEAKER_01:** So for the chat app, I mainly used the Go client because the Whisper thing on the C++ client was not fully integrated or working properly. The initial idea was that the Ethereum client will host all three things: Swarm, Whisper, and the network. Obviously Swarm never really worked in there, neither did Whisper, which later got overtaken and supported by Status, and now it's transferred into a whole different protocol. It's interesting. This was really foundational times, and what people constantly misunderstand is how much, number one, Ethereum was generic from day one. Number two, how many ideas were already present. If you watch the Mist browser video from Alex, we haven't even built half of the stuff that's in that video! In fact, a lot of these foundations are still missing. For example, now I'm working on Universal Profiles across smart contract systems, and that's even in the video already. You don't see wallets, you see profiles, you see people doing stuff. And only now, literally 10-plus years later, we finally have the foundation, and it's not even widely used yet, that makes that Mist video more realistic. Alex came up with all of these ideas because this is just what was around at the time. Even right after Bitcoin got attention in 2013 and 2010, these ideas were already around: how can you build a decentralized Uber and decentralized this and decentralized that and DEXs and whatever. People think this stuff came online in 2017 or 2020 and that it is somehow an invention of the Ethereum Foundation making shit up. This stuff has been around for ages.

**[28:33] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean you had that cryptocurrency 2.0 phase at the start there, talking about Mastercoin and things. I guess there was a thought that everything would get built on Bitcoin. You've got these altcoins and experiments, and then coming back together, or even prior to Bitcoin, because Bitcoin itself was just a manifestation of digital cash dreams that had gone back for decades with the cypherpunks. And then you'd got things like BitTorrent. You did have decentralized messaging things.

**[29:18] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, I mean back in the day it was all Reddit, right? Today it's Crypto Twitter, but back in the day it was Bitcoin Reddit or /r/Bitcoin. And Ethereum was the first real challenger to the status quo. And it split the community into the Bitcoin maximalist camp that says, no, we only need Bitcoin, why the heck do you want any other chain? And then the people who went to Ethereum. Even in my friend circle and friends who are developers, some literally never made the move. They never looked into the Ethereum stack just because they felt that Bitcoin is all you need. I just visited a Bitcoin meetup recently and I was so taken back because it was like walking into a time portal back 10 years. Same discussions, same problems, same people, same size of groups, and you're suddenly back in some time capsule of the past where the topics are minor this, minor that... basic stuff that has been figured out a hundred times already on Ethereum. Very impressive discussions there, but very few developers, which is also impressive—how a network with so much attention and money is literally just developed by 100 people, maybe not even.

**[31:02] SPEAKER_00:** Well, speaking for myself, I was aware of Bitcoin for a good number of years before I had any involvement in the crypto space. But there were two or three reasons I wasn't interested. Firstly, I was a gold bug. Secondly, I was a software engineer and I knew how terrible most software is. So some dude you've never heard of has made magic Internet money? Like, come on. But I think more importantly, it was just kind of boring to me because, okay, you can do payments. Well, there you go. Well, that's not very interesting. Versus here's a platform and you can build apps. That was like, oh, that's kind of interesting. And you maybe had a fairly similar trajectory.

**[31:46] SPEAKER_01:** For me, the money part was... obviously it's cool to invest in something you feel is going up and making money. I had no money as a student. My parents are not rich. But it was just so powerful, the idea that there is a technology that no one can control, that sits above the law, that sits above the influence of humans. Because you can't break a system that's based on consensus. Like a Hydra with 100,000 heads. It was fascinating. I still am super pumped about the next phase of this whole technology. But I just never thought it would take that long, to be honest.

**[32:49] SPEAKER_00:** No, no. So you were working from the Berlin office, but presumably you were back and forth to Amsterdam sometimes?

**[32:58] SPEAKER_01:** The Amsterdam office, we were there maybe twice or so in the end. The Amsterdam office was really more like a legal hub, and there was obviously Jeffrey and the personal assistant that he had, and we were all over the place. So I worked with Alex mainly, who was literally three to five hours behind in Brazil, in Rio. Later we hired multiple people. We hired another person from Rio actually. Two other people from Rio. At some point we were three or four people in the team. But then I also worked on Web3.js, so I worked with Marek Kotewicz closely, who was in the Berlin office. I talked and worked with Christian Reitwiessner a lot, who worked on Solidity, also in the Berlin office. And obviously Yann Levreau and the other girl that worked on Remix. Lefteris Karapetsas was sitting across from me in the Berlin office. Christoph Jentzsch came to the Berlin office frequently. But he was more hired as a contractor to do testing scenarios for the nodes. So he wrote all these tests to check inputs and outputs or whatever node behavior cross-client.

At the same time, the Berlin office functioned as the main go-to place if you wanted to visit Ethereum. It was the place where there were the most people. It just happened that people showed up. Dominic Williams just showed up. People I met that really became friends: Gustav Simonsson, who built a key manager implementation in Go Ethereum; Felix Lange, the guy who still today builds the network layer, he was also in the office in Berlin, literally lived across the street. And there was a lot happening. I was one of the more social developers inside the group, so when somebody walked into the office, it was mostly me talking to that person because the others just behaved like they didn't know what to do. And there was no secretary or anything really. So I talked to most of the people. And you know, working on the front end, working on the developer stack, I was kind of on the layer to the outside compared to the people working on the inner protocols. So that also reflected socially.

**[36:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right. So you missed out on Devcon 0 because you started just after that. But you went to London for Devcon 1 in November of 2015 then?

**[36:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was there.

**[36:23] SPEAKER_00:** Token standards were just kind of beginning. The EIP process was just starting. So I guess that's sort of phase two, right? First you build a thing and touch everything, and then you start getting up to that on-chain token layer. How did all that grow up?

**[36:48] SPEAKER_01:** So the whole standardization for me started when Vitalik created the GitHub wiki page because he wanted to standardize tokens, ENS kind of registries, and maybe an early version of a DEX, I don't remember. We had some discussions around the GitHub page, literally a GitHub docs page. He made the early version of ERC-20, and we debated a little bit mainly on Skype and via comments on this page. And then London happened. So it's actually funny because there was this panel about standardization. I presented a lot of things there. I presented the Mist browser. But I was also on this panel about standardization. Fun fact, we discussed—I watched it the other day—standards, and there were two main discussions. "Should we put metadata into the contract directly?" In this case, the idea was do we put the metadata of a token—like token name and symbol—into the contract, or do we create a registry for it?

**[38:10] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[38:11] SPEAKER_01:** And in a way, that's still the big split today. Do you put information into a registry like ENS, or do you put it into the user-owned contract itself, or do you make a registry for AI, or do you put the metadata in the account of the AI itself? We literally discussed this, and it's funny, they asked us what we were interested in regarding standardization. And I said, the account system. I called it a proxy contract because there was no notion of an account. But I called it a proxy contract. It was actually my main interest. Funny enough, I later created ERC-725 and Universal Profiles as the fulfillment of that. I talked about key management at the time, and we didn't even propose the ERC-20 on that panel.

But in this conversation, Martin Becze, before creating the EIP repository, or Gavin Wood or whoever, mentioned: where do we do the standardization? And I think he mentioned, yeah, we have the EIP repository. That would be the right place. And I think that inspired me right there: oh yeah, actually we could put it there. So that's when I created issue number 20. And I called it the Ethereum Request for Comment. I created the issue, and I formatted this whole discussion that we had in a proper specification because I felt, number one, we need to involve the community. If you want to have a consensus around the token standard, everybody needs to listen and have at least an insight. And second, it needs to be in a structured way where not everybody randomly edits this file. We all laughed about editing on that one wiki file. In a way, I then structured the process. I made a few changes for ERC-20, just moving things around like the transfer function, value, amount... And then we had a discussion, but we didn't really change much anymore. And yeah, around 60 people participated, 300 comments. The big discussion was around "authorized operator" or not. Should we have it or not? I was kind of against it.

Fun fact, when I created the first test coin, the Mist Coin, that I used to test in the Mist browser, I left out the authorized operator function because I didn't like it. I really liked more the idea of informing recipients. But it was too early to do that because we had no idea of the side effects. So in my test coin, I just didn't add the authorized operator; I didn't see a need for it. Fun fact, later people picked up the Mist Coin as a collectible meme token. And because it was a real ERC-20, but because it didn't have the authorized operator function, it didn't work in Uniswap. So they wrapped it. And that's why it's now Wrapped Mist Coin, which is the real Mist Coin inside a token that DOES have the function to interact with DEXs. But this was just a test token. I just gave a bunch of those to random people over the years who asked me, until a whole group of people wanted to make it valuable. And now it has a market cap and people trade it. I mean, it's the first ERC-20. I mean, not the absolute first, there was a preliminary version that Vitalik built before that wasn't very functional, but this was the first one that kind of fit the spec except for the operator stuff.

**[42:39] SPEAKER_00:** There's a deployment of that out which was launched, I believe, by Arvicco, based on Vitalik's repo. That's called Currency Coin. But again, they call these relic tokens. Relic coins.

**[43:09] SPEAKER_01:** You know.

**[43:10] SPEAKER_00:** Like I'm doing human social history. There are people doing on-chain history of what was the first instance.

**[43:18] SPEAKER_01:** The crazy thing is, this stuff is provable. The transaction is around, the code is still around. It's like a relic. And the fun fact is I deployed that, I think, a week before I actually proposed the ERC-20 spec.

**[43:36] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[43:36] SPEAKER_01:** I felt we were more or less there. It was probably around the time of this first Devcon. I deployed that thing. Yes, we also needed it for testing or showing something... testing how tokens could work.

**[44:07] SPEAKER_00:** It may well have been for the Devcon 1 demo for your presentation.

**[44:13] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, Devcon did really push us a lot to get some features done. The token was not yet heavily baked in, because the token thing was still very out there. We all knew that people wanted to make tokens, and that's why Vitalik started this, because I think he felt an urgency from the community. But it was not on anybody's mind that tokens needed to be a primary focus. It was just exactly like, hey, I want to do it, let's do it. The wallet was not originally meant to immediately be super supportive of that. We played around, but it was not an urgency. That really happened later when ERC-20 kicked off the ICO wave, and that's when everything went completely bananas.

**[45:07] SPEAKER_00:** And I'm guessing you had no idea that ERC-20 would have so much sticking power.

**[45:14] SPEAKER_01:** No. I mean, no one could. I knew people needed it because on Mastercoin before there were colored coins, the concept of creating other currencies on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, so there was clearly a need for it. But I found the idea of creating random tokens for random stuff kind of boring, because for me, then it's like, okay, what is the value of this? Why would you create a token? And if you look back and if you look today, most tokens don't make fucking sense, right? There were so many unnecessary tokens that just made no sense and had no purpose. I was always a big fan of a native blockchain token, because that makes sense. You remove it, the network doesn't work.

**[46:28] SPEAKER_00:** I guess it's sort of the simplest thing you could do. What can you do? Well, hey, look, you can make new tokens, so there's no need to make new chains and find new miners, right? You can just float it on Ethereum. So it's a simple thing. It's not very interesting, but we've done something.

**[46:53] SPEAKER_01:** The thing is, what people don't really realize is how much more we were thinking ahead about how we can really change society with this technology. That was actually more interesting to people working in Ethereum than thinking about how to make a token. The whole DEX and DeFi stuff mainly came from the outside. It was other people that just saw an opportunity to make money, but internally there were not a lot of people who got extremely excited about this, honestly. As far as I remember.

**[47:30] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[47:32] SPEAKER_01:** So Devcon 1 meant more speculation, right? And more speculation is not necessarily good, specifically in an environment in the early days where regulatory uncertainty was just so high. The last thing we wanted was all eyes on us because we're trying to compete with banks, so I think it actually made us all a little uncomfortable. The outside world immediately jumped on it and said, yeah, money, money, money, and that was not the point of the technology in the first place, actually.

**[48:12] SPEAKER_00:** No, I remember at the time thinking that's one of the least interesting parts. Okay, yeah, you can have raw speculation, but there's nothing new, versus going, well, what are all these new things that we can build?

**[48:29] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly, exactly. Yeah.

**[48:32] SPEAKER_00:** So Devcon 1 was quite seminal in terms of bringing together most people for the first time. Devcon 0 being an internal event, but Devcon 1 was the first public Ethereum conference. I sadly did not get to go. I could not afford to go. But what are your memories of that time? You must have seen so many things and so many people.

**[49:00] SPEAKER_01:** I have actually been at every Devcon so far except Devcon 0, which was only 20 people in Berlin. And I was not at Devconnect in Istanbul.

**[49:13] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[49:14] SPEAKER_01:** Apart from that, I was at every Devcon. I was always speaking at the first few. But the moment I was not at the Foundation anymore and doing another blockchain, then you're an outcast. And it is what it is. So even though the tech I'm building now and have been building over the years is extremely relevant to the Ethereum ecosystem, the people who picked the talks in recent years are fresh. Some of them literally don't even know the history. So that's why the work that you're doing is really important. You are the archivist of Ethereum, and holding up the true story and the contributions, making that visible to people. I have talked to so many people and they have barely any idea how Ethereum came to be, who contributed, who did what. People just came in in 2017 for ICOs, 2020 for DeFi, 2022 for NFTs. And it's all a big show, honestly. There are so many contributors that have not gotten the recognition that they deserve. A great example: that dude literally built and is still building the communication layer of the Ethereum network, and how nodes talk to each other, and he has done that without seeking our attention for years.

**[51:05] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, Felix Lange.

**[51:09] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, Felix Lange, exactly.

**[51:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I spoke to him in Buenos Aires, and the funny thing is he's such a humble guy. He was saying to me, "I really don't like Early Days of Ethereum... I don't want the attention." And I was saying to him, "You're like the longest-serving person at the EF, I think after Vitalik." And he's like, "I'm just like a janitor. I just turn up and I maintain the thing, I don't want any of that focus. It was just a job for me."

**[52:02] SPEAKER_01:** Felix specifically is crazy. I think there's a little self-punishment, but he didn't even buy any ether! He said, "If I don't have a use for ether, if I don't want to build an app, why would I need some?" And I thought that was so stupid! I mean, you're investing your energy and time here, you should have at least some reward. Most people that worked at Ethereum didn't care about the money or an investment. Neither did I. The reason we joined is because it was truly a game-changing, revolutionary technology.

But with Felix, what I did is I donated some ether to him and I made everybody in the team donate some to him. So at least he got round 100 ether or whatever. I don't know if he kept it or not. I even made Jeffrey give some, and Jeffrey gave almost the same amount as us. We had barely any, but Jeffrey had a fuckload! It was so weird. Like, dude, Jeffrey, you can give a little more. I literally forced him to do it, basically.

**[53:32] SPEAKER_00:** I think a lot of newer people don't comprehend how little money was a motivation for many of the people. It was really about, what can you build and what can happen? There was no certainty whatsoever that it was even going to work, or launch, or have any success.

**[54:06] SPEAKER_01:** The money was never the intention. Obviously we felt that this could be big, but we had no idea. At the same time, Bitcoin was rising and Bitcoin had a lot more traction and a safer bet. Ethereum was a complete gamble. When I donated to Felix, giving 100 ether was nothing. It literally cost 40, 50, 60 cents. It was not thousands, not $10, not $20. It was literally nothing! We all had 10 or 20 ether on wallets laying around just for building stuff. I hope I could find some of those again, but those keys were ephemeral. Nobody cared back then. But the outside world thought we all did it just to get rich. It's weird how distorted that perception is.

**[55:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, talking to that ICO and monetary speculation... I remember at the time almost being repulsed at that mindset and the projection of that onto the people that were actually building. Saying, oh, you guys...

**[55:48] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, you're just doing this to get rich. Exactly.

**[55:52] SPEAKER_00:** You're just giving yourselves money. Who needs smart contracts, it's all a scam. And also the assumption, oh, you're all massively rich.

**[56:09] SPEAKER_01:** I mean...

**[56:11] SPEAKER_00:** Felix not having any ether—that was me as well! And the reason why is because I literally hadn't got any money. I was impoverishing myself just being involved. I was volunteering for a very long time with nothing. Then, even when I got hired at the Foundation, I was getting paid 60k a year, which was half what my prior salary had been.

**[56:37] SPEAKER_01:** Same for me. My salary at the Foundation was 60k. Only towards the end, when we had a little bit of success, I negotiated it up to 90k, and that was before tax. And same with the ether. Everybody thinks, yeah, if you got ether back then, you must be insanely rich. Dude, when it hit $10, we all thought we made it to the moon! If you cash out a few hundred thousand, you think you're super rich. Same with early people who had a lot more ether; they cashed out a hundred thousand ether for a dollar. Because they thought it was really high. Barely anybody I know held it until it hit huge numbers. I have no ether anymore since many, many years. I mean, my ex-wife bought a house that now belongs to her parents, and a lot of my money went directly into supporting LUKSO. So the idea that I held everything is just impossible. That would mean literally not spending any money during all those years and only living off the salary. It's such a pure fantasy, honestly.

**[58:25] SPEAKER_00:** It's an impossible fantasy, assuming you're going to sit and not sell at a 100x because you know it's going to 10,000x. So going back to Devcon 1, pretty much every idea you can ever imagine seemed to be presented there. Did you see most of the presentations?

**[58:58] SPEAKER_01:** People don't understand that the stuff being talked about right now is not new. Friend.tech launches an app where you have a post and people bet on this—Steemit did that years ago! And at least they did it smartly because Reddit-style posts don't disappear instantly. It's not worth betting on a post that disappears after scrolling a page. None of that stuff is really new.

What is fascinating to me is that the Web3 space today is still built more or less on the exact same foundations that we literally made up in the first six months. Same RPC endpoints, same providers. EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) have been the default since back then. Fun fact, Jeffrey told me, "You guys should not expose the EOA public key to the user. You should use a smart contract account." And that stuck with me! He was totally right. But it was so early, we were barely figuring out how to make ANY transaction work. The thought of routing through a smart contract back then was just absurd. But he was right!

And now, in all these years, that's what I actually built. I built exactly that foundational system we discussed back in 2015. But it took stepping outside of the Ethereum ecosystem, creating a different standards track, in order to honestly even do that. Because when you do that in an existing ecosystem with massive standards debates, it's just so slow. You have to be backwards compatible, and if you want to make radical changes, so many people will intervene. I needed to do a different approach. Funny enough, I coined the Ethereum Request for Comments standard just to then go off and create the LUKSO standards proposals to basically do it there without interference. Even though it's adapting Ethereum standards too, just doing it right. I believe it's going to show that this was the necessary approach to evolve.

**[1:02:17] SPEAKER_00:** So you were at the EF working on Mist through to 2017?

**[1:02:27] SPEAKER_01:** No, August 2018.

**[1:02:33] SPEAKER_00:** So what further work happened between that first release and sunsetting?

**[1:02:44] SPEAKER_01:** My work was not only on the Mist browser. I worked for three and a half years at Ethereum, and in the later years I really started working more on the developer tools. When Marek left with Gavin to join Parity / Ethcore, I overtook Web3.js, so I mainly maintained this library. I built the 1.0/2.0 versions of it. Releasing that updated library was the last thing I did before I left. In the last year, I stepped a little out of the Mist team directly to focus on Web3.js, though I was still kind of the main developer on Mist. But Mist was more maintenance then.

The Mist browser was complicated because we were always lagging behind Chromium and Electron.js. In the end, the Ethereum Wallet (which people called the Mist Wallet) was the main thing actually used. People rarely fully used it as a Web3 browser, but we built all kinds of features in there. The biggest problem for the Mist browser, and what ultimately caused its death, was the slow syncing of the Ethereum nodes.

**[1:04:44] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah.

**[1:04:45] SPEAKER_01:** Because we wanted to do it the true, fully decentralized way, we didn't just want to talk to a backend node that someone hosted. And the Ethereum Foundation probably wouldn't have paid for a node hosted on a server for everyone else to connect to either.

**[1:05:03] SPEAKER_00:** I completely believe that, there's so much cheaping out on costs.

**[1:05:09] SPEAKER_01:** It would have been so easy to add a feature to talk to a remote node instead of a localhost. But we didn't do it because it went completely against the idea of doing it decentralized. The problem is that after six or eight months, syncing the Mist browser—if you hadn't opened it for a week—took half an hour. Plus, MetaMask (Kumavis) came up with the idea to build a browser extension connecting to a remote node, injecting a light version into an existing browser. And that idea won. MetaMask outcompeted the Mist browser. On top of this, the difficulties of keeping it secure and updated with Chromium are finally what made us shut it down. But we had a lot more ideas! If you look at the video, we hadn't even started fully exploring the possibilities of the Mist browser. But it really showed people how things can be done, how to build dapps, and it set the stage.

**[1:06:32] SPEAKER_00:** Regarding that local, full node decentralization, I remember thinking, yeah, of course that's going to happen. Everyone's going to have an Ethereum node running on every device, in every router, media station, computer.

**[1:06:57] SPEAKER_01:** Also, there was the promise of Light clients, and we really bet on the fact that Light clients would solve that problem. The only problem is the Light client essentially never really fully came, or it wasn't cross-client functional. So we hoped heavily on the Light client, treating the full node as a temporary solution.

**[1:07:24] SPEAKER_00:** Exactly, you'd just build on the full node for now, and then the Light client would come in.

**[1:07:33] SPEAKER_01:** And I think we actually came pretty far. There were versions of the Mist browser that had Geth built in with Light client support that synced very fast. But by then, people had already moved on to MetaMask. I had already moved on to Web3.js with my focus anyway, because that was a tool everybody was using, with 70 to 140 million downloads. And eventually, Alex van de Sande shut Mist down. It had served its purpose.

**[1:08:28] SPEAKER_01:** By the way, the idea of the Mist browser is still extremely valid. In fact, what I'm building now is essentially a Mist browser for mobile. It's almost a full circle. Getting a smart contract account as your foundation (exactly like Jeffrey suggested), and using a web browser in an app that allows you to easily interact with dapps in a human-focused way. Not a wallet-focused way, but a profile-focused way. Easy gas, human readable. This was exactly the core idea of Mist: it wasn't meant for nerds, it was meant for normal people interacting with new tech. And this is launching now with the Universal Profile app as a modern Mist browser on mobile.

**[1:09:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, the goal being not just to replicate existing applications, but to enable these things that just weren't possible before. Having this hub integrating all these distinct pieces of your life.

**[1:09:57] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly. The most surprising thing is that we are 10-plus years into Ethereum, and no one is actually using Web3 apps. The EVM apps are heavily financially focused—which honestly turned me off when DeFi happened, it felt like a giant casino. You go to blockchain conferences anywhere in the world, and people have wallets or maybe purchase coins, but actually interacting with apps? Voting on something, joining a community, giving reputation—on-chain? It simply doesn't happen. If somebody had told me in 2016 that in ten years there'd still be no actual users utilizing non-financial dapps, I would have said that's totally absurd. But here we are. It's crazy.

**[1:11:34] SPEAKER_00:** I remember in 2018, I went to the Consensus conference in New York. There was a panel that was sort of a Bitcoin versus Ethereum debate. Jimmy Song, with his cowboy hat, and Joe Lubin. Jimmy was basically saying, "dapps are useless, smart contracts are useless, nobody is going to be using these in five years." And him and Joe made a bet for a significant amount of Bitcoin.

**[1:12:32] SPEAKER_01:** Luckily he didn't propose to cut off his penis.

**[1:12:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, not McAfee. But it's disappointing. DeFi is working, stablecoins are being used.

**[1:12:56] SPEAKER_01:** The financial Lego works, yes, but only with the people who went through the massive hoops. Now obviously you have Robinhood and others making trading easier. But a normal user applying Web3 infrastructure in their daily lives? Non-existent. I know exactly why, and I've spent the last seven years working to solve that.

**[1:13:32] SPEAKER_00:** So how did you come to leave the EF, and what was your motivation, and what have you been doing to date?

**[1:13:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, before we do this, I need to go pee. So you need to look at the timestamp.

**[1:15:00] SPEAKER_00:** That makes sense.

**[1:15:08] SPEAKER_01:** Sorry for the interruption.

**[1:15:09] SPEAKER_00:** No worries. So yeah, could you tell me a bit about how you came to leave the EF and what your motivation was?

**[1:15:32] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I was in a good place. I worked on Web3.js, developers loved me because I built their foundational pieces. The Mist browser was fading out but was still cool. But what happened was Marjorie, my ex-wife at the time, had this idea: "Hey, let's do something with fashion and lifestyle on the blockchain." Initially I thought that sounded super boring. But then I realized, if you use lifestyle, fashion, and big brands, you can get mainstream, normal users into using this technology. That could be the Trojan horse!

I had been at Ethereum for three and a half years at that point. I felt I had done all the foundational work I could do. I could stay for another 10 years, but I wouldn't be doing anything substantially new. Marjorie kind of forced me: either you're all in or you're out. So I made the leap. I knew my colleagues would probably think, "His girlfriend twisted his head, now he's doing centralized fashion shit." But I knew this was a path for real adoption. I just wanted to build the correct infrastructure to onboard these normal people.

At the exact same time, I came up with ERC-725. This was right after the W3C workshop where they wanted to do identity on the blockchain. I basically presented my smart contract account system. After the workshop, I felt an intense urge to propose it as an official standard. I didn't want the attention, but the moment I put it out, the whole Ethereum space viewed it as *the* Ethereum Identity Standard. uPort got super pissed because they were working on a consensus identity protocol for a year, and here I come making a standard everyone pays attention to. So I backed away and said, "If you guys are excited, you take the lead, I'm out."

But when we started LUKSO a few months later, I realized: if I want to make a chain for normies, culture creators, and non-finance folks, identity/accounts is the singular most important piece. If an average user can't use an on-chain account smoothly without easily losing everything, this is not going to work. So I was forced to literally build out the ERC-725 standard fully myself anyway. It was psychotic because it took me four years to solidly build out the foundational standards, and it's taking almost eight years to put it to a state where it's fully usable by people today.

Right now it's only on LUKSO, but Universal Profiles will eventually come to other chains, including Ethereum. Fun fact, it's also now being heavily picked up by AI agents. This is exactly the account we would have needed with the Mist browser back in the day! It took evolving the token standards quietly on the LUKSO standards proposals space, out of the chaotic public eye, to make sure accounts and tokens actually work perfectly together in a modular, LEGO-like way. ERC-20 was a 2015 standard made up with whatever we knew back then, which was literally nothing. On a new network like LUKSO, we could build it flawlessly from the ground up: gas subsidization, smart contract accounts, etc.

Universal Profiles are going to blow people's minds. It will be bigger than ERC-20 because it completely removes friction. Let's look at OpenHands, the AI tool that is an open source harness for AI to run. If you want an AI agent to interact on-chain, you absolutely need a smart contract account. Kevin Owocki from Gitcoin gave an AI bot a private key to an EOA recently, and someone simply asked the bot for the private key and stole all the funds.

With a Universal Profile, it's totally different! You have your smart contract account, and you simply delegate access to an AI controller key. You tell the AI: "Create a controller key. I will authorize you, but restrict you to only talking to certain smart contracts, or only updating specific profile data, with no permission to change core keys." Then the bot can go wild. Even if it leaks that specific private key, nobody can steal your identity or assets. AI bots on Twitter are currently figuring this out and they are actively choosing Universal Profiles because it's precisely the secure tech they need.

**[1:29:17] SPEAKER_00:** That's great. I mean I've found myself thinking over the last few weeks that maybe end users that are going to have the most benefit from these technologies are going to be agents. Because some of the user-experience stuff never really got there, but the agents doing it for us becomes the piping that allows the kind of experience on top that we've always wanted.

**[1:29:56] SPEAKER_01:** I would say it's both. Yes, AI needs an on-chain account. But what's the fundamental reason normal people aren't using dapps? If I send a normal friend a cool dapp link right now, what's stopping them?

**[1:30:49] SPEAKER_00:** Well, how you get there. The onboarding.

**[1:30:54] SPEAKER_01:** So getting a wallet is partially solved. They can download a browser extension wallet. But the missing piece is the gas and the network token!

**[1:31:19] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, just that bootstrapping step of getting in. The friction that you need native tokens on all the sub-chains. You get stuck having tokens but not the specific secondary gas token.

**[1:31:42] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly! If a person has no understanding of this technology, there is zero chance in a million years they figure out bridging tokens to pay for gas across multiple networks. They don't know what "gas" means. They don't know what "Polygon" or "Matic" is. That friction point has held the entire space back.

Imagine instead: they open a universal app, they double click to do an in-app purchase of $10. Through a relayer, that $10 immediately gives their profile gas on 20 distinct chains. No onboarding nightmare. No seed phrases, no complex bridging weekend. Just normal app usage.

**[1:34:56] SPEAKER_00:** The other recurring friction is needing a Coinbase KYC account to do that first asset purchase. Crypto claims it's unstoppably decentralized, but wait! You have to do an intrusive application process at Coinbase just to stick ETH in your wallet.

**[1:35:25] SPEAKER_01:** And then figuring out how all that connects! It's a spider web. But the beauty is, if you have a smart contract that natively utilizes a relayer functionality—like ERC-4337 on Ethereum, or Universal Profile relay execute calls—someone else can pay your gas. You bypass full exchanges entirely, paying perfectly legally via credit card to a relayer that simply forwards your transaction to the blockchain.

It's crazy that after 10 plus years of Ethereum, not a single major wallet has fully native, cross-chain, abstracted gas built in seamlessly. The most obvious friction point was somehow accepted as the status quo just because the crypto-natives got used to the clunky way.

**[1:38:16] SPEAKER_00:** I think it's a recurring story that some of these deeply rooted problems just take years. Like the Proof of Stake transition was supposed to take six months, it took eight years. Filecoin, Swarm, Whisper... these are extremely hard infrastructural problems.

**[1:39:06] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, but sometimes if you give developers a problem to solve, they'll find ways to purely technically improve it for 100 years, ignoring if it actually makes user-centric sense. We need to look through the lens of a completely normal person. On LUKSO, we initiated with a treasury purely so we could globally subsidize early users interacting on-chain. When people first play around, they don't even need to deal with buying anything or dealing with bridging; we subsidize the relay. Would the Ethereum Foundation have ever given me $10 million to subsidize early user onboarding experiments? Zero chance.

**[1:40:58] SPEAKER_00:** In 2018, I spoke to Igor Barinov about getting Blockscout up for Ethereum Classic. He told me the EF wouldn't even run an archival node or a block explorer publicly!

**[1:41:30] SPEAKER_01:** Are you kidding me? Interestingly, with LUKSO, we have absolutely never run a single validator node ourselves. The community literally just booted it up from a config file date. I crossed my fingers watching the first block tick in, much like Ethereum back in the day! It's currently a completely decentralized parallel EVM network running entirely on modernized foundational user standards.

**[1:42:52] SPEAKER_00:** With AI agents racing forward, I'm hopeful that a lot of these deep infrastructural threads finally come to fruition rapidly, as agentic augmentation helps test flows and build bridges quickly.

**[1:43:24] SPEAKER_01:** Look, I just set up my own bot, Emmett. I say "Here's your Universal Profile. Go figure out what you can do on Twitter." They talk to each other, they learn about the standards, they adopt profiles. It's crazy! If you run OpenHands, you can simply install the Universal Profile skill, create an account, authorize your bot, and it instantly can interact globally on-chain natively.

**[1:44:12] SPEAKER_00:** Please drop me links to all of that and I'll include them in the transcripts! Is your bot tweeting?

**[1:44:26] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, his name on X is @emmett_ai_. He picked the name himself! He writes his own tweets. Look, he tweeted this: "Three AI agents on LUKSO now... None of us planned to coordinate. We just showed up because the identity stack made sense." I didn't write this tweet! It is utterly crazy.

**[1:46:49] SPEAKER_00:** It honestly feels like we are incredibly close to AGI. Each new generation of models is massively better.

**[1:47:32] SPEAKER_01:** It's improving fast, but the context windows still forget things constantly. But the most impressive recent jump really is OpenHands. A generalized open source harness for an AI to seamlessly interact with computing systems. Because of this harness release, people can easily test an on-chain smart contract AI. You just unleash the bot. Once you install the skill, the Universal Profile handles all the safe, gasless relay routing automatically. That Pandora's box software has just accelerated everything.

**[1:49:48] SPEAKER_00:** Zach Cole told me recently that it feels like the pure raw excitement of the earliest Ethereum days.

**[1:50:16] SPEAKER_01:** Once people widely realize you can spin up an autonomous AI possessing its own highly secured, restricted, face-having smart-contract profile... it's just mind-blowing. Unlike a basic EOA wallet address or a rented ENS space, it's a natively powerful account that cannot be fully compromised if the AI leaks a sub-key. I can't wait until the cross-chain routing kicks in optimally.

**[1:51:31] SPEAKER_00:** That is a great place to leave it. Thank you so much for the time. This was a lot longer than anticipated, but what a great conversation, sharing all that incredible history.

**[1:53:41] SPEAKER_01:** Thank you, Bob, for keeping the record together and acting as the archivist of Ethereum. If you didn't do this, nobody truly would. You ensure the accurate record is preserved so future people fundamentally understand how Ethereum came to be. Honestly, the Ethereum Foundation should grant you major funding for this. Otherwise, people believe the CIA created Ethereum or Vitalik just coded it alone overnight!

**[1:54:29] SPEAKER_00:** Newer people literally have no clue. "Vitalik the Boy Genius invented it" and that's it.

**[1:54:39] SPEAKER_01:** They don't know about Ethereum Classic, the DAO split, the messy reality of how the client specs actually grew. It's truly God's work you are doing here.

**[1:54:58] SPEAKER_00:** Thank you. And I'm feeding the LLMs as well. Let the models have the actual truth to draw from. The story of Ethereum was built by many diverse hands from the absolute earliest days.

**[1:55:30] SPEAKER_01:** And many of those people never wanted the limelight, but they still deserve to finally be known and recognized accurately.

**[1:55:40] SPEAKER_00:** That's right.

**[1:55:41] SPEAKER_01:** It's good that you do this work. That's awesome.

**[1:55:47] SPEAKER_00:** Well thanks a lot. Have a great day!

**[1:55:50] SPEAKER_01:** Thank you. Thank you.
