**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** So hello and welcome to early days of Ethereum. I am delighted today to be joined by Fabian Vogelsteller. Is that the correct pronunciation.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_01:** Like an F? The V is more like an F. But yes.

**[00:19] SPEAKER_00:** Right, very Germanic pronunciation. That's not going to come out of my mouth. So yeah, you know, great, great to see you. We, we, we saw each other at DevConnect in November I think for the first time for, for quite a while and, and had a good catch up there. But, but hello.

**[00:44] SPEAKER_01:** So hey, yeah.

**[00:47] SPEAKER_00:** What, what, what were you doing prior? Wandering into, into blockchain world.

**[00:59] SPEAKER_01:** So okay, let's start from the beginning. Okay, so what I was doing before blockchain, I was actually a web developer. So I started out as, I mean I build websites since I was 14. My findura, the name that I have on Twitter is actually the name of the content management system that I built I think in 2005. And it just happened to be, you know, turning into my second identity. So I have two identities in the Internet. Frozen man and Pandura. It's all just connected to two things in GitHub. I'm frozen and that's also my GitHub history with Ethereum and so on. And Pandora is then my online one. Yeah, I mean I basically, you know, was always interested in the cutting edge of like the cool Internet stuff in the 90s, you know, building in the first 2000s my first websites or 1990, whatever, eight, nine, you know, following the whole evolution of the Internet with HTML CSS, HTML1 and 2 and CSS1 2 and JavaScript and coming in and blah blah blah. So mainly did web development but I studied media design so I didn't study anything with coding. All the coding is autodidactically learned, so I haven't. Yeah, there's nothing that came from, from Honestly even when I joined Ethereum I had no clue about bytes and how to manipulate bytes and stuff. Still don't have, actually I still don't know.

**[02:37] SPEAKER_00:** Didn't have your computer science background. I don't have any computer science background.

**[02:42] SPEAKER_01:** Not sure what, I don't know what I'm doing on, on the computer. I just know how to interact with like high level languages and now I only know how to speak to AI and to my team.

**[02:52] SPEAKER_00:** That's all you need. Things changed and you wrote a book.

**[03:01] SPEAKER_01:** I wrote a book about Meteor js. So I, yeah, I got really obviously into web development. I did a lot of websites and built a lot of things. I built my own content management system in PHP and I Build a flat file based content management system. So that means that this doesn't need a database. The whole idea was, okay, I just want to have one of these FTP PHP ready servers and if I want to move my. It was literally all about the independence of hosting providers. Right? If I want to move from this hosting provider to the other. I mean back in the day migrating databases was a nightmare and probably still is a nightmare. Oh yeah, it was. Oh, if I build a flat file based thing, you just copy the whole folder structure over to the other server and it works. And it did. So that was what definedura.org CMS does and did. I mean obviously who uses a PHP today but Facebook does? No, but, but I mean, yeah, now I have a bunch of haters in the PHP community, but yeah, I mean so yeah, I built that thing and that was really like helping me like to kind of like do a full project front to end. And then I got more into JavaScript and I got really excited by Meteor Jazz, which was one of the first reactive JavaScript frameworks that was before Angular, before React and it was the first time where you just could Write like this JavaScript code and, and this HTML stuff and when you update stuff in the JavaScript or in your local state, like the HTML got rerendered natively. Super magic. So I got really into this and, and I wrote a book about it. I have it here. If you ever wanna. I would never, I would never read a tutorial book to be honest. But I wrote one thing.

**[05:04] SPEAKER_00:** People even read books anymore.

**[05:06] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I mean honestly I would never even. It was so much work to do this. And the reason why I did is because they reached out to me and I thought like yeah, I could do that. And then, you know, Marjorie, my ex wife back in the day, encouraged me and I thought like okay, why not? And on the end it was a lot of work. I mean literally like four months of waking up and I had a kid, two year old, two year old kid at the time and I had to wake up very early or maybe a year old, I don't remember. And I had to wake up very early at five to you know, write one or two, three pages or five pages, whatever and then go to work. It was intense. You get an hour rel rate of like 10 cents. So it made totally no money. I literally probably made like exactly like 10 cents per hour or something like this.

**[06:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[06:02] SPEAKER_01:** But it's reputation and in a, in a way I think that also what got me into Ethereum because, because what is this writing single page apps with Meteor. And what is a D app? It's a single page app.

**[06:18] SPEAKER_00:** It's.

**[06:18] SPEAKER_01:** The whole point literally runs in your browser, doesn't require a backend. And I built actually a tool that allowed you to strip out the server part of the Meteor app so you can handle it as a local app. It's actually quite. It was quite a popular repository called Meteor Build Client. And yeah, that's what I use for dapps in the early days in Ethereum too.

**[06:46] SPEAKER_00:** Is Meteor still an active project? Is anyone using Meteors too?

**[06:52] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, no, I. I totally think so. I think so, yeah. I mean, I don't know how frequent they are. Yeah, I haven't checked it out in a long time. No.

**[07:10] SPEAKER_00:** But I mean, it was quite, quite a revolution at the time. The single page app.

**[07:15] SPEAKER_01:** It was the first, you know, it was literally like, it was one of the first. It was the first framework that I know that really was a proper framework and it's just solved the whole thing from account creation to reactive DOM updates to server client synchronization. It was magic. Yeah, it blew a lot of people away. And then all the other React and so on were kind of more like answers to this. And then React brought it back to the weird way of mixing code and UI in the same files, which I already found very bad in PHP times.

**[07:52] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[07:53] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[07:56] SPEAKER_00:** And then I guess you maybe sort of found your way into bitcoin world in some form.

**[08:02] SPEAKER_01:** So, yeah, 2013, I heard about Canadian wants to sell house in Bitcoin. And I thought, okay, wow, what's that? Like somebody's selling a house in a currency I've never heard of. And that really led me very quickly down the rabbit hole of, of this was 2013, March. That was literally when Bitcoin hit 200 in that very same month. And number one, I saw, okay, there's money to, to be made here. Um, and I, I was a student with no money. So, like, you know, trying, like, you have your hope. Okay, okay, maybe I can make a little bit of money on the side this way. But I really quickly understood the fundamental power of this technology. And it took me like about a year to really understand how it works fully. I mean, I literally had this epiphany every month that I thought, like, now I know how it works. Ah, it took me a year to really construe my brain, you know, no, no servers and frameworks, you know, and how this basic stuff works. And then the crypto blockchain stuff was just so out there in a way how this stuff works. But yeah, so I, I was in the space and then in 2000 and obviously, you know, right after I joined the bitcoin community, then there was the first altcoin Litecoin. And then in 2013 there was a lot of like projects that were created trying to imitate bitcoin or do an improvement or do alternate versions. I also got really into Master Coin, the idea of just writing onto the bitcoin blockchain rather than creating a separate blockchain.

**[09:49] SPEAKER_00:** Right. And you're in Berlin. Right. Were were you going to meetups or like, did you find Fellow.

**[09:56] SPEAKER_01:** It was just online. There were no meetups at the time, really. Like not in my region. So what actually happened in 2000? And so they were done later. 2014, there were then some meetups and so I heard about Ethereum. I really knew that. I just felt immediately that this is a really powerful approach, but it also sounded so unrealistic. So when I heard like this, this, I mean, I looked at the white paper. I never really read the Ethereum white paper actually ever fully. I just literally just like I skipped over it and I, I t. I listened to Vitalik and I. Or like the early things that were floating around and I knew this is it. The idea of making this computation machine on the blockchain makes total sense. I just thought it's so hard to do. And I'm. I didn't really give it a lot of chances of that. They pulled this off, but then they pulled it off pretty quickly and it just happened so that I was at a meetup in Berlin, a bitcoin meetup, I think the first one I was ever at.

**[10:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[10:55] SPEAKER_01:** They wanted to open a. A bitcoin center, Berlin. Co working space, basically.

**[11:04] SPEAKER_00:** Can you imagine what kind of month.

**[11:06] SPEAKER_01:** That might have been that was in. I think it was August 2024. It was literally like a week before the Ethereum presale started.

**[11:18] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[11:19] SPEAKER_01:** Like literally like days before. So I met these guys from Ethereum. In this case was Aaron, who did the accounting at the time.

**[11:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[11:29] SPEAKER_01:** And they told me that they are going to open an office in Berlin and that there's some kind of news coming out next week, but he can't tell me. And I was already following Ethereum. I wasn't already waiting for the ico. And yeah, then it happened. So I took all my bitcoin that I had at the time, which was 12 bitcoins, converted them into Ether. I mean, people think like, oh my God, 12 bitcoins but they were like 600 worth or whatever. It was like literally not much. I put them all into Ether or pretty much everything. And I knew this is going to be big. I felt it. And, and this was also the first time a project where I thought I would love to work for this project because it's not about finance, money and wallets because every bitcoin startup at the time was just about creating a wallet and I was really interested in creating wallets. And so it just happened that the same like six months later, you know, bitcoin happened, ICO happened, attention came, blah, blah, blah. I just got an email from a recruiter saying the company Ethereum is looking for a C developer and I was not a C developer. Recruiters don't check anything on LinkedIn, I guess or GitHub. But I knew that they're now looking. So I went to their office and I just chatted with Aaron again and I saw that this office here, Waldemar Strasse and I realized that okay, actually they really just thinking that they're going to build the nodes and then like people will build on top of the stack. And I just knew, you know, like I know how to build single apps. This, this is what you need. I knew this is what they will need to make sure to show what a D app can, can be and show how to. I just felt it and so I said like Aaron just, just can. I mean I showed him this as well and just ask around internally. And they had one Skype group that was kind of like the Discord group at the time. Yeah, and funny enough, Alex van der Sande is the one who came on board as the UX designer also just a month before me. And he had this whole idea of creating this Mist browser concept and I think when Alex heard about that there's this guy that came up here that can build single page apps, then Alex thought, oh, that could be the person who can help with building the Mist browser. So he convinced Jeff, I mean that's my assumption what happened? And, and he tried to call me up and I was in, in Turkey on holiday. So I didn't pick up the phone. And then when I came back I saw someone, he called me up and somehow I think I called him back or whatever and yeah, I said, hey, you want to work here? We want, like want to do this and this and, and this was Aaron.

**[14:28] SPEAKER_00:** That you were talking to again?

**[14:30] SPEAKER_01:** No, this was Alexa. Yeah, so I was talking to afsa. So, so AFSA wanted to have me because he, he, I think he, he probably convinced Jeff because he saw this as a guy who can help build his idea. Right. And Jeffrey was kind of skeptical of hiring anyone. There's not a co developer. What the can you do, I guess is what he thought probably watch JavaScript cannot work.

**[14:58] SPEAKER_00:** So I mean you started in, in was. I think it was January 2015. So I guess this discussion would have been in like December 2014.

**[15:08] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly. Yeah, yeah, it was mid of December, I was on holidays. He tried to call me and yeah, he said, hey, can you start and ask, you know when to start? He said, yeah, start in January. And Jeffrey obviously really wanted to prove me, so he thought, okay, let me just throw a really complicated task at him and then we'll fail anyway and we can get over with this whole thing. I think that's what Jeffrey thought. So he said, okay. Build a chat app for the Whisper protocol. So in Ethereum There was the Web3, right. The idea of Web3 was the network storage, the swarm storage and communication, the Whisper. Which by the way I only figured out later that Web three means exactly these three things. Fun fact, I always thought it's like, sure, Web two, we go to Web three. But that was actually the three, probably both.

**[15:56] SPEAKER_00:** Right. It's, it's kind of a bit of a bit of a joke that you've got, you've got both. And I was just looking. So it was November that Alex had done his, you know, missed concept presentation. So I guess that was really quite fresh. It's like, okay.

**[16:15] SPEAKER_01:** So he had the idea and then they were working on it already early December and I forgot his name. But the guy who, who the French guy who then worked on Remix. I'm sorry, I forgot.

**[16:28] SPEAKER_00:** Jan Laborer.

**[16:30] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly. So Jan actually built, he built an early version of the Mist browser, but in I think in C or something like this and browser, I think there.

**[16:42] SPEAKER_00:** Was one called fbrowser.

**[16:43] SPEAKER_01:** Maybe it was really early, early kind of missed. It was barely working and obviously the whole idea connection stuff was not figured out properly yet. And they just really realized quickly that this is not the way to go. And, and that's why maybe Alex saw an opportunity here with this JavaScript dude showing up with the single page app book or whatever.

**[17:04] SPEAKER_00:** You'd had Aleph0 as well, right? I guess that was the very first GUI thing. Maybe that's what you were thinking of with Yan.

**[17:13] SPEAKER_01:** Maybe Alice 0 was the was and.

**[17:15] SPEAKER_00:** That was like a really like really ugly programmer tool. Kind of like million control.

**[17:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think Alice Zero was that early Ms. Browser. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so. So Jeffrey said, hey, let the guy build a chat app in the Whisper protocol. I got dropped into this novel tech, no documentation, no idea how the shit works, and I was supposed to build a whole chat app using this protocol and that was crazy. But because I really knew how to build single page apps that are reactive and I could work with Jan actually on, you know, he gave me just the endpoints that I need to use to get the account and to do the sending the messages and stuff like this, I pulled it off and built like a chat app. And the first time we met in March or April, all together on Amsterdam, we all use the Whisper chat app to talk to each other. Encrypted chat messaging, including groups, including. I added topics. So in a channel you could basically say, I want to talk about a certain topic. And then you could filter by the topic so you could see all messages or you could say, I want to only see this or that topic. And it's the same like threads in Discord, by the way. So I basically made the thread concept of Discord in this tiny app and it worked. And you were connected with your wallet, you know, that was in your node, in your guest stored. And I think, you know, Jeffrey was quite impressed and that kind of gave him some confidence that I can do it. Even though he was trying to, you.

**[18:56] SPEAKER_00:** Know.

**[18:59] SPEAKER_01:** Prove me wrong or prove himself right. That's not going to work. And what's crazy is we literally built the Mist browser in like three months. We built the first working version and we released it with the mainnet. We released the Ethereum wallet that was July 31, 2015. So basically, six months later, seven months later, we released the first Mist browser version. And it was so crazy because everything needed to be figured out. I needed to learn all how this stuff works. And initially, in the first two months, it felt literally impossible. And I felt like, there's no way I'm going to figure this shit out. Like, there's no way. There was no documentation. It was completely over my head in terms of complexity and shit that I didn't understand at all. But I pulled it off and, and I had to, like, obviously there were people around me that I could talk to, but everybody was also so busy and had to like figure out their own thing, you know, because everything had to be figured out at the time, but I had to literally touch every point. I had to work with the RPC API. And then I saw this thing was kind of messy. Sometimes it was returning hex sometimes it was not returning. So I had to basically I thought I'm a Virgo. So I immediately tried to
