SPEAKER_00: So, hello.

SPEAKER_01: Hello, Bob.

SPEAKER_00: So, yes, I'm Bob Summerwill, recording here at DevCon Prague for Early Days of Ethereum. And I have here Jakob. We've known each other about three years or so now, I think.

We did meet in Bogota for DevCon 6 for the first time where you introduced yourself. That was a really memorable conference.

SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, thank you for the intro and good question. It was in Bogota. I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then.

But yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about Florian Glatz, maybe, and talking about the old days. And I just jumped in because I know Florian.

SPEAKER_00: I think it was like maybe August to December.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that sounds right. It was a great time. We were all just starting out, and it was really exciting to see how things were evolving.

**[09:17] UNKNOWN:**

SPEAKER_01: It was a really formative period for the Ethereum community. Lots of new projects were starting, and there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm.

**[11:08] UNKNOWN:**

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was a great time to be involved. I remember we had some really interesting discussions about the future of decentralized applications and where Ethereum could go.

SPEAKER_00:

SPEAKER_01: It was also a time when we were starting to see some of the early challenges and issues that would need to be addressed, like scalability and security.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, those were definitely important topics. I remember we talked a lot about potential solutions and how to move forward.

SPEAKER_01: Absolutely. It was a time of a lot of experimentation and learning. We were all trying to figure out the best way to build and deploy these new technologies.

**[16:33] UNKNOWN:**

SPEAKER_01: It was also a period of a lot of collaboration. People were really willing to share ideas and work together to solve problems.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the community was really supportive. It was great to see so many people coming together to push the technology forward.

SPEAKER_01: It was definitely a special time. I think we all felt like we were part of something really big and important.
