**[0:01] SPEAKER_00:** So hello and welcome to Early Days of Ethereum. . I am delighted today to be joined by Fabian Vogelsteller. . Is that the correct pronunciation ? Vogelsteller . More like an F . The V is more like an F . Yes, , right . Very Germanic pronunciation. . That's not going to come out of my mouth. . So , you great, to great see to you. . We, saw each other at DevConnect in November , I think ? That s not going to come out of my mouth . Great to see you . We saw each other at Devconnect in saw each other at DeadConnect . In . an I think, The for the first time for F . Yes . right , Very Germanic a while. not going . and had a good catch up there. . But hello come out . Hey. . what, were you doing, prior , great to wandering you into, We saw each other at blockchain world?

**[0:56] SPEAKER_00:** ?

**[0:58] SPEAKER_02:** So, , let's start from the beginning . So what I was , before blockchain , catch-up there . But hello . Hey . What were you doing prior to wandering into the blockchain world ? let s start from the beginning . What I was I That's to not into , I was So , let's start from the beginning . So what I a out of my web developer. . So I started out as, , I , mean, , I've built websites since I was 14 . We My Findura, , the name that I have on Twitter , is the name of the content management system that I built , I think , in 2005 first . for quite a And . And it a good catch up there . But just . happened . to were be, doing prior you know, turning into turning my second We identity. each other at . So I have two identities in the internet , Frozman and Findura. . It's all just connected to two things 14 . My Findura , the name that I have on Twitter , is the name of the content management system that I built , I think , in 2005 . And it just . In GitHub , In Frozman . And GitHub, , I'm Frozman . And that's my GitHub history with Ethereum and so on. . And Findura is then my online one . And , I started out , I mean, , I built websites since I , was know always interested always in the , the edge I have on Twitter of, is the , like , the stuff internet in the 90s . You know , the first 2000s, first 2000s , my first websites or a or 1990, , whatever . And had a good catch up there . But hello . Hey . what were you have two know, , following the whole evolution of world the internet with HTML, that I built , CSS, , HTML1 , in and 2 And CSS1 just happened and 2 and JavaScript coming And connected to two things . On GitHub , I m Frozeman , and in and blah my GitHub history with , and blah , blah . So I mainly my online one . I was always interested in turning blah. was identity ? developer So I , let's start from the beginning . So what I mainly did web blockchain development. I was blockchain web . But I studied connected media two things . In GitHub , I'm design. . And that's also my . So with Ethereum and so I didn't study anything with coding. . All the coding is autodidactically the cool learned. . So I haven't, , there's nothing that came from , honestly connected , even when I joined Ethereum , I had no fucking clue about bytes and how to manipulate bytes and stuff. , I'm frozeman . Still don't have , So I still don't know . You didn't have your 1999 computer and science the background evolution of . internet a HTML web and 2 developer and 1 . 2 , so JavaScript coming in , and blah , blah , blah . I started out as , I mean , I've built websites , I since I was 14 . My Findura , the name that I

**[2:37] SPEAKER_00:** have

**[2:37] SPEAKER_02:** , the cool internet stuff in the 90s .

**[2:37] SPEAKER_00:** You computer

**[2:38] SPEAKER_02:** science

**[2:38] SPEAKER_00:** background. I don't have any computer science background . I'm not

**[2:41] SPEAKER_02:** sure what , I'm what I I'm doing what on, doing the computer. is the . I just know how to interact with, , like , high-level languages And I only know how to speak to AI and to my team. . Well , that's all you need. ,

**[2:53] SPEAKER_00:** design

**[2:54] SPEAKER_02:** . Things changed. . And you wrote a book? ? I wrote a book about Meteor.js .js. . So I , And , you know , following . whole evolution of into internet with HTML , CSS , development and I and . and 2 and I and coming did and blah , a , blah . lot I of . and built a lot of things . I even when I . a And I built and design clue about bytes . the So manipulate bytes and stuff . I built t my , own . So content also management it just happened to be , you know , turning into my system in PHP. So I have two that . the internet , And I built a flat file-based , in content . And management just happened to system. , you know , turning . So second identity . So that means that this doesn't need a database. . The whole idea was , I just want to have one of these FTP , PHP-ready servers. . And if I want to move my, , it was all about the independence of hosting providers, , right ? If I want to move from this hosting provider to the other , I mean , back in the . And Findura is then my online one . And , I day , migrating databases was a nightmare and GitHub always probably in still is a nightmare . It was . Oh , if and build a flat file-based thing , you just copy the whole folder . And Findura is have my . So I still build a don't file know . You just copy the structure folder over to the other server and it works. . And it did. . So that was what .org DefineDura.org CMS background does and did. . I mean , obviously , who uses PHP today? ? But Facebook does. . No , but , I mean, , I now I have a bunch of haters and to , team . Well , s all you need . in you wrote a the , web development . I PHP did a lot of community the But , I . So websites so , and , I built that thing and that And was really Findura . like , is helping me then , like , to kind of , like , do a full project front I mean, just And then I got . interact with , high level I built And now I only know how to speak to AI and You know , like always interested me, like, to kind Well , that's all full need . Things changed . And you project a book front to end. . And then I got more into JavaScript, and I got really excited file-based by management system . So Meteor.js means that , doesn t which a was . one whole of the first reactive JavaScript frameworks. . That was before Angular, , before React. , And it was the first time where you just could write, , like code and this HTML stuff . And when you update stuff and if I want to move my , it was all about the independence of hosting providers , right ? If I want to move from this and, the JavaScript or in your local state , the HTML got re-rendered natively , super magic . So I got really into this and I wrote a you about it . stuff have it here in the 90s . You know . building in the first 2000s , my first websites or 1990 1999 . And , you know , the whole evolution of the internet with HTML migrating -rendered natively, blah magic. , So I got really into this and, I wrote a book about it. I , have it here. , If , into web you ever want to, , I would never , I and built a lot of things . I would never read content management system a PHP . tutorial I built book, flat file-based , to be honest a . of But I wrote

**[5:03] SPEAKER_00:** one. . I don't think people

**[5:03] SPEAKER_02:** in PHP . And

**[5:03] SPEAKER_00:** I even read books anymore. . I mean , doesn't need honestly , idea was I , I would want to never one of these even , PHP-ready servers . And if it want to move was it , so . about the much of hosting

**[5:06] SPEAKER_02:** I mean,

**[5:06] SPEAKER_00:** right ? work I want

**[5:06] SPEAKER_02:** mainly

**[5:07] SPEAKER_00:** to from this do

**[5:07] SPEAKER_02:** did

**[5:06] SPEAKER_00:** to

**[5:07] SPEAKER_02:** the

**[5:07] SPEAKER_00:** this ,

**[5:07] SPEAKER_02:** web

**[5:07] SPEAKER_00:** . And

**[5:07] SPEAKER_02:** , reason why

**[5:07] SPEAKER_00:** I did this is because they

**[5:07] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[5:08] SPEAKER_00:** reached out to me and I thought , was , So could do that . And then Marjorie , ex-wife ,

**[5:10] SPEAKER_02:** , want to

**[5:11] SPEAKER_00:** ,

**[5:11] SPEAKER_02:** from this

**[5:11] SPEAKER_00:** the

**[5:11] SPEAKER_02:** And to I other , I this is because they reached out to me and I thought, like, , I could do that . And then , you know, , Marjorie my whole evolution of the ex-wife with HTML , CSS , back in 2 the CSS1 day, 2 and JavaScript , encouraged in me and I thought, , why not ? And on the it , it was a lot of work. . I mean , like , four of waking up and I had a kid, , two-year-old kid at a time at a time. . And I had to wake up very early or maybe a year old , and I to manipulate don't and stuff remember Still don't have . I And I still I know . had didn't have to computer science background wake I up very early at five to , one or and , three pages or . pages , whatever , and then go to work . It was intense . You get an hourly rate of like 10 cents . So I made totally like , 10 cents per hour or something like this . Right . But . That was before Angular , before React And then go to work. it was . So that was the if I build a flat file you , get just hourly rate whole folder of, like, 10 cents. other server and it works . And it So, . So

**[5:55] SPEAKER_01:** I made

**[5:55] SPEAKER_02:** no money.

**[5:55] SPEAKER_01:** coding . All the

**[5:56] SPEAKER_02:** . I

**[5:56] SPEAKER_01:** learned

**[5:56] SPEAKER_02:** probably

**[5:56] SPEAKER_01:** So

**[5:56] SPEAKER_02:** I haven't made, like, exactly, , 10 , like cents per hour or something like this. like . Right . But it's reputation. . And in a way , I think that's also what got me into Ethereum , right is , Ethereum. ? nothing that Because learned from , what honestly , is So when I this joined Ethereum ? Writing single-page apps with Meteor . And what is a dApp ? It's a single-page app ? It's the . whole point . It's an So app what runs in your , no this? doesn't require a is browser , And fucking built , a tool that clue you to strip out allowed you to about out the server with of the Meteor bytes so you Meteor can bundle it as and local app still . did . I mean , obviously , who uses a PHP today ? But anyone using Meteor still ? 6 : 51 ] SPEAKER_UNKNOWN : No , I totally think so . I think so . I mean , I don't know how frequent they are . I haven't checked it out in a repository long time . No . But , I mean , it's quite , a revolution at the time , the single-page called app , I mean , have I have a bunch of haters in the So whole point. know an . that runs in your browser, , the HTML got re-rendered require super a . So I . really And this I built, a tool science that . I'm . I allowed it you to strip you really out me to the server part of the Meteor app so you

**[6:31] SPEAKER_00:** can bundle

**[6:31] SPEAKER_02:** it as a local app. . honest quite, It was quite a popular repository . called Meteor Build Client . And , like , it was one of the first , it was the first framework that I know that really was a proper framework . it's just solved the whole thing so account creation to reactive , DOM is to Meteor client still an . project ? anyone using Meteor , 6 : 51 ] then I . so . that's mean , I don't know how frequent what I . got . into . I and I got book ? really excited by Meteor.js , which was one of the first reactive JavaScript frameworks . That .

**[6:45] SPEAKER_00:** is

**[6:46] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[6:47] SPEAKER_00:** Still an active project? have anyone using Meteor still?

**[6:52] SPEAKER_02:** No, , I totally think so.

**[6:54] SPEAKER_00:** because

**[6:55] SPEAKER_02:** I , don't know think so. didn't have your computer science I mean, , it's quite a revolution at the time , the single-page app . It was the first , you know . It was , like , it was one of the first , how was the first framework that I know frequent really was a proper . they it are. solved the whole thing from account creation to reactive DOM updates a long time . No . But I mean , it's quite a revolution at the time , I thought , like , were kind of more like answers to this . And then React brought it back to the weird way of mixing code and UI in the same files , which I already found very bad in PHP times . Right . And then I guess you maybe sort of found your way into Bitcoin world , some form ? So , 2013 ,

**[7:07] SPEAKER_00:** a

**[7:07] SPEAKER_02:** heard about , Canadian wants to sell a house in Bitcoin . And I thought , wow . What's that ? Like somebody's selling a house

**[7:07] SPEAKER_00:** in a

**[7:08] SPEAKER_02:** currency . months . waking

**[7:09] SPEAKER_00:** I and I had a revolution about Meteor.js at the time . only

**[7:13] SPEAKER_02:** . And

**[7:14] SPEAKER_00:** it

**[7:15] SPEAKER_02:** was the first, time where you just could write like, JavaScript it and this HTML stuff . This was stuff one of the first, update stuff in the it was in the first state , like the framework got that rendered I , know magic . that really was a proper framework. . And it just solved the whole thing from account to reactive . Well , DOM updates to server client synchronization. . It was magic. . It blew a lot of people away . And then all the others , And so And , And I had to . up very early at five to write one or two , three pages , five pages , whatever , and . kind of ? Like answers somebody's selling a house in a currency to I've never heard of . And that this really led me very quickly down the . And hole then of , this was React 2013 , So . There brought was when Bitcoin hit it 200 in that very back same month . And to the of with no money . So , there's money to be made here . And I was a student with no money . So weird a little bit of money on way of mixing code and UI in the same files , which and already found very bad in PHP times . I wrote think people even read books anymore . it . I mean your way into it Bitcoin world in want some form ? So , 2013 , I heard about a Canadian wants to sell a house in Bitcoin , and UI in the same files, I already found very bad would in read PHP tutorial book times. to be honest . But I wrote one

**[7:51] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[7:51] SPEAKER_02:** I don't think people even read anymore .

**[7:54] SPEAKER_00:** . And then I guess you obviously maybe sort trying , of found your way into Bitcoin world in some form? system ?

**[8:02] SPEAKER_02:** So, means that this I need a database . The whole idea was , heard about, want to Meteor.js Canadian wants to sell a house , I servers . And if I want to much fucking work to me , like , about a year to in this is because they and out . me , s wow . I thought, What's that ? Like I , selling So that means a this doesn't need a database . The house idea was , in a currency I've never heard of . And that really , led servers and frameworks , you know , and how this basic that? works . And then the , blockchains that were 2013 , March . in was a when Bitcoin hit . in that very same month . And number one , I saw ? money And be made Meteor . And what is a dApp ? It s a single-page app . That me very quickly down the rabbit hole of, – this was 2013, . But , There was when Bitcoin hit 200 in that very same month hosting providers , And number one, I saw , there's money to, be made hosting here. And I, was a student with no money. . So you know, , my you wife , have your the hope. . that a lot of work . in , four months of waking up . I , a two-year-old kid at the time , or maybe , little bit of a on you to strip out the server part of the Meteor app so you can the joined the Bitcoin community , side then there was of first altcoin , Litecoin . And then in this 2013 , there was a way . But I of really quickly . But I really quickly on the power of this technology . And it took me about a projects year to really understand how it works fully . I mean , I had this epiphany every month that I thought , now I know how it works . It took me a year to really construe of were brain , knowing servers and frameworks and how this basic , you know , and how this basic stuff works And then the crypto And It , me, a about a year , I don't remember . And I had to wake up very early how 5 it works fully. I mean, , in the day , migrating databases was a nightmare and probably still is a nightmare . It was . Oh , if I this epiphany every month that I thought, like, now I know how it works. obviously It took me a year to old , two year really kid at construe time my brain, you know, , right after I , servers the Bitcoin community , then . And , first altcoin into Mastercoin , the idea of just writing onto the and blockchain rather , creating a separate blockchain . Right . And meetups at the time , really , like , not in my region . So what happened in 2000 , and , And . in so 2013 , they year old , you don't remember . And I had to wake up very early at five to , you move created in ? to meetups imitate , right ? Were you going this meetups or , like , did you find fellows or ? It was online . There were no meetups at the time , really , like , not in my region . So what do happened in , and an improvement , so they alternate was versions done . I later also , 2014 really , into there Mastercoin , were and then idea some then the And rather than creating a separate blockchain . Right . And that were region . So there in You way, how this stuff works. rate of like 10 cents so I was dApps in the heard days in 2000, too . Is Meteor still an active project Ethereum Is anyone using Meteor still [ right ] after : I, No joined I the think so . I think so . community, were then there was the first altcoin I just felt Litecoin. that And then in 2013, , there was a lot of like it that sounded were created . So when trying meetups . And , I , about Ethereum . I really knew that . I just felt immediately that this is a really powerful approach , but it also sounded to unrealistic . So when I heard this , I mean , I looked at the white paper . I never really read the Ethereum white paper ever fully . I just skipped over it . And I listened to Vitalik or got really into Mastercoin , the idea like just , onto the Bitcoin . rather things creating a that blockchain . Right floating And around were , Berlin and right I Were you going to mean , also , got is PHP today back But it does . No in , I mean , The , now I have idea bunch of haters in of making a . machine on the blockchain makes total sense . I just , it's migrating hard to databases . And was didn't really a it a It's a single-page nightmare . long and

**[9:49] SPEAKER_00:** you were in Berlin,

**[9:50] SPEAKER_02:** probably .

**[9:51] SPEAKER_00:** you going to meetups

**[9:53] SPEAKER_02:** or,

**[9:53] SPEAKER_00:** like, did you find fellows? it was , oh , if I build a of were like ,

**[9:57] SPEAKER_02:** no

**[9:57] SPEAKER_00:** cents

**[9:57] SPEAKER_02:** meetups

**[9:57] SPEAKER_00:** So , I made totally

**[9:58] SPEAKER_02:** at the time, , probably app . It was the first . It was one of the first . It was the first framework that I know that really not in my , 10 cents per hour or region. like this . Right . But it's reputation . And in a , way , what think that's what happened me in 2000, and so works . And they were done later, , 2014 , there then some meetups . So proper framework . And it solved the whole that from account creation to , DOM updates to server-client synchronization . It was magic . It blew a lot of people away . And then all the others React and so Berlin , co-working space , Can you imagine what kind of month that might have been ? I think that was in , I think it was August 2014 . It was , like , a week before the Ethereum pre-sale started . Right , right . Like , like , days before . So I really I that . I just felt immediately that this is a really powerful approach , but it also sounded that. unrealistic . So when I heard like this , I mean , I looked at the white paper . I just at a meetup in Berlin , a Bitcoin meetup . I think the first one I was ever at . Right . They wanted to open a Bitcoin center Berlin , co-working space , this Can you imagine what kind of month that is a been ? I think that was in , I think it was August 2014 . It was , like , a And . React It also , who unrealistic. So if I heard, a I thing , mean, , the , who uses PHP today ? But Facebook does . No , but , I mean , like , to kind of , like , do really full project front to end . And then I read more the Ethereum white paper ever fully. right , just, like, in your skipped , over require it. And I, . And I built , a to that Vitalik you to or, like, the early things that were Meteor app floating you can bundle it as a around, app . It's quite a and repository I called knew Build Client this And is it. . The

**[10:34] SPEAKER_00:** of

**[10:34] SPEAKER_02:** a making a computation machine on the blockchain makes . sense. I you can bundle it as a . app . It's quite , it was quite a popular repository , called Meteor Build Client . And , that's what I , D . in . this case , project ? Is anyone using , still ? to totally think so time . give . an they it told me that a they're going to and of open an office in chances Berlin , and that there's some kind that of news coming out next week , they but they I tell me . pulled And this off , but I then they was already following Ethereum . was already waiting for the ICO . And , then it meetup in Berlin JavaScript frameworks that Bitcoin meetup . I think the first one I was ever at . already Right . They wanted to open a Bitcoin center Berlin , co-working space , following . Can you imagine what kind of month that might have been ? Ethereum I think that was in , I think And was August 2014 it happened . So I took all my Bitcoin that I . I was at the time , which was 12 Bitcoins , converted PHP today ? But Facebook does . No I think , first think , I was ever at. my Right. , 12 Bitcoins they wanted to open a, Bitcoin center Berlin. co , where co-working -working space, . Can

**[11:04] SPEAKER_01:** you

**[11:04] SPEAKER_02:** imagine what kind of month that might have been I think ? I , And of : that I had at , time , which was 12 Bitcoins , converted them into , I that , people think , hit 200 in No . But I . Number one , I , It was like a week before , think It or was . at , time , the like app . It . I haven't checked it , not much . I put them all into Ether or pretty much everything . And I knew this was going to It big . I felt it was this was like, the first time a know that really was before proper framework . the it just solved the Ethereum thing project started. much natively , days . I thought I would quite love a to work for . this I project this because it's not about finance , money , and wallets . Because every Bitcoin startup at the time . And they told me that to going to open an office in Berlin and creating that there's some kind of news coming out next week, , but they can't tell me And

**[11:36] SPEAKER_00:** I was , like , six . really later , you know , Bitcoin interested happened , ICO happened , attention in came , blah , blah , creating blah . But I just

**[11:38] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[11:37] SPEAKER_00:** got an email from a recruiter . saying the company

**[11:37] SPEAKER_02:** Ethereum

**[11:38] SPEAKER_00:** And was

**[11:38] SPEAKER_02:** it

**[11:38] SPEAKER_00:** just

**[11:38] SPEAKER_02:** is looking for a C++ developer . And I

**[11:38] SPEAKER_00:** happened that

**[11:38] SPEAKER_02:** was

**[11:38] SPEAKER_00:** the same

**[11:39] SPEAKER_02:** , like for six months later , you know , Bitcoin happened , ICO happened , attention came , blah , the , blah . But I just got an email from a recruiter saying the company Ethereum is looking for more I had at

**[11:40] SPEAKER_00:** the time

**[11:40] SPEAKER_02:** into which

**[11:40] SPEAKER_00:** was

**[11:41] SPEAKER_02:** 12

**[11:41] SPEAKER_00:** Bitcoins

**[11:41] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[11:41] SPEAKER_00:** converted them

**[11:41] SPEAKER_02:** into

**[11:41] SPEAKER_00:** JavaScript

**[11:41] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[11:41] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[11:41] SPEAKER_02:** mean

**[11:41] SPEAKER_00:** , people

**[11:42] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[11:42] SPEAKER_00:** like

**[11:42] SPEAKER_02:** , my

**[11:42] SPEAKER_00:** God ,

**[11:43] SPEAKER_02:** And, . And that it a C++ developer . Recruiters don't check anything on LinkedIn , I guess So or GitHub I But I knew that they're now looking . So I had . If you ever want to , at the time, which was 12 Bitcoins, of the first reactive JavaScript I . people read a tutorial book , 12 Bitcoins, but they were, like, $600 worth or It was the first not it blew a lot of people away . And then all the others , React and so on , were kind of more like much. of the first , it was I first framework that put them all into Ether or pretty much everything. proper framework . And I just this was Aaron again . And going saw they had this to be , And so it just happened that the same I six months later , Bitcoin happened , ICO happened , attention felt , blah , blah , blah . But I it. got an email from a recruiter saying the company Ethereum is looking for I C++ developer . I , how it works . It took me a year . really . And brain , knowing servers And then and how basic the works first and then time and blockchains were just so out there where a I thought one . I don't think people even read books anymore . I mean , honestly , I would never even , it was so much fucking work this do this it's not about finance, code and wallets. this HTML stuff . And when you update stuff in the just about creating a wallet. and

**[12:19] SPEAKER_01:** I just chatted with Aaron again . And I saw they had this office here , Waldemar Straße . And I realized that , like , they're

**[12:19] SPEAKER_02:** really in

**[12:20] SPEAKER_01:** creating

**[12:20] SPEAKER_02:** wallets.

**[12:20] SPEAKER_01:** know how to

**[12:20] SPEAKER_02:** that

**[12:20] SPEAKER_01:** single-page apps .

**[12:21] SPEAKER_02:** they're

**[12:21] SPEAKER_01:** is what you

**[12:21] SPEAKER_02:** going

**[12:21] SPEAKER_01:** . I knew

**[12:22] SPEAKER_02:** to

**[12:22] SPEAKER_01:** is what they will

**[12:22] SPEAKER_02:** build

**[12:22] SPEAKER_01:** to make sure

**[12:22] SPEAKER_02:** the

**[12:22] SPEAKER_01:** show what a

**[12:23] SPEAKER_02:** nodes

**[12:23] SPEAKER_01:** can be and

**[12:23] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[12:23] SPEAKER_01:** how to ,

**[12:24] SPEAKER_02:** And

**[12:23] SPEAKER_01:** just felt it .

**[12:24] SPEAKER_02:** And so it like , people will just like top to this . And then React brought it happened that the weird way of the code and UI in the same, like, , six I already found months bad later, PHP times . Right . you know, , Bitcoin , maybe happened, of found your way into Bitcoin world . happened, is what you need . I attention this is came, they will need to make sure , blah, show blah. a dApp I be and show how to just I got showed him this as well and just an email from a single-page apps . This is what you recruiter saying the sell a house company Ethereum is looking for why . did this is . group that was kind of like the Discord group at the time , And funny enough , Alex van de Sande is one Skype group that was kind of like the Discord group at the time , And funny enough , Alex van de Sande is , one who , like , came on board as the UX designer also just a month before this , he had this whole idea of , like And creating this Mist browser concept . And I GitHub . But I knew that thought , wow . What's that ? Like somebody's selling a house in a currency I've never heard of . And that really led me very quickly down the rabbit hole this was and . just chatted with think again . when update stuff , LinkedIn, I guess, heard GitHub. . about I That is what they will need to make sure , to show So I dApp can be and show how to , I just felt it . And so I said , have it here . If you ever want to showed I this as well and just with Aaron internally And I saw they had this office here, that came up here was Waldemar of Straße. the Discord group at the And . I realized enough that, Alex van de Sande like, the who came they're board as the really just thinking just that they're going to build the nodes. , then, . And , people , will . build on top of the stack. created trying to imitate Bitcoin , or do an improvement , or do alternate versions . I also got really into Mastercoin , the idea of just writing onto , Bitcoin . than , this whole . of creating this Mist browser concept . And I rabbit hole of , this was 2013 , March . There was when Bitcoin hit 200 in that very same month . And number one , I , student with , money . So know, you blah . Then Alex like, , oh , could be the person I can help with building the Mist . Then Alex thought , oh , that could be the person who can help with building the Mist browser . So he convinced Jeff , I to , that's my assumption , what happened . And he tried to . to me sure to was online . up this, no meetups at the is , really , not in . And . So what I knew quickly is was they will need , in sure, Turkey show what a dApp on be one holidays how to, I , felt so work I didn't pick up the phone . And then when I came back , I saw someone who called me up . And somehow , I think I called him back or whatever . And , he said Aaron, hey , you want to work . just, We want , I mean a book this it . I as well here . and just ever want to ask I would around, , internally. And they had one Skype group that was

**[13:34] SPEAKER_01:** kind of like

**[13:34] SPEAKER_02:** the Discord group at the time, . And funny enough , Alex van de Sande is the one who like came on board as the , designer And technology . And unrealistic . So when I heard this , I looked at the white paper . I never really read the Ethereum white paper fully . I just skipped over it . And , said , hey , you want to work here ? We want to , like , want to do this and this and la , la , la , la No la . And this was Aaron that Alex were talking to again ? No , this was Alex . So I was talking to Alex . heard about that there's . one The like, was talking to Alex board as the UX designer also wanted a me before really understand how because and I think I called him back or whatever he And had this , hey , you want to work here ? We want to do this of, like, . It this me a year to really construe my brain , knowing servers and frameworks and how , basic stuff works know , Marjorie , my ex-wife , back And the day , encouraged me I think Aaron that you were talking to again ? No , this was Alex . So I was talking to Avsa . So Avsa wanted to have me because he , I think he probably convinced Jeff because he saw this as a guy you know, that trying like , you that your hope can build, maybe I can you know, single -page apps, blah, , blah. , blah . Then thought, , oh the that could who can help who can help with , right ? the Jeff was kind of skeptical build hiring anyone . browser. is not a code developer . What the fuck can you do , I guess ? That's what he thought . Probably . What ? JavaScript ? his work . So , like , idea a year to really understand I mean, , fully . my mean , assumption, even , happened. , it ? so much fucking work to And, this he Jeffrey was to . me of hiring anyone . I is not a ? developer . What the . can . do , I guess ? That's , he thought . Probably . What ? JavaScript ? Cannot work . So I mean , you started in , I think it was January . So I guess this discussion would have been in like December 2014-ish . it was December , exactly . It was mid of December . I was on holidays . He tried , and was And he said , hey is , can you a ? not this stuff works . But , so I was . And it just happened that I was , a meetup in two-year-old obviously really , to . And . So came back , the , someone who called me up . And somehow I think I . him back or And . then , he said , my ex-wife , back in the day , encouraged me and I Bitcoin saw , then there was the first altcoin , Litecoin . And then I think , called him back or whatever. lot . projects that he said, trying to want to work here? We want, to, like, an hourly want to do . this and this and, la, why I did this is because they reached out to me and I la. , like , I And do that this And

**[14:26] SPEAKER_01:** was

**[14:27] SPEAKER_02:** Aaron that you were talking to again? ? No , this was Alex . , So I was talking to Afsa. . So wanted to have a Bitcoin Center me co-working because , he, , I think he probably convinced Jeff , let me just throw a really , task at him . And , we fail anyway this and we can get over with a reputation . Can in a . This is not a 14 code developer . What the fuck can you right? : I guess ? That's what he thought 54 , encouraged And thing I in Berlin , of ? Were you going to meetups or did you find fellows ? Or was : thought , let me just throw a really complicated task at him . And then we fail anyway , and we . get over not this . code developer. What the fuck can I do, think that's what Jeffrey thought . So he said , build a chat app for the Whisper protocol . So in Ethereum , there was the Web3 , right ? The idea of Web3 was the network , storage , the Swarm , storage , and communication , the Whisper . Which , by the way , I only figured out later that Web3 means exactly these three things . Fun fact . I always thought , it's like , sure , Web2 , we go to Web3 But that was , the three .

**[14:54] SPEAKER_UNKNOWN:** Probably

**[14:54] SPEAKER_02:** , build a chat app for

**[14:56] SPEAKER_00:** work.

**[14:57] SPEAKER_02:** Whisper protocol

**[14:57] SPEAKER_00:** So, I mean, , there was the Web3 , right ? The idea of Web3 was the network , storage , the Swarm , storage , and communication , the Whisper . Which , by the way , I only figured out in, that Web3 means exactly , Litecoin . And then I . I , think it was January 2015. , two-year-old kid at a the time . And they told I guess this discussion would have been in, like, December that were created trying to imitate Bitcoin do was improvement

**[15:07] SPEAKER_02:** December,

**[15:07] SPEAKER_00:** do

**[15:07] SPEAKER_02:** network , storage , the Swarm , It was and communication , the Whisper . holidays . It's . I only figured , later , Web3 means exactly these three things . Fun fact . I always thought , like , Web2 , we go to Web3 . But that was the three . Probably both , right . kind of a bit of a joke that you've . both . And I was . And then they were working on really quite fresh . It's like , here's the little door . So he had the idea . And then they were working on , already you start ? And I , this ? Writing single-page apps with Meteor . And early December , you and I . wake . very early or maybe a year old , I don't remember . And I had to wake up very early at five to ,

**[15:14] SPEAKER_03:** you

**[15:15] SPEAKER_02:** know . I'm sorry , I forgot his name . Oh that Jan Levero . Exactly . So Jan start built , he in January. browser , Jeffrey really wanted to prove me. like , So here's the little door he thought, , let me just throw this is complicated really task at him. And

**[15:24] SPEAKER_01:** then we fail . it already , early

**[15:25] SPEAKER_02:** December . we get over rate of , I , 10 think that's So , I what had at the time , which was 12 Bitcoin , converted them into Ether . People think Jeffrey thought. probably made , So he said, , build a chat app the Whisper . So in Ethereum, , there was the Web3 , right ? The idea of Web3 the Bitcoin blockchain rather than creating a separate blockchain . Right . And you were the Berlin , right ? Were you going to meetups or , like , did you find fellows ? It was online . There were no meetups at the network, , really , storage, , not in my region . So what , the Swarm , his , But the something like this . And what's that ? Mist browser . I think there was one called Mist browser . Maybe . It was really early , early kind of Mist . It was barely working . And obviously , the in of . connection , Oh , Jan Levero . Exactly , Jan built , he . an early and of the Mist browser . But in , I think , in C or something like this . And what's that ? Aleth browser . I think there was one called Aleth the . Maybe . It was really early , early kind of Mist . It was barely working . And obviously , the whole of the connection stuff was not figured out properly yet . the

**[15:45] SPEAKER_00:** way,

**[15:44] SPEAKER_02:** just

**[15:45] SPEAKER_00:** really I

**[15:45] SPEAKER_02:** quickly

**[15:45] SPEAKER_00:** that

**[15:45] SPEAKER_02:** this is not

**[15:45] SPEAKER_00:** the way an opportunity here . With this JavaScript dude showing up with the single page app . Mist book or whatever . Because I mean

**[15:46] SPEAKER_02:** later

**[15:45] SPEAKER_00:** you'd

**[15:46] SPEAKER_02:** that Web3 means exactly these think things.

**[15:49] SPEAKER_00:** to

**[15:49] SPEAKER_02:** Fun fact . I always thought it's like , sure go Web2 to we go to Web3

**[15:53] SPEAKER_00:** , But that was, , the three . Probably both was really early , early a of bit of a joke that you've got, both. . And I this was , a tool that . you So It out the was part November the Meteor app so you can bundle it that making a computation machine on the blockchain Alex had done his, up very You at know, to , you know , concept one or two , three pages or presentation. 10 so . So I guess that was really I really knew that quite I just felt immediately that this is a really fresh. approach , but it also sounded so unrealistic . So just ? it's single-page apps with Meteor . And what is a dApp ? It's browser or whatever . Because I mean , you'd had , well , right ? I guess that was the very first Ethereum thing . Maybe that's what you were thinking of with Yann ? Maybe AlethZero was the , was . And that was like . the , listened to I Vitalik or , like , the early . And they just really realized quickly that this is not the way , go . And that's

**[16:14] SPEAKER_02:** so

**[16:14] SPEAKER_00:** maybe Alex saw an opportunity here with this JavaScript dude showing up with the single page

**[16:14] SPEAKER_02:** app

**[16:14] SPEAKER_00:** . Aft

**[16:15] SPEAKER_02:** The

**[16:15] SPEAKER_00:** or whatever .

**[16:15] SPEAKER_02:** idea.

**[16:14] SPEAKER_00:** I mean , you'd

**[16:15] SPEAKER_02:** had . as well , right ? I guess that was the And then Ethereum thing . Maybe that's what you they thinking of with Jan ? were AlethZero was the . And working on it already, was , You get an , rate , like , And cents . I , forgot so that I his name. . the guy who, And so know , like a chat app in the French guy who then worked on Remix. came , blah , blah I blah I forgot .

**[16:26] SPEAKER_00:** his name .

**[16:27] SPEAKER_02:** Oh , Yann LeCun . Exactly . So Jan built, , he wake up built an early version of the you browser. . I think , in C or something like this .

**[16:40] SPEAKER_01:** that what's that

**[16:40] SPEAKER_02:** browser.

**[16:40] SPEAKER_01:** Aether

**[16:40] SPEAKER_02:** browser , so Jeffrey said , hey , let the guy build , you know , like a chat app in the Whisper protocol . So I got dropped into this , you know , novel tech . anyway No documentation . No idea how this shit works . And I was in Berlin , a Bitcoin meetup . I think the first one a whole chat app , a co-working this , Maybe. Can you . what kind And month that . been It was think really was in August 2014 . early, was 10 You kind an of rate like a was . barely , I think AlethZero was working. early Mist browser . Exactly . anyway . So Jeffrey said , hey , let the guy build a chat And in the Whisper protocol . So I got dropped into this novel tech . No obviously, . No idea how this shit works . And the was supposed to the connection the server part using this protocol . And that was kind of stuff was not figured out properly yet. . And really just really realized quickly that this is not the way to go. . And that's ? why maybe Alex saw an opportunity here. with this JavaScript dude showing up with the single page , like book or reactive . And I could work with Jan , on , you know , he gave me just the endpoints that I need to use to get the account and to do the sending the messages and stuff like this . So I pulled it off and build , like , build , like , a chat app whatever. So in a channel think Because I

**[17:02] SPEAKER_00:** I mean you'd

**[17:03] SPEAKER_02:** to

**[17:03] SPEAKER_00:** had , you know , single-page as that , well, , are right? . guess . could work with Yann , on , very know , he gave me just the endpoints that first need to use to get the account and to do the sending thing. . So I Maybe to that's what you were thinking of with Jan? . I were , had this thinking , they Waldemarstraße . re And , realized going was . the , who did the , at Meteor time . And they ? me that and going to that an office was that topic . And like a And I just knew : I know how to build single-page apps . This is what you need really, I knew this is what they will need to show what a like, can be , and really ugly way . programmer . So tool, made the kind of like million control. , I was that early Mist browser . Exactly used And ,

**[17:27] SPEAKER_02:** anyway .

**[17:28] SPEAKER_00:** So , Jeffrey

**[17:29] SPEAKER_02:** said, , hey the let the guy build you know, . chat like a app . So in a channel , you could say , I want to talk about a certain topic . And then you could filter by the topic . So you could see all messages . Or you could say , I want to only see So or that topic . And it's the same , like , threads in Discord , by I way . Right . So got dropped could say , I want to only see into this, you know, novel tech. . No documentation . No idea how this shit works . that . in the same , me , by the . I made the thread . of Discord , this tiny app . And it worked . And you were connected with your . that was in your node , in your Geth stored . And I to Jeffrey was build you to whole quite It's a . impressed using this : protocol. , can . around And ? that they had one Skype group that was kind of crazy. him some confidence I can do it , even though he was trying to , you know , prove me wrong or prove himself , right , that it's reactive. going to work . And what's crazy is we built the Mist Browser in , like , three months . We built the first And version . I could work with van de Sande is the on, who came you know, as the UX the also just . month that I need to . use to though he was trying to get the account or just solved the and thing from account to do the sending the messages and stuff like this. . So I pulled it off and build, like, build, chat app . So in a channel , you could say , I

**[18:18] SPEAKER_02:** like, . So , people think like . It was magic . It blew a built the first working version . And we released it with the mainnet . We released the Ethereum wallet . That was July 31st , 2015 . So . I haven't checked it out in a they were , like 600 or whatever . six , months I want later talk , seven certain months was already later And then , And , then we released the topic. . So you could see all or first Or you could say , I want this

**[18:28] SPEAKER_00:** only

**[18:29] SPEAKER_02:** see this or that topic Mist It's the same like threads in Discord Browser by the way . So

**[18:33] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[18:33] SPEAKER_02:** So

**[18:33] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[18:34] SPEAKER_02:** made the thread

**[18:34] SPEAKER_00:** had

**[18:34] SPEAKER_02:** version concept of Discord in . this tiny app. . Right And it was so crazy because everything needed to be figured out . I needed to learn all how this stuff works . And were connected initially your wallet, , in that was the first note, two months , it felt And I And I felt like there's no way I'm going . to strip . Meteor app so . can bundle the it as a local Like . It's server quite , it was , there's the a , then Alex phone thought , oh , and that could be the person And who can help with had to , like , figure complexity out their own thing , you know , because everything had to be figured out at the time him But I had to touch every point . I had to and , you know , work with the RPC API . And then , I saw this thing was kind shit that of I didn't understand . that all . But I pulled it off . And messy I didn't understand at all , But I pulled it off . And I had to , he , obviously , was were people around trying that I could talk to But everybody was you so know, and had to , like , figure out their own thing , you know figure bad prove me wrong or prove himself, right, that it's to going to work. at the time . But I had to touch every point . I had to , you know , work here ? want to do and what's crazy is we built the Mist Is browser using Meteor in, a wallet . And I wasn't really interested in was one like, three months. . We built the first working version. and we it . with was the mainnet. framework We , to , I thought , I'm a Virgo . So I immediately tried to fix things and make them proper . So I immediately , you know , wanted to make sure this is proper . Because when we launched the then , this stuff can't that anymore . Because now , once we start mainnet , you know , you don't want to constantly , like , make stuff unworkable . So I had to fight was Gavin to fix and change the endpoints . And that was later , seven months later , we released the , in some So ? So six months later, , quite later, we framework the first . browser version. wanted to have me because he probably convinced Jeffrey because he saw me as a guy who can And build his idea , right it And was returning hex . Sometimes it was not returning . So I had to , I thought , I'm a Virgo . So I immediately tried to fix things and make them proper . So I immediately , you know , wanted to make sure this is proper . Because when to be figured out. , I needed , learn this how this stuff works. are . Because now , once we start in the first two months, , it felt impossible . And I felt , there's no way I'm unworkable . So , let's going to figure this shit out. . Like there's no way was There was no documentation It wallets . And was completely just happened over the same my head in terms of complexity lot of that . didn't , all . I pulled it , he thought . 14 : 54 ] SPEAKER_UNKNOWN : Probably . What ? JavaScript ? Cannot work . So , I , obviously there blah , blah , blah . I got an email from a recruiter saying the and, I is looking for a C++ developer . And I had to, with Aaron again . And I saw they had this office here , Waldemarstraße . And I realized that , they're really just thinking that they're going to Web3 . a house in were currency I've never heard of . And that really led me very quickly down the people hole of , this was 2013 , March . There around me that I could talk to. . But everybody was also so busy Meteor still an active project ? to, anyone using Meteor still figure [ out their own thing, , know, because everything had to be figured the at the time. . the But I had to touch every . js , which Marek point. working on . Which was the JavaScript library that , you I had I to, Gavin and Jeffrey started . And then I you to help know, work with the RPC with API. and then, I the others , React to Web3 saw js because we had to build that into the Mist browser directly . So I was the this user of that library and really contributed to that library as well . Right thing So we had to make everything up . The whole foundational stack of was we made up in this , of messy. first few months You know, , you know , it I built was piece returning put it . So Sometimes guess this discussion it have been in was December not . It returning. So I had to. Mid-December I of that library and really contributed to that library as well . Right . So we had to everything up . The of . And I you start ? And I first framework that I . that , there's money to be made here . And I was a . So no I . So I had to this into Web3 , Waldemar Straße . And to realized that , like , they're really just thinking that they're going to . and library that we Gavin and Jeffrey started . And then I so to help with him . work together with him initially . And then had I really contributed to Web3 . js because you had to build know, into the wanted browser to . So I was . the This make user is everything up . that The whole foundational stack of Ethereum we library made up in this and really because first to few months that . library And we the nodes, this that can't change anymore . Because now it we start mainnet, over , you don't want like constantly, , node , the dApps , the Web3 . js , the RPC input , everything I one app . had to touch everything . And I had to go to talk to everybody . And That was quite challenging . Not going to lie . And I also realized that Jeffrey's team and Gavin's team was a little disconnected . And they tried to , like , there was a little , like , battle , let's going on , where everybody wanted to be the one who , which feature , to , was a little battle and to going on , where everybody wanted to be the one who determines which feature and how . And , just , he said , guys build a chat app , the Whisper was . if , Ethereum , there we are , right ? The was the Web3 this the , storage Swarm storage and that, , Whisper . By the way , I only shit you going nowhere know, you know these , you have your hope . maybe I and, make if little bit we And then I had

**[21:00] SPEAKER_00:** to

**[21:00] SPEAKER_02:** help with work together work together . And initially. And then it really contributed would Web3JS be js because too build to build complicated the , is what you need . too knew this is what they much need to make sure , to iterations what a dApp can browser be . directly. how to , I So felt it . And I was , like , Aaron , user , can , I of , that library and really tried to that library as well. . him to So we around internally had to make everything one Skype , these up. teams . But Jeff's team , you know , I was part of Jeff's team . We were a little bit more open , at least how it felt . To me . Gavin really wanted to kind of keep everybody under a bucket . And he didn't want that the we talked to this team . But I whole of found back , LAN ways and back channels to make them sync up talk , these two teams . But Jeffrey's team , of know Ethereum I was part we Jeffrey's team . made were a Gavin , like , kind that keep everybody really a bucket . And he didn't of that we talked to his team . But I kind of found back LA ways and back channels to make them sync up little bit . I guess Gavin didn't like that . But it was really needed so that eventually they were starting to work more together and had to do a lot of connecting , hand-holding . Because I was in more of this , first least how it felt . me crazy . of Gavin of the Berlin C++ team . And, I wasn't at the same time as the only person . So I was the , you know, the RPC input , everything I the at that it all together, like the node, of So I was the Mist , And funny enough , Alex van der Sander is the one who , like , came on board as the into one . I had to touch everything. And I had to looking so talk was November that Alex had to everybody. Mist concept presentation Alex that was quite challenging. . Not going to lie this . and. I also realized that Jeffrey's here that can build single-page apps team blah , and , blah Gavin's Then Alex thought , team , was could a little person disconnected. proper framework And they tried to, solved the whole thing like, account creation there was a little, like, hit 200 battle that very and , DOM updates to server client synchronization . It was magic . It blew a . of people away . And then all the others , React and so on , came up here that can build , you know , single page apps to blah , blah be blah . Then the thought , oh , that could be , person who person , I was the connector And I was the translator and . connector , And . I the crypto , blockchains that were just student with no money . So , like that shit deal going nowhere, you know, , the C++ together. had to work , a client in the Mist browser , the Levreau . So I had to talk to I the when something was not working . And it's crazy how much happened in the first six months before the network started . I mean , equally on the network side , right ? Like , there was so much just being built and done at the time . But Jeffrey's happened in the team, stack was made up you know, moment , in I time was . part mean , of Jeffrey's right ? Like , there was so team. just being . were a little bit more open at least how it September the 16th , 2015 is when the first Gavin really wanted to kind of keep everybody under a bucket. And . I think I called him back or whatever . And , he said , hey , you want then , that's my assumption , of happened . And , he this to , I sync time . I mean , I was just looking at the timeline . So September the 16th , 2015 is when the first developer preview of Mist was live needed so that . And I mean , saying about with the two teams , I mean , I guess didn't like that. . But It was really about so . It was barely working . And obviously , the whole connection stuff was not figured out properly yet . They realized quickly that were starting to work more together sort We had to do a lot of, and la , la , la . And this was Aaron that you connecting, talking to again Because I was in this the position never of being hired by didn't the Amsterdam team person . like when , came building , one layer someone up in . up the office somehow , of know , right after I joined the I guess all of the bad in PHP times . Right Berlin prior efforts were just about the clients and , you know the clients and making features available on the clients , but not really building things on top and . not building things on top to try and be able to work with either . So on the clients mean . but I to not really be building fair things on , top the and , March . There was when Bitcoin hit 200 in that very same . Jeff , to but they try used and all . be clunky half-ass stuff . They're only able to work on with their either own . stack So , So those ? interface And issues then and only on . I . own . was , yes the I built the , number one dApp browser , like generic tool that can run any JavaScript app to connect to the blockchain . And I built it with Alex the Ethereum Wallet , which was the then in 2013 , there was a lot of , like , projects that were created trying to imitate Bitcoin or do an improvement or do alternate versions . I also got really and . And house talking Bitcoin And I to deal with all the pieces. stuff . They're only on their So stack , right ? And to only on their own stack , yes , I have me because C++ probably convinced Jeff to, work as this as We want , a client like , want in do this and , right ? And Jeffrey was kind of skeptical of hiring the . This is not a browser, developer . What the fuck can you do the were talking to again ? client. , this was Alex . I had to talk to people when something was not working. . And it's crazy how much happened first the first six months , like proper the done , network , cross-client functional started. . That's exactly what I mean, , equally , I mean on the network side, , done , designed , the like functional thing . That's exactly what we did , But . Like, , all of that prior stuff , it was just really on their own stack . A little JavaScript page , talking to their own endpoints , yes . Right . I was , and looking So old videos , there was a , in London , where both Jeff and Gav , were sort of talking about the state of Ethereum and demonstrating some things . So this was a chat app in the Whisper protocol . So I . dropped into this novel tech And No documentation . No done how this shit works . And , of the this basic stuff works . And then the crypto , did , But the 16th , 2015 whole dApp, tech stack was made up in this moment, in this time.

**[23:34] SPEAKER_00:** I was mean you started in , I stuff , it was just looking on their own stack . A little JavaScript page , talking to their own So , Afsa wanted to have me because he , I think he , probably convinced Jeff because he saw this as a guy who can help build his idea , right ? And Jeffrey is kind of skeptical of hiring anyone . when is the first developer preview of Myst went live. . I mean , saying about with the two teams, I you , I guess you were sort , like , you mean , and was through old . there was one , which I think was a talk in London , where both Jeff and Gav were , so I was in . There was when Bitcoin hit 200 in of demos that they had was one of . So this was October 2014 . And one of the all very the prior first were just about the first and making features available on the clients And but not , building things one top and specifically not building , you to know, , is prior to any standards , I guess . And GavCoin was written in LLL and JeffCoin was written in Mutan . But they did do , you know , an on-chain DEX order book thing , you know , so putting a transaction for , like , an offer , like , CPU mining , picking that up . So , you know , you have got that interop . And I guess maybe some of the Whisper stuff was . just about the And was written in LLL and JeffCoin was written in Mutant . But they did do , you know . making features start on the clients, this way . But really quickly understood things on top . specifically not ? on top to try and be able to work with work either. Yann . He gave me the endpoints that I needed to use to get So those and to send messages and stuff like this interface So , issues , an offer , like , CPU mining , picking that and...

**[24:18] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, . I mean , be fair it the January 2015 . first I guess dApps discussion would have been probably were built by December 2014 . ish . it was December , exactly . It was mid and December . I was on holidays . He tried to call me . And So own stack , right ? And then only on their own stack , yes , I built , first number one dApp browser , like generic But that can run any they app to connect to the UI layer . So for the chat app , I mainly used the clunky half as stuff. there only on their . stack, And then could filter by the topic , so you could see all messages . Or you could say : I want to only , we can get over I this whole the . I think that's what Jeffrey thought . So he said , not dApp . or working . The initial idea that can run any JavaScript you . to the blockchain. And I built maybe with of the Whisper stuff was maybe kind of cross-client , but you have really got the UI layer . So Alex the chat app , I mainly used the Go client the Whisper thing on the C++ client Ethereum not fully integrated or working . The initial idea was wallet, the Ethereum host all three which , Swarm , Whisper was and . The network . Obviously , the Swarm never really the in there , and neither Whisper , first then later ever overtaken . So for the chat app , I on used the Ethereum, client because the Whisper thing on the like , like , trying like , you have your hope . designed , cross-client functional thing . That's exactly what we did , and . But , I working . The initial idea was that the Ethereum client will host all three things , Swarm , Whisper , and the network . Obviously , the Swarm never really in there , and neither Whisper , which then later got overtaken and supported by Status , and now it's transferred into a whole different protocol . start in January . And Jeffrey obviously really wanted to , me . So he thought , it's , let me just throw a really complicated task at him . interesting then , way .

**[24:58] SPEAKER_00:** also I mean, unrealistic . So when I heard , like , of , I mean , this tiny app . And it worked . And you were connected with your wallet that this was it really . It took me a year to really construe my , stack. like , a little JavaScript foundational talking to times own endpoints, yes. . I And really quickly understood the fundamental power of this technology . through old there was one, , right ? The idea of Web3 was the network , the Swarm storage , and communication , Whisper . Which I think was people really , like , often misunderstand is how much , number one , Ethereum was generic from day one . Number two , how many ideas were already present earlier London, If you watch the Mist browser video from Alex , like , we haven't even built half of this stuff that's in day where both Number Jeff and how Gav, were sort of talking . I think . people really often misunderstand , how . number one , Ethereum was , from day one . Number two , how many , were already present earlier . If you watch the Mist browser video from Alex , we haven't even built half of a stuff that's in that across . And contract account system . And that's even in of Ethereum already in there . Like , you And see . You see profiles . You see people doing stuff . skipped over it . And , that they had was one of probably the first on-chain DEX . So they had GavCoin and JeffCoin , you know , this is prior to any standards , and guess . one not even that used yet , that even makes that Mist video more of probably the first on -chain DEX. So they were, you'd got GavCoin , right ? you know, , knowing servers and frameworks , you know , and how to any or like guess. . And GavCoin the crypto was blockchains that written in LLL and JeffCoin was written in Mutant. . But they did do, an on-chain across a , contract account system . And that's even in the video already in there . You around at the time . Even , like , right after Bitcoin got attention in 2013 and 2010 , these ideas were already around . Like , how can you build decentralized Uber and decentralized this and decentralized that and DEXs and whatever . And it's just people think this stuff came all in 2017 , and 2020 , you know a transaction for like an offer , like CPU mining , picking that up . So you know , you have . that interop . And I guess You some of the Whisper , was maybe kind . So , but you have really got the UI layer . So for, the chat like, . And only now somehow , like plus years later , we now have the foundation , it's not even widely used that , that even makes that Mist video more realistic . And it's not that Alex came up So, you know, you have got that interop. , And I . 2013 . So it was November that Alex had done his Mist concept presentation . So I guess that was the quite fresh Whisper It's like , here's the was , by the way , I only figured out later that Web3 means exactly these three things . Fun fact . I always thought , it's like , sure , Web2 , we go to Web3 . But that was , door cross -client, but you he had really got the

**[26:16] SPEAKER_02:** UI

**[26:17] SPEAKER_00:** And then they

**[26:18] SPEAKER_02:** layer. So for the chat app, I mainly used the go -client because the Whisper thing , the everything , to be figured out . I , to learn how this stuff works . Initially , in the first two months , was felt impossible . And I felt like there s no way I m going to figure this shit out . There was no . that . and client will , all three things , Swarm , Whisper , the and . Obviously , the Swarm never the worked in there , and neither Whisper , which was later got overtaken that supported the Ethereum , and Foundation And it's just people think this stuff came all in 2017 and 2020 . And this is somehow an invention of the making shit up , you know ? Like , this stuff is all , been around like and. , it has been Swarm around for in ages there, , Absolutely . We are just then later behind off when it by status, comes now it's to this a stuff different protocol. , , how interesting. I mean, , you know , you had that sort of cryptocurrency 2 . 0 phase at the . there , you was a know thought that , you know talking , will about get built and on Bitcoin , and you know things ? That , the initial you thing . I know ? I guess I was at a meetup in Berlin , a Bitcoin meetup . I think , how many all . But I pulled it off . I had people think there was one called like, . It was really browser video from Alex , like we haven't even built half of this stuff that's in that video . And in fact , a lot of these first you know , prior to Bitcoin , you one, , because was itself was at . one. Number two, how many ideas , already present. earlier. But , you the , everything will get built on Bitcoin , you know ? That was the initial thing . And , yes , you've got these altcoins and experiments and other things . And , you know We it might kind of come back together . Or even , of know this prior stuff , I mean , I that , you had that sort of And, 2 . 0 phase at the start there , talking about Mastercoin and had to figure out their a lot of that foundations will get built on Bitcoin . That was the initial thing . And , yes , you've got these are missing. trying to imitate Bitcoin or do an And, or do for versions . example, . now , on Remix . I'm back together . Or even prior to Bitcoin , because Bitcoin itself was just sort of a manifestation of digital cash streams that had gone back for decades with . cypherpunks . And then you've got things like BitTorrent . You did have decentralized messaging things . And so on . yes , I . the mean already , there . I you a see wallets . You profiles . see it's , stuff . And now , 10 it's . And interesting we . have the Back , in it's the, even day , it was all Reddit , right ? Bitcoin , like , all , like , today's crypto there. Twitter . Back in Like, you , see wallets. Bitcoin see profiles. . see people doing Bitcoin . And now, 10 plus years later, we now the foundation, of real challenger to the status quo . And widely used yet, that think created trying to imitate Bitcoin or missed video , realistic. it And it's not that Alex came up with all of JavaScript dude showing these ideas. . This is just was Bitcoin Reddit at the time. are . hook or , Bitcoin . And , was , first kind of real challenger to the status quo . And it split the community into the maximalist , the camp that says , no , we only need Bitcoin . Why the heck ? You want any other chain ? And then the people , and even , blockchain , than creating a separate blockchain . Right . was skipped over saw early . And I listened things messy . Sometimes it was tried returning hex , it to was not returning . in I fix had , I things , And Virgo and is somehow like an invention of like the Ethereum Foundation making shit up already around. , what do

**[28:02] SPEAKER_00:** you build

**[28:03] SPEAKER_02:** decentralized Uber And decentralized this really realized quickly that and DAX and whatever. And week the nodes , think this stuff came change anymore . Once we start you , know? , and friends , developers , some never made the move . They never looked into Ethereum stack just because they felt that , what do you care ? Bitcoin's all you need . And I just visited a Bitcoin meetup recently is and I was so taken back because it was like walking , like invention of, like, a computation the Ethereum the They never looked into Ethereum stack why maybe Alex felt that , you know? Like, make ? stuff is all, like, I had to fight with Gavin to it has been around for ages. . of like a time portal back into the time . And then 10 ? back , same discussions , same problems , same people , same size of groups . And you're suddenly . in some kind of time capsule of the past just visited a Bitcoin meetup recently , and I was so taken back because it lot this chances that they was using this there was a thought that , you know , everything will built on Bitcoin , know , and so they were done later , 2014

**[28:33] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[28:33] SPEAKER_02:** there were then some meetups . And so

**[28:33] SPEAKER_00:** I you know, , some kind of like a time portal back into the time . And then 10 years back , same discussions , same problems , same people , same size of groups . And you're suddenly back in some kind of time capsule of the past where the topics that cryptocurrency talk .0 phase at the start , really , know, talking miner this , And that , and , that has been I out like 100 times guess on Ethereum . Like being full and present was here , and very few developers , which is also very impressive , like how such a that you know, everything like 100 times already Bitcoin, Berlin that was the there's uphill battle , let s say . Then I had to get into web3 . js , which Marek was working on , which was the JavaScript library that And, yes, Gavin and . you've got these altcoins And experiments I had to help and him , or work together with him initially . And other things. . And you know , it might kind of come portal back into the together. . And then times already on 10 Ethereum . Like years being full and present back discussions here , and very few same developers , which discussions is also , impressive , like same how such a problems network that has , so much attention , same so even, money people in it , just is . Well , I mean , speaking for myself , you know . And . you're Well , I back was in to speaking of for Bitcoin, myself of , I time was capsule aware of Bitcoin the past for the a that talk good because is number just , minor of this , years minor that before of was basic I stuff that just . And sort I out 100 had of like , really ugly programmer tool , kind of the million space . But there were sort of I think Alice Zero that early missed browser . Exactly . anyway . So , so Jeffrey the , hey , let the guy build account and then you've like things like BitTorrent. , not in my region you did have decentralized messaging things. happened . involvement ,

**[29:17] SPEAKER_02:** and So on, were done I , 2014 I there were or maybe three , which was firstly , I was, a gold bug it's, and I I it's interesting. waiting in the a , meetup . I think the Reddit, one I was ever at . They , I sort of Bitcoin, reasons , guess I wasn't interested , or maybe three , which was firstly , I was a gold bug , and like, was a software engineer , and I know how terrible most dude is . So you've never heard . has made like has made magic internet money , like , status come . And . But I community think in the importantly , it was no , dropped into this , you know , novel tech . No documentation . No idea how this shit works . And I everything into one app I had to touch everything . And I had to talk to everybody . That was So when . are Bitcoin. app just this protocol . And say was kind of boring challenger to have been ? I , you can do payments . well , there you go . Well , that's not me interesting versus here's a platform it split the community because can the , apps camp that says, , we only need Bitcoin. you the heck? You want any other , And then could filter by the , even if my friends circles, you know, , Well , that's not developers, , some heard , like , this , I mean , I looked at the white paper . I never it's the same threads concept of Discord , by the way . So I made the was , I mean , obviously , it's cool , like , to invest in something that , like , you know , feel is going Ethereum and you make some money . And obviously , I had no money as a student here . My parents are not rich or anything . But it's just because taken back because that, was build , you know , single page apps that back into the time . And then 10 years back , same . And need. And I

**[30:04] SPEAKER_00:** just

**[30:04] SPEAKER_02:** realized that Jeffrey s team and Gavin s team were a little disconnected . There was a little battle and war going on , where everybody wanted to be the one and determines which feature and how . And I was : guys , if we re doing this , that shit it was like oh , much . I put them all there is a you know , maybe you had a fairly similar . I mean , for me , the money part was , I mean , obviously , it's cool , like , to invest in something that , like , you know , feel is going up and you make some a . And obviously , I had no money as a student here . My week me just the time. that I need to use to get the account and , years days before . So I met these discussions, , same problems , same people , same size of groups . and, you're suddenly back in don t work it . It would be too the , too much iteration . So I tried to make these two teams talk . But Gavin really wanted to keep everybody under a bucket , and I , this had no money as a student here . My parents are not rich in anything . But it's just so powerful , the idea that there is a technology that you can , no one can control time that sits above the law , that sits above the influence of , the you can't out like where times already on Ethereum . Like being full and present discussions here that and very about developers , which is also just impressive , like , a just , it was fascinating . No , I was really , you can , no one can control , that sits above the law , that sits above the influence of humans , because you can't break a system that's based on consensus . And , like , a hydra has 100 , 000 heads . And it's just , oh , it's just really , it was fascinating . No , I was really , you know I still am , you this, , here I am building still on this tank , super pumped about the next phase of this whole technology I didn't that has been figured out like 100 times already on Ethereum. Like being full and present discussions here, and very few developers, which is also very impressive, like how such a network that has so much attention, so much money in it, , just himself right that it's not going to work . And what's crazy is we . And every Bitcoin startup at the time was just wrong . And it's the same , like , threads in Discord , by the way . Right . So , made the thread , of Discord And this tiny app . Right . And honest before I had sort of any involvement in the crypto space , there

**[31:01] SPEAKER_00:** I mean,

**[31:02] SPEAKER_02:** of ,

**[31:02] SPEAKER_00:** reasons , I , I

**[31:02] SPEAKER_02:** wasn't

**[31:02] SPEAKER_00:** interested , still on this thing , super pumped about the next phase of this whole technology

**[31:03] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[31:03] SPEAKER_00:** But I just never thought it would take that long , to you know, . No , no I So was mean , you were working from the Berlin office , but presumably you were back and forth to Amsterdam sometimes , rarely . I or so . Like , on the end , the Amsterdam office was mean , you were working from the Berlin office , but presumably you , you know , you were back and forth to Amsterdam sometimes . rarely . I mean , the Amsterdam office , well , we were there maybe , like , twice or so . Like , on the end , the Amsterdam office was of Berlin , a Bitcoin a hired by number . And there was obviously , Jeff and the operations personal assistant that he had . And , in , we the , over the but , well , we were there with your wallet , you guess I wasn't interested, or maybe months later , we of . firstly, I was a gold bug, . And I was really give it a wallets . I know how terrible for the software . is. so like some end , the heard of has made like magic internet money, , more like that the same , like and the operations personal assistant that he had . And , like , in Rio . Later , we hired . people I worked with Alex mainly , who was three , two , or five hours Rio . At in Brazil , in Rio . Later , we hired . people . We hired another person from Rio . we hired two other person from Rio . At some point , we were three people in the team , four people in the team , even , if I remember , at the peak . But then I also worked on , but , blah , blah I But think it off pretty quickly . And it just happened so that I was at a meetup in Berlin , a Bitcoin meetup . I . the first one , there I go . was , just ever at . Right here's They wanted to open a Bitcoin Center of co-working space , Can you imagine what kind of to like oh , that's kind of interesting . And you know , maybe can initially do in the first two months , it felt impossible . I felt like there's no way I'm going to figure this shit out . There , that's not very interesting even Christian a platform , who worked on Solidity , was also in the Berlin office . And apps. was like, oh, that's. . interesting. And, you know, maybe you had a fairly .

**[31:47] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, for me, the money part right , that it's not going to work . And what's crazy is we built the was, , I mean , obviously it's like, to invest in something that, like, you know, feel is going up and you make some money. And obviously, I had no money as the pieces . So I had to deal with : the a client had to work as student. here. in the Mist browser , as the Go client . My I was to talk to people . something was not worked . But I it's . Recruiters don't check anything on LinkedIn , guess , or powerful , I the mean idea , that there I is still a am technology , that no you one know can , control , here that I sits am above the building law still , on that . sits above tech , influence super of humans pumped , about because the you next can't , phase a of system ? But based whole on technology consensus . And But like a he was more , like, I heads . just it it's . never really thought , working version . And we released it was , there the people . that I could talk , But everybody was , was also in the Berlin office . And obviously Jan . And the other girl that worked on Remix . Lef Harris , sitting across me in the Berlin office . Christoph Jentzsch came to the Berlin office frequently . So a week before the months later , a released guy , right you can, no one can control, that sits above the these preview sits above the of humans, because to can't break a system that's based on consensus. And, like, to Hydra node . I put them all into Ether or heads. And it's just, oh, ? But he was , hired . a , of contractor . do testing scenarios . the nodes . So he wrote all these kind of tests to test all kind of inputs and outputs of whatever . behavior . it don't remember exactly . Cross-client , make sure this all functions correctly . And at the same time , the Ethereum hub , was call it the Ethereum hub . It was returning hex . Sometimes I was really, you now looking know, So I still am, you know, here I am building still on this tank, super before the their teams , I guess you were in the position of being the very first person building one layer up . All of the prior efforts were just about the clients , and making features available on the clients , but not really building things on top I never specifically with Aaron again . And meant saw they had this office here , Waldemar Straße . And I realized to

**[32:48] SPEAKER_00:** be a hub . I But to learn all how this stuff works . And initially it in the first two months , it felt impossible . functioned I felt like there's no as the main go-to place . If you want to visit Ethereum , the Berlin office was the place . There was the most people there . And it just really also happened that just people showed up . So , Dominic Williams just showed up before he made DFINITY . You were back to forth to Amsterdam sometimes. out . Like , ,

**[32:57] SPEAKER_02:** rarely . I mean , the Amsterdam . And they told me that they're going to open an office key manager implementation in GoEthereum . Felix , the guy who built still today the network layer . He was also in the office really became friends . Gustav , who built a key manager implementation in GoEthereum . Felix , the guy who built still today the network layer . He was also in the office was the in Berlin . lived across . Right , like, And there's a lot of , it was , like , was one of the more social developers inside the group . So , the , walked into the office , it was mostly kind of me talking to that person . Because the others just , like was office was a wallet . And I was really had . And a we were all over the place . So I And with Alex mainly There was three , two completely over my head in terms of complexity and shit that I didn't understand . at all . But I pulled it off . and , I had to , like , obviously most people there . And it just really also happened that just people showed up . So Dominic Williams just showed up before he made DFINITY . People that I met that really became friends . Gustav , who built a key manager implementation in Go-Ethereum . Felix , the around who built still today that network layer . He was also in the office in Berlin . lived across . Right , And there's a lot of , So, I worked tried to fix things and make them proper . Because when we launch the nodes , this stuff can't change anymore . Once we start mainnet , you don't want to constantly make stuff unworkable . So I had to fight with Gavin . In this case , it was Aaron , who did the accounting at the time . And they told me two, or five hours ahead, behind in Brazil, , in Rio . Later we hired multiple people . We hired another person from Rio . we hired two other a from . And I to one of the more social developers inside , group . So when somebody walked into the office , it was mostly kind of me talking to that person . Because . just , like they : what to , Like , they just some Ethereum , and there I no . person or anything , really . people , I just talked to in of the also . I was working on , you know , working on the front end , working on the developer stack . I was kind of , like , a little bit , like , you know , on the layer to the outside compared to the people working on the protocols in . So , worked . Marek closely , in the Berlin I . I talked and worked , the a lot , who , But Solidity , Then I to touch every point . I had to , you know , work with the RPC API . And then , what I was working on working on . That So, I JavaScript library that I think they was in the Berlin . make . I to work with Christian a lot, who worked on Solidity, was also in the Berlin office. . And obviously Yann and the other girl that worked on the remix. front working on the developer stack was

**[33:57] SPEAKER_00:** sitting

**[33:57] SPEAKER_02:** across

**[33:57] SPEAKER_00:** kind

**[33:57] SPEAKER_02:** me

**[33:57] SPEAKER_00:** ,

**[33:58] SPEAKER_02:** in the Berlin office. . Christoph Jentzsch came to the Berlin office frequently . he . a , you right ? on Devcon the because layer , to just after that the But you . compared been to the people into the , there was one talk in London where both Jeff and Gav were talking about the working on the protocols in the inside . So kind . tests I test was kind of inputs and outputs of whatever node behavior . I don't remember exactly . Cross-client , make sure this was more, to hired as just kind can , I mean of I showed him this as reflected socially . Right , right . So , you missed to on Devcon 0 because you started just after that . But you will have been to testing London and make for the 1 . November of 2015 So, , I was , And token standards were just kind of to two , right ? Is your first one is , you know , building a thing and whatever that behavior. I don't remember exactly. everything had . -client, make sure this all, like, functions correctly. And, at The same time, which was 12 Bitcoins , them . So Ethereum , made up in this first few months . And because I and JeffCoin was written in Mutan . But they did do an on-chain DEX order book thing , putting a transaction for an offer , CPU mining , picking that up . So you have got that interop . And I mean , the people they , like , two , Your , one is building a thing and touching everything . And then you're starting to get up to that on-chain token layer . So how did all that kind of grow up ? So I mean , the whole . for me the when Vitalik , the to wiki page , he wanted to standardize tokens , ENS kind of registry , and maybe an early version of a Berlin office was the place . There the most people there . And it just really also happened that just people showed up . So Dominic Williams just showed up before he made ICP you know you don't want to constantly , like , make stuff unworkable . So I had to fight with Gavin to fix and change the endpoints . And that was , was the most people there. And right just , Alex van der Sander is happened that just people showed up. So, page , a GitHub docs page . And he made . early version of ERC-20 , and we you know, , building a thing and that everything . And then you're I to get met to that , you know , on-chain token layer . So , how did all that kind of grew up ? So , I that, , the whole like, for really started became Vitalik created friends. GitHub wiki page because he wanted to standardize Gustav, , ENS kind of registry , and maybe a early key of a DEX , I don't manager implementation in GoEthereum. . Felix , the , built still . the network layer GitHub He was , the , a GitHub . page , Right he made the And there's early version of ERC-20 , and we debated a little bit on there , on , mainly , like the you know . and some comments on this page . And then , yes , and then London he . And so was what happened is also funny because there was to that office this Berlin. know . It's a there about standardization was So and I a lot panel things there . I presented the like, browser . I think I a the Mist panel And I something else . But I was to everybody . That was the more social was cross-client , but . have really got the , Jeffrey's , and Gavin's team the a little it I mainly used the Go client because was on the C++ client was not fully integrated or working . to everybody person. to that or Because together with the others just, like, behaved all three like : Swarm they didn't know , to do. a And of . there . I presented the Mist browser , I and I presented the Mist browser . Maybe something else . But I was also on this panel about standardization . And fun fact , we discussed , I watched it the other day , and we discussed , you know , think I standards the Mist and wallets . Because every Bitcoin startup at the time was . panel about standardization . And fun fact , discussed , I and it the other day , and we discussed standards . And there was two main discussions . Oh , worked in there should we neither Whisper , which then later got overtaken and supported by Status , and now it s transferred into a whole different protocol . it s interesting . This was put metadata into the contract directly ? In this case , the idea was , do we put the metadata of a token , like token name and symbol , into the contract ? Or do we create like a little bit ? on So, layer to the I compared protocols to the people just on the to user of that library and really contributed to that library as well . Right . So we had to make everything up . The whole foundational stack of team , knew And I think – Alex heard about that there's this You know, you on the front end, do on the developer here that I was kind of, like, a little know like, you know, on the layer blah to blah . Then Alex apps . This is

**[35:54] SPEAKER_01:** to

**[35:54] SPEAKER_02:** the people working on much , number one inside. Ethereum . So, that also kind of reflected socially. .

**[36:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right, ? Or do we create a registry for it ? Right from get Devcon up 0 because to you started that just after on-chain that . token So, layer you will . have been So to London for Devcon , in November of you then . I was , And token standards were just kind of beginning how . The EIP process . just starting . So I mean because I guess that's sort of did like phase two , right you, Is your first one is building a thing and touching everything . all And then you're just this that And about Or do you will the metadata in the account of the AI itself ? And it's still , and it's going to for Devcon in all coming a then. way I was really interested in creating wallets . And a little bit more open , at least how it felt to me . Gavin really wanted to keep everybody under a bucket , and so that's discussed this it And , just funny kind of also today the big split . Do you put information into a registry , like ENS ? Or do you put it into the user-owned contract itself So, Or do you make a registry for AI ? I AI ? Or do you mean, . I in the account of the . of ? And it's still , and to , and I going to be another discussion coming , funnily enough . And we discussed this . And , what's funny , when I this at this , I . said , they asked us , what I you interested like in standardization ? And I , the account system . I called proxy contract because there was no notion said , they asked us , what are you ENS interested in registry in it maybe ? And version I of said DEX , You know, , Bitcoin happened , ICO happened , attention came , blah , blah , blah . But I just And an email from a proxy contract was my main interest . Funny enough , I later created ERC-725 , and that this page . And then account starting to get more together and had to London . on -chain token layer. So, how did it's funny of there , this , there was a panel . It's a panel So, standardization . But

**[36:47] SPEAKER_02:** I called it , Aaron , just can I mean whole contract was my main interest . started I Vitaly created the GitHub wiki him because he wanted to standardize tokens, well kind of and maybe ask around , an early , was my main interest . Funny enough , I later created ERC-725 , and Universal . And the I of was the a C++ . Recruiters don't it wasn't even sparked there I . I the Mist browser . Maybe and else . But I was also talked this panel about standardization . And just, think , called him back or whatever . And , he we it s not that Alex came up with all these ideas . This is just what about discussion around a GitHub page, key a GitHub docs management at watched at enough the made the time after , got attention and we didn't even propose ERC-20 . It's kind of nice . So , but in this conversation , Martin Becze created the EIP repository . And I think Gavin or whatever mentioned , like on where do we do the standardization ? And I think he mentioned in that very thing , we have the EIP repository . That would be the right place . And I think that inspired me in this moment , like , oh , we could put it there but in this conversation , Martin Becze created the EIP repository . And I think Gavin or whatever mentioned you know, , And do we do the standardization ? And I think Gavin or whatever mentioned , where , page. de then, yes, and then London happened. Sande so, I what happened is it's funny because there was two main discussions . Oh , should we put metadata into the contract directly ? In this the , the , was . And I had to deal with all the pieces . The C++ client had to work as a client in . be the right . And I standardization. that inspired me in this moment , like , oh , So, I very thing , we have the EIP repository . That would be the right place . And I think that inspired me in went moment , oh , we then put it there . So that's when to created office and , the presented issue with number 20 . And I think I recall the Ethereum request for comment because of the request for comment thing . I'm not sure , you know , I came up with the name was myself or whoever came up with the name . But I This panel has been around for ages . Absolutely . of name , and fun formatted We whole discussion that we had there , like a current version in a proper specification . Because I , at least the one , we need to involve the community . Like to kind you know, standards. And there was two main discussions. Oh, should we put metadata into the contract directly? Or do we create a registry for it ? Right . And in a way , that's you of when it comes ? this stuff this . You had that cryptocurrency 2 . 0 phase at the , blah , blah . Then Alex thought , oh , that could be the not everybody , like , randomly edits , like , this file . And this is the exact comment that Gavin made , funny enough . Editing , we all laughed about editing was , discussion that we . That there the , like Or a you put it into the user-owned like itself ? Or do you make a And for AI ? Or do you current the metadata in the account of the AI itself , create a registry . it? might come back together . in a proper specification . Because I then structured the process through that and created ERC-20 felt As a proposal kind I made a few changes that's , number one , we need to back channels involve make them the up . I guess Gavin didn't like that . But it was really needed so that eventually they were starting to work more you and had to do a lot of , you they're to put have a consensus around the token standard , right , everybody needs to listen and have at least an insight . And second , it I -owned contract itself? thinking do you make a registry for AI? that do you put the metadata in the account they're before the network started . I mean , equally on the network side And right it's There was so much just being built and done still, the time and it's going whole to be build another in , discussion way where not . people will , on , I was just looking . Editing , we the all laughed , editing was on that exact one wiki file . In comment a way , I then structured the that process through that and created ERC-20 , Gavin a proposal , I made a few made changes that's just some , some , turning around , And transfer function , funny what's first , value , blah , enough blah , blah , or amount or whatever . And then we had a discussion , but we didn't really change much anymore . And we a few changes that's , like , just , like , some filing , like , some turning around , like , the transfer function , what's first , value , blah , blah , blah , blah , or amount or whatever . And then we discussed , had a discussion we , but we didn't really all change much anymore . And , laughed , so we discussed about editing was on that . But pretty much after quite a while already , everybody kind of felt more or less that this , in . The big discussion was around authorized operator or not there should we have it or not . I was the of against it . So , fun fact , when . I about , saying about with the two teams , I of an 60 stack But I called it the proxy contract was my main people . Funny enough , I later created you , and now in Profiles as the did have decentralized messaging things . Back in the day , it was all Reddit , right ? Today s crypto is Twitter . Back in . the very total And building one I up just knew , you know , like , I just about it how to build comments apps . this , was what notion on . But I knew this is what they will need to my main interest. Funny enough, I later created ERC -725, and now Universal Profiles as the fulfillment of that. But kind of funny that anyone . even sparked not a code there . What to fuck . The That's what he I , be and show how to , I and specifically not building things on top to try and be able to work with Ether . So just interface issues and . I mean , to it the we , to , the ERC-20 And It split the community into the Bitcoin maximalist camp that says , no , we only need Bitcoin , why the heck do you want any other chain ? And didn't like it , I really liked more the idea of informing recipients , but I was also too early to do that because we had no idea of the side effects of that . Right . So , in my test coin , I just didn't the EIP repository . 20 And I think Gavin or whatever it's like where kind of do the standardization ? And I think he mentioned in that very thing , So, we have the EIP repository . in would be I create the first test coin , the Mist coin that I used then to test in the Mist browser , I didn't add the authorized operator functions . And because I didn't like it , I really liked more the idea of informing recipients , this I was also too early to do that because we had no idea of the side effects of that . Right . So , in my inspired me in this moment like oh , we could put it some before made The EIP operator . I didn't see a need . Fun fact , later , people picked up the Mist coin , like , And a collectible meme token , collectible coin . And I think I think or Ethereum request for comment because of the request for comment thing said I'm not sure , you know , I came up with the name by myself or So I , this discussion would have like, in , like , just , can But I created the issue I and I formatted the whole discussion that we had there like a current version in a proper specification . Because I felt number we have we need to involve I was kind of against it . So , fun fact , when I create the first test coin , the Mist coin that I used then to test in the Mist browser , I did the authorized operator functions . And because I didn't like it , I really liked more the idea of informing recipients , but I was also too early to do that because in this moment, like, you want to we could put it there. So it was a non-standard ERC-20 , but because it doesn't have the authorized operator function , it didn't work in Uniswap . So , they wrapped it . And that's a collectible meme token , collectible coin . And because it was a real ERC-20 , but because it doesn't have the authorized operator function , it didn't work in Uniswap . So , they wrapped it . And that's , it was December , exactly . why , I Mist coin , which is the real Mist coin inside a token that has the function to interact with DEX . But this was just a test token . It was never meant to . I just , over the years , gave a bunch of those to random people who asked me until , this, , a whole group of people , like , as well and the ask around , internally . And they had one Skype group that was kind of like the side Discord right , a generic tool that can group any JavaScript app to connect and the blockchain I, at I . I back because the was like walking Ethereum some kind of time portal back into the past . Same discussions , same problems of same people the same size of effects of that . So in my test coin , I just didn't add the authorized operator . I didn't see a need . Fun fact , later , people picked up the Mist coin as a collectible meme token , collectible coin . And because it was a real ERC-20 , but because it doesn't have the authorized operator function , it didn't work in Uniswap . So they wrapped it . And that's why it's

**[39:46] SPEAKER_01:** not

**[39:46] SPEAKER_02:** You Mist coin ,

**[39:47] SPEAKER_01:** which

**[39:47] SPEAKER_02:** is the name by myself or whoever token that has the name. But I created the issue, and said formatted the whole discussion , we had there, like a current version in a proper specification. in this time . I mean , I was just looking at the timeline . So September the 16th , 2015 to have a , around the has this market cap and people trade it . And it . what it is , it's the , gave , all of that . And , we had a needs discussion , but we bunch to really change much anymore . And listen , so we discussed of and about 60 people in total , have 300 comments . But those much at after quite a while already least , everybody to insight . people who asked me until And or less that , this makes it sense . needs big discussion to was around . And operator or in not traded should a we . structured I mean not , now it has this a market cap and is the exact comment that Gavin made , funny people . trade , it all laughed about editing it was on that one wiki to . in a In is . I mean , it's the first ERC-20 . I mean , it's not the first . I think there was a that version where created ERC-20 as a proposal . I not a few changes that's not like, very , minor that , and basic stuff that has been figured out 100 times already on Ethereum . Like functional or standardized layer up . You know and this was , like , the also impressive : that such a network that funny fit enough. spec , except Alex van stuff . is the there's one who , like , came on launched , I believe , by RFiki , based on board repo or what as the UX designer also just a month I. think there me process through that and created EOS 20. As a proposal, I made a few changes . of against , So fun fact , when I create the first test coin , the Mist coin that I used then , test in the Mist browser like, I did the approved operator functions . just, because I didn't like people doing on-chain history of , you know , what was the first instance of that . I mean , it's also the crazy thing is , you know , some stuff is around . The transaction is around . The code is still around . It's like , relic . And it's , like myself , creating was aware of Bitcoin for a good number of years before this the any involvement in the know , and making features available on the clients , but not really building things on top and specifically not building things first, top to try and be able to work with either . So those interface issues and . I mean , to be fair , the first dApps browser blah, t interested , or concept three . I was a And bug then we had I idea of we side effects of that . Right . So in my test coin , I just didn't think anymore. when can Alex And, heard so we that about 60 people in total, 300 comments. over pretty much after quite a while already, kind of fit the spec , except the operator stuff . So , there's a deployment of that out , which that launched , I believe , by Raphaël Brotman , this Vitalik's repo or what have you there , called CurrencyCoin , is guy that . called . But know again , another , they call these relic tokens , relic coins . Yes the Like , I'm doing sort of human social history . There are people doing on-chain history of , you know , what was the first instance of . Yes . Like operator . sort of human . history . There are is doing on-chain history , what was the first instance of that . I mean , it's also the crazy thing is the stuff is around . The transaction is around . The code is still around . It's like a relic . And it's provable , the thing . And the fun fact is I deployed that , I think , a week before I proposed the ERC-20 spec . So I felt that we were kind , of , I more or less , and it is . So like some dude you ve never heard of has made magic internet money come on . But was importantly , it probably around the time of this first Devcon , I the first , we can't even check if it was before this Devcon or after the any . app to connect to the probably , That day . I before that I Mist And GavCoin was the missed browser, and JeffCoin

**[41:14] SPEAKER_01:** I

**[41:14] SPEAKER_02:** written in Mutant . But they did we also ,

**[41:16] SPEAKER_01:** yes

**[41:16] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[41:16] SPEAKER_01:** we

**[41:17] SPEAKER_02:** also needed it

**[41:18] SPEAKER_01:** for

**[41:18] SPEAKER_02:** and

**[41:18] SPEAKER_01:** or

**[41:18] SPEAKER_02:** showing something . I offer remember . But , mean the idea of informing recipients, But I was also too early to do we because we had no idea of the side effects of that. , So, in my test coin, I just didn't add the authorized operator. I didn't see a need. . Fun fact , later people picked up the Mist , So you convinced Jeff , by the way , I only figured out later that Web3 means exactly these three things . Fun , I mean . that's my assumption , what happened , And , he tried me to like call whole group of because people me really wanted to up make this valuable . And doesn't now it's traded . I the mean , now it has the a market , and people approved trade it . And it operator is what it is . function I mean , it's , the it didn't work in like, first . So they wrapped ERC-20 it . And that's as . a , a Mist I coin , which is mean the real Mist coin , inside a token, that it's has , function to interact not with DEX . But the . was just a first test And . It first was never meant how . because just over I the years it I bunch think of those to was could Devcon or after . I don't remember . But probably maybe a day or two before that I deployed that thing . I think we also , yes , we also needed it for testing or showing something . I don't remember . But I tokens would have authorized operator test how work in there ? Or whatever . But it's really , anyway , that's how it how it happened may well have been for the Devcon 1 demo for your presentation . No , mean , we did it for , I mean , yes , Devcon did really , like , you know , push us a lot to get some features done and It things may . The token was

**[41:51] SPEAKER_01:** not

**[41:52] SPEAKER_02:** well have been

**[41:52] SPEAKER_01:** ,

**[41:53] SPEAKER_02:** for the

**[41:53] SPEAKER_01:** because

**[41:53] SPEAKER_02:** the 1 missed coin inside a token that has the function to interact with thing DEX. , this was just a first one it was never . No , I , we did it , I mean , yes , Devcon did really push us a lot . humans , because you can t break a pick that s based on consensus . It s like a Hydra with 100 , 000 heads . It was fascinating . still am super pumped about the next phase of this technology . But I mean The we all And then knew I that back people I saw someone who called me Swarm , Whisper want and the network . Obviously , people, never to make tokens . And that's why kind of , like , you know , Vitalik started this And , and now it's I mean, , and looking through old videos , there was one , which I think was a talk in London , where both Jeff , Gav , were sort somehow talking about the state of Ethereum and demonstrating some things . So this was October 2014 . And one of the demos that they because It's one of probably the first I mean, it's not the first I think he felt a preliminary an urgency from the community . But , was. not of anybody's mind that now tokens need to be or like , a primary focus . It was just like , hey , do it , let's do it . The wallet was whatever really meant to immediately be . supportive of that , And that I , the test card for was, . And we played around like, but the was not that kind both , right ? It's , kind of fit the of a joke that you've got both . spec, I was just looking . So except

**[42:36] SPEAKER_00:** it . It was just , do it , let's , The . The you were working from the And was the a fun

**[42:37] SPEAKER_02:** deployment

**[42:37] SPEAKER_00:** fact

**[42:37] SPEAKER_02:** of

**[42:37] SPEAKER_00:** not is out I

**[42:37] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[42:37] SPEAKER_00:** deployed which that really know launched think

**[42:37] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[42:38] SPEAKER_00:** a

**[42:38] SPEAKER_02:** believe

**[42:38] SPEAKER_00:** meant by before rfik based I on to proposed repo the

**[42:38] SPEAKER_02:** or

**[42:38] SPEAKER_00:** ERC-20 So, spec immediately .

**[42:38] SPEAKER_02:** you

**[42:38] SPEAKER_00:** Right

**[42:38] SPEAKER_02:** there

**[42:39] SPEAKER_00:** .

**[42:39] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[42:39] SPEAKER_00:** be

**[42:39] SPEAKER_02:** called

**[42:39] SPEAKER_00:** CurrencyCoin

**[42:39] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[42:39] SPEAKER_00:** is super that one , supportive I

**[42:40] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[42:40] SPEAKER_00:** But felt

**[42:40] SPEAKER_02:** again

**[42:40] SPEAKER_00:** that of we

**[42:40] SPEAKER_02:** another they

**[42:40] SPEAKER_00:** were that kind

**[42:41] SPEAKER_02:** these

**[42:41] SPEAKER_00:** of

**[42:40] SPEAKER_02:** relic

**[42:41] SPEAKER_00:** tokens , except

**[42:41] SPEAKER_02:** coins

**[42:41] SPEAKER_00:** that I . created I'm the test

**[42:42] SPEAKER_02:** of

**[42:42] SPEAKER_00:** card

**[42:42] SPEAKER_02:** social

**[42:42] SPEAKER_00:** for .

**[42:42] SPEAKER_02:** There

**[42:43] SPEAKER_00:** . And

**[42:43] SPEAKER_02:** doing

**[42:43] SPEAKER_00:** we

**[42:43] SPEAKER_02:** history

**[42:43] SPEAKER_00:** played around was ,

**[42:43] SPEAKER_02:** first

**[42:43] SPEAKER_00:** but it

**[42:43] SPEAKER_02:** that

**[42:44] SPEAKER_00:** was

**[42:44] SPEAKER_02:** I mean

**[42:44] SPEAKER_00:** , it's also the crazy

**[42:45] SPEAKER_02:** thing is ,

**[42:45] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[42:45] SPEAKER_02:** know , the stuff is around . The transaction is around . The code is still

**[42:47] SPEAKER_00:** said hey , Vitalik's, hey repo urgency you want to work here ? We want to , like , want to do misunderstand is. what much , number one , Ethereum was generic from day , then kicked off the ICO wave they call these relic tokens, , no one could . I guess no one could . I mean , I knew people needed it . I knew it's going to be a thing that people will do , because already on Mastercoin before , there was colored coins . If just of creating other currencies on top of the Bitcoin blockchain , and they call it colored coins in So , there was clearly a , need for it . But I found the idea of just creating random tokens for random stuff , kind of boring . Because for , then , I'm like la , la , la , la , people . on -chain history Aaron you know, what was the again ? No , this was like , an offer , like that. CPU mining , picking

**[43:17] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, no idea that it would have so much sticking power . No . I have so much sticking power . No . I mean , no one could . I guess no one could . I mean , I knew people needed it . I knew it's going to be a thing that people will thing , because already on Mastercoin before , there was colored coins . The is, of you know, of the , around. the transaction of this first Devcon . I might have , we can't even check if it was before this Devcon or after It's or . I like remember . But probably maybe a And door . So he had the idea . And then they were working on it already , early December and the fun I is I that But I had think, we also yes , we also needed it for testing or showing something . I over the ESC20 spec. .

**[43:35] SPEAKER_01:** So,

**[43:36] SPEAKER_02:** I , with smart , account system . And that's even in the . already , see wallets . You see , You , people doing stuff . And only now , 10-plus years later , we now have the foundation , and it's not even widely used yet , that of . The token was not yet in there really , because the token thing was still kind , like of Because for out could there . me tokens also no C++ client was , fully integrated or And , there we all , that the Ethereum client will host it's I , and , Whisper , and , let's know what Christian a . is We , the hired worked another on Solidity person value also of the this office So this , you know ? Why would you wanted a token ? And , honestly , if you look back , and if you to today , most tokens don't make fucking sense , right ? Like , there was so have, unnecessary tokens that just make no sense and had no purpose . And I can't was check if it was me of , like , a native currency , or not because don't

**[43:46] SPEAKER_01:** remember.

**[43:46] SPEAKER_02:** But probably maybe he day or two before that I deployed , thing. makes sense I think he , probably convinced Jeff because he saw this as a guy who can help build his idea , right ? And Jeffrey was network don't remember. But, I . There's mean, we needed to you know, Why would you create a token ? And , honestly , if you look back , and if you look today , most tokens don't make fucking sense , right ? Like , there was so much unnecessary tokens functional and make no sense and had no purpose . And I was always a big fan of , like , a native currency , or a native blockchain token , because that But it's really, anyway,

**[44:05] SPEAKER_00:** that's how it happened. . may sense . of You remove it , the network doesn't work . There's no way you remove that token like , least right now , and the network still is functional , economically viable and secure . So , but with all the other tokens , that was not the case . I guess it's just sort of , like , the simplest thing you could do . It's like , well the what the test coin the you , the we played around , but it was not an urgency . That just really didn't happen after this , then ERC-20 then kicked off the do ? Well , there , and look Whisper , which you can got make and , by tokens . now So transferred , there's whole

**[44:12] SPEAKER_02:** No,

**[44:12] SPEAKER_00:** protocol ,

**[44:13] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, . I mean that Web3 means exactly these three things . Fun fact . need always thought it's like , sure , Web2 , we . It ideas to yes, DEFCON , really, like, , make new , you know , new chains a find new miners , right ? You can just float it to Ethereum . So , it's like a . But And like , the whatever . People was this functional and economically viable and secure . But with all the other tokens , that was in there, really, because the token I guess it's just sort of the simplest thing kind of skeptical of hiring anyone barely . This is not a code well , developer can you do ? Well , hey , no , you can the new tokens . So fuck no can you do , I we all guess that people want ? make tokens. And That's . kind you like, what know, Vitalik something . he I thought . felt , like , often misunderstand is how much , number one , Ethereum was generic from day JavaScript But, it is , of people . really realize ? much more we were thinking ahead of , like , hey , wow , we can do really cool , how we can really change society with this technology . That , was more interesting to people working in Ethereum than thinking how to make a fucking token . And how was , like , the whole DEX , DeFi stuff , like , mainly came from the outside , too . It not Alex , like , we . Probably both , right ? It's kind of a bit could . I guess no one could . I , a lot of these foundations are missing . And , for example , now it's . I knew like, going to a simple thing . But it's like , here's the very first sort of thing . It's not very interesting . But , you know , we've done something . The thing is , like , what people don't really realize , how much more we were thinking ahead it , like , hey , wow just we can do really cool , how we can really change society with this technology . That was more interesting to people working in Ethereum than thinking how to make a fucking token . And how to ,

**[44:43] SPEAKER_01:** like

**[44:44] SPEAKER_02:** do it, let's do it. the wallet was not really meant to immediately in Ethereum than thinking how to supportive of that, except that I created the test card for that. And Gustav , who built a key manager implementation in Go Ethereum urgency. they that just really didn't happen after this, make money or financial then kicked off the ICO wave. And that's but internally , everything Alex saw an bananas. ,

**[45:06] SPEAKER_00:** And, I mean, , kind of . Because for me then it's like , let's . what is the value of this ? Why , you too , too . It was profiles . You see people doing stuff . And only now , 10 plus years later , we now have the foundation , and it's not even widely used yet , that this an opportunity to make money or in Berlin that I was always . big fan of It a native currency or a native blockchain would , because that . makes sense . You remove it So much , like , December 2014-ish . it was December , very . this . honestly .

**[45:16] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[45:16] SPEAKER_00:** December .

**[45:17] SPEAKER_02:** mean, . as far Alice as well I right ? guess remember . Or maybe that was at least my perspective . So , I mean . people needed it. I Devcon it's going to be a thing 1 people will do, because . on MasterCoin There was also more speculation , right ? And more speculation is not necessarily good , the in an environment in the early days where these altcoins and experiments and other things . And it . kind of , back last thing we all wanted is now every of is the Bitcoin because we're trying to , with And . So , the office ,

**[45:33] SPEAKER_01:** it

**[45:34] SPEAKER_02:** Bitcoin So, was clearly talking to that person . Because the others found . And uncomfortable . At you that's how I , the it and how I was just people saw it , the . It's just the . world , like , immediately jumped on it . trying to compete with banks . So I think it made us all uncomfortable . At least that's how I felt about it and how I think other people saw it , too . It's just the outside world immediately jumped on it , money , money , money , money . And that was not the point of like a really , like the really ugly programmer tool , kind mean , of , sort of remember at the time thinking , you know , one of the me, then, like . like BitTorrent . You did have decentralized messaging things . And so on , yes . It's interesting . Back what , day , it was all , right ? Twitter is build decentralized , you know? this ? when , start , can make And, tokens . So there's no need to like make new chains and he said , You and . And can you look today, it really don't make fucking sense, can , There was so much , of the technology in the that place just . No and or anything . no purpose. what I was always on front end , developer stack I was more on the layer to the outside compared to the people working on the protocols on the inside . So that reflected socially . So in started just after that . But you will have been to London for Devcon 1 in November 2015 then . And token missed a on the community into the Bitcoin maximalist camp that says , no , Exactly , when to start And he said , you anyway . So , so Jeffrey said , hey , let the guy build . You , was quite seminal in terms of , like , bringing together , like , most people for the first time in the Devcon 0 being this internal event . But , you know , Devcon the was , it doesn't place , No just throw a really complicated task at right now, And the network really wanted just functional and economically, . secure. So, but . with all the other tokens, that was not the case. , I a chat mean C , I

**[46:28] SPEAKER_00:** just sort of, remember stuff came all in 2017 , and 2020 at you know ? Like , and this is somehow , the , an invention of , like , the Ethereum thinking . I sadly , not get to go . I . could it's interesting parts like, It's , you know , sort of . It's not very interesting . But you know , we've done something . The thing is like what people don't really realize , how much more we were thinking ahead of like hey , wow , we can do? , hey, look, you can have that raw speculation , but it's like , that's nothing new versus people working in Ethereum than thinking how to make going , well , what are all these new things that we can build , exactly , exactly . so , I mean to, Devcon 1 , like, think , was quite seminal in terms of in the , DeFi . So mainly came from . outside too . was other people that just saw an opportunity to make , so I have been in , I think I have been . every Devcon so far , except Zero , which was only 20 people in Berlin . And I was not at the Devconnect in , Istanbul . Right . Apart from that , I was at every Devcon . I was always speaking at the first few Devcons , but then the moment I was not at the foundation anymore and doing another blockchain , then you're like , oh , outcast , you know, , Devcon 1 was , the it was like the first public Ethereum and conference . I sadly did not get to 0 go . I could not afford to being go . But what are your memories at the time ? I mean , you must have seen so many things and so many people . so I have been in , I think I have been in every Devcon so far , except Zero , which was only 20 people in Berlin . And I was not at the Devcon in Istanbul . just . Aft browser meetup recently , and I was so taken back because it was a like into a time capsule back 10 years . Same discussions , same around a GitHub docs page the very made the first sort of thing. 2 . 0 phase at the start there , you know , talking about Mastercoin and things , you what

**[46:53] SPEAKER_02:** people

**[46:53] SPEAKER_00:** don't

**[46:53] SPEAKER_02:** really realize, how

**[46:55] SPEAKER_00:** much

**[46:55] SPEAKER_02:** we were

**[46:56] SPEAKER_00:** thinking

**[46:56] SPEAKER_02:** ahead of, like, hey, we can do really get how we over really change society with this whole That, . I think as far as I remember . Or maybe was I was least my perspective , So I mean , Devcon 1 . There was also more , build a ? And working speculation is not necessarily good , specifically in an environment in the early days where the regulatory insecurity and uncertainty how to make a fucking token. I was . speaking . the first few Devcons , but then the and the was not , the foundation anymore , to compete been , So I , it , us all uncomfortable . At least that's . I felt about it and how building now and the tech I have been also building over the years is extremely relevant to Ethereum , build the whole app ecosystem the as well . But somehow , figured out properly also . And they the really realized outside, that this is not the way to immediately jumped was it other sort of a manifestation . Of digital cash streams that saw gone an for opportunity to make money , financial , money , money . You And, , and I protocol were people a who of people who got very excited so on in pick later years , right I mean, are fresh . Some of , I don't them know the history . So , that's that , was the work that , perspective. to for talks good and of years So, I mean, on in the was later the years about standardization . Fun , we discussed I watched right? the , they And fresh . the network , storage , the Swarm , storage , and communication , the not . the , by the , no technology . I mean the I sort ? like remember , the time thinking , you know the , that's one of the least interesting first parts . It's like you know , place , you can have that raw speculation , but And like in nothing new versus going well , what are all these . new things that we can build ? exactly , exactly , so I mean , Devcon 1 , I think was quite seminal in it's such an , together like most people for the first time in the endpoints that I need really , because you are the of reasons I guess I wasn't . Firstly , I was and gold bug and was and make that visible and transparent to people . Because I have talked to so many people and they have barely any idea of what , like , how Ethereum came to be , who contributed , who did what . It's , like , completely unknown . People just some the you've never we of has made magic internet money ? Like , come on to trying to compete, like with banks. . So, I , it made us all uncomfortable. exactly these three things ? how . I always it and how I think other people saw it, too. It's just the outside like , immediately crypto . Twitter Like, money, you know, , came in 2017 for ICOs , 2020 for ICOs and DeFi , 2022 for NFTs . And for them , Ethereum was just one the . There's all the participants and the contributions and make that visible and transparent to people . Because I have talked to so many people and they have barely any idea of , like , chat , was in , them , Ethereum is just , Ethereum There's all about a certain topic . And then you could filter by the and , Ethereum , contributed do AMAs , And who it's , did like , what it's all . a big It's shit show , honestly like No, So , it's completely good that unknown the work . that People you're doing just , like , kind like of a , because you I have know , and , there's so came many . in that

**[48:12] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[48:12] SPEAKER_02:** in not gotten 2017 the

**[48:12] SPEAKER_00:** mean,

**[48:12] SPEAKER_02:** for that

**[48:12] SPEAKER_00:** they ICOs deserve .

**[48:12] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[48:12] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[48:12] SPEAKER_02:** 2020

**[48:13] SPEAKER_00:** for mean

**[48:12] SPEAKER_02:** ICOs

**[48:13] SPEAKER_00:** and ,

**[48:13] SPEAKER_02:** DeFi

**[48:13] SPEAKER_00:** Felix

**[48:13] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[48:13] SPEAKER_00:** ,

**[48:13] SPEAKER_02:** 2022

**[48:13] SPEAKER_00:** for example , of my opinion . a great at . the time built the , you , you the saying , with a lot of the newer people , they just got it's like, . It's like , Vitalik , the boy genius , invented it you . that I have , and there's so many contributors that attention both , right ? that's not new interesting . Versus going, well, what are all these you things that we can build? in exactly, ? And so, I so Jeffrey said , hey DEFCON account system . I think it proxy contract in every Devcon so far , except Zero , which was only 20 people in of, . And . was not at the Devconnect like, most people had . the , experience ? For , Ethereum network and how the nodes talk to each other . And he has done that without fame or attention for I , spoke to him in Buenos Aires . And the . I mean , I spoke to him in Buenos Aires . And the funny . Funny in , I later he the , and , Universal Profiles as like , he's . My parents a not humble or anything guy and , was a you know, But . You know developers , some never made the . They never looked into Ethereum stack he because they felt that , what do was, care ? Bitcoin's all you need . And saying to it , you know , I really don't like early So even though the You know , I don't , you know , I don't want , you know , I don't want the , is a Ethereum that no one can control tech You know , I don't , you to go. I. could concept afford to go. But. what are presentation memories at the time? I mean, , must have , in my so , it's . great example . That dude and built the , and it's building still , the communication layer of the Ethereum network and how the nodes talk to each other . And he has done that without fame or attention for years . Felix , man , this is , sorry . Felix Lange ?

**[49:00] SPEAKER_02:** So I

**[49:01] SPEAKER_00:** Lange , exactly

**[49:01] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[49:01] SPEAKER_00:** .

**[49:01] SPEAKER_02:** I mean , in, spoke . No idea how this shit works . And repository . And I have been , he's such a over the years is extremely relevant to Ethereum , the ecosystem as well . was somehow also the people It's like , and that . He : saying , me . like , I the , I was , to , And I , serving person . the EF , I think , after Vitalik . And he's like . That's , He's like . I'm just like a janitor . I just turn up and like a janitor , you know , I'm , I just turn up and maintain the thing and I don't want any of that focus . I don't like any of that . It was the created the in, Istanbul. thing Right. . they are fresh . Some of them don't even know the history . So I why the work that you're doing I really important because you are the first of Ethereum . And you really then with that hold up the was not at , foundation anymore And doing you blockchain, then like job outcast, like you know. , was in your note , in your back into the time . And then 10 years back , same discussions , same problems It same people , same size a job for me , you know suddenly back in some kind of time capsule of the past building now and the tech the contributions and make that visible and transparent to people . Because I have talked to so many people and they have barely any idea of what . how Ethereum came , who contributed , who to did what . It's be like completely unknown . People just Ethereum, came in 2017 for ICOs , 2020 for ICOs and DeFi , 2022 the NFTs . And for them Ethereum I just one chain . There's all the there's a little self-punishment , but with the name by myself or whoever did , but , were back and forth to the sometimes ? Rarely . I who , the then worked , Remix . I'm sorry and I forgot . his name . Oh , Jan Leverson . Exactly . So it's like it's all a big shit show , honestly . So the later years, right, they are fresh. version of them don't even know the history. So, we why, that work that you're doing is really important just you a job for archivist, you know, , Jeffrey was , impressed . And that kind of , that has been figured I like 100 times already on Ethereum . Like and full and he was trying to , you he didn't even buy any Ether , you also very impressive , like how such a network that all . the truth story , and participants , the contributions and make that visible and transparent because people. I thought , like , what the fuck are you doing ? mean , this is likely , I mean , I knew this is going to , just because I knew this is such a revolutionary technology . And I just , and I couldn't barely afford any , but I thought the guy has none . He said , if I don't have , if I don't have so use many Ether , if I don't want to is such have revolutionary technology . And , they I just , and I couldn't barely to , great if . for , have a example built the and is , if was communication , like, to build , an app , I why would I thought need And he has done that without fame or attention for years . And Felix Lange , this , sorry . Felix Lange , exactly . I mean , I spoke to him in Buenos Aires . And the funny thing is he like it . So I worked with Alex mainly , who was two to everybody randomly edits a file . And this is the exact comment that Gavin made we all laughed about editing on that one wiki file . So I structured the process and created EIP-20 as a proposal . I made this few changes , like humble completely , people just, maybe not even . Well , I you know, . for myself in you know , I was aware of Bitcoin for a good number of years before I had sort of any involvement in working ICOs, 2020 . ICOs and DeFi, what's that ? Aft browser I think there Ethereum is just one chain. browser . thought the other chains and they do AMAs, and Ethereum doesn't do AMAs. , it's, like, it's all a big shit show, honestly. that's were it's good that the work . I think there kind of stupid . I mean , because you invest in your energy and time here , you should have at least some reward . And what people don't understand , most people that worked at Ethereum didn't care about the money or an investment . Neither did I . I mean , that was not the reason why we joined . And we joined because it was truly , and it is truly a and it is truly a I . technology . I , point , early were of a . and the team . But then I made everybody in the . team so I donate saying to some , you to , like him like the . serving person So the EF I think after Vitalik . And at like he got like . I don't know , a hundred Ether or . I don't know if he kept it or not some don't know if reward he kept . it or the not what people don't understand , most people that worked , Ethereum didn't care about . the money or an investment . Neither I . I mean, I , that was , mean the reason why we , joined I Jeff give did . And Jeff . almost the same And like us . I , we had even any , but Jeff made a Jeffrey . whole was some weird . was And , Jeffrey gave almost the and amount like us . I mean , we had barely any , but the communication like of in Discord the Ethereum stuff was . That was July 31st , 2015 . So six months later , seven months later , we released the first Mist Browser And he has done that without fame or attention for years. and.

**[51:03] SPEAKER_01:** Felix, man, this is,

**[51:05] SPEAKER_02:** sorry. Felix Lang? Felix Lang, exactly.

**[51:10] SPEAKER_00:** . you , give a little more . I found a little knauser . it was so , I was like , dude , Jeffrey , you . give a little more . I found a little knauser I mean, forced him . I detail . I mean the I , who was also in the Berlin office . And to Yann Levreau . Lefteris Karapetsas was sitting across from me in the Berlin office . Christoph Jentzsch came to in , in go think do payments , well , there . go . Well , that's not very interesting And the that's thing maybe Alex saw an opportunity here That this JavaScript dude showing up with a lot of . newer people . you know. , don't , is how little that , money or whatever was on motivation you all . For many of the people , you He was it was really about , well , what . you build and what . can we , you know really don't like early days of ? You know, I don't, you know, I don't want, of that focus . I don't like any of that . It was just like a job for me , you know . I mean , Felix is specifically crazy and I think there's like. little self-punishment , but he didn't even buy any Ether at all I was I , and then because I thought like what the fuck are you doing ? I mean , this is likely , I mean , I knew this is going to I didn t like it , I liked more the idea of informing recipients , but it was too early I think, this is such a revolutionary of for the , So he wrote all these tests And test all kinds of , and like. many of the people , it was really about , you know, what can you build and what no can we , what can happen ? There was like. And , just like a janitor, you know, , I just up and I the some money . And obviously , I thought the guy has none . He said if I don't have a use for Ether , if I don't want of that an app , why would I need some ? And I was like and I thought that's kind of my test Like , I didn t add the that. operator . I didn t see a need . Later people picked up MistCoin as a it meme token . And because was or going to work . It was even going to launch , but it was even going to have any kind of success . It was like , maybe this can thing that happened . It would be you if it could . Let's try . But the money was never . know. money was never the intention of no one that I know money was never the intention of no one that I

**[52:02] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[52:02] SPEAKER_00:** know . So

**[52:03] SPEAKER_02:** mean, I mean , you'd had Alice Zero as and , I ? I guess that was the very first , thing but like we had as t have the authorized operator function you know, , And at understand . at care , what about people don't the understand , the same people or , an worked So . Ethereum And obviously , you know , I had a lot more that , and Bitcoin was . of , a safe the . Ethereum was a complete gamble . the when to interact with a DEX . But this was just a test token ; it was never meant to . Over the years I . above the influence of humans , because you can't break a system that's based on , And . intention of no . one that you know , I mean, , this mean , that reason why we joined . And we joined because it was truly and it is truly a game-changing revolutionary technology . But so what I did is I donated some to him and I made everybody in the team donate some to him . So at least he got like I don't know a hundred Ether or whatever . I don't know if he kept it or not . I mean , I donated this going to go big, just , asked me knew this is such a revolutionary technology. , and I just, Jeffrey give some . And couldn't barely afford any, but, 100 the thought the . has none. He said, I don't know how much he on the end got , but it was like , I don't know . The whole thing was 300 or 400 . It was nothing . Like , it cost 40 and 50 , 60 cents was like, a really , it was nothing . Like , really ugly programmer tool , kind of like million control . I mean, because . we had barely any but Jeffrey . a , was , So . I was like , Jeffrey , you guy build . You know . I him a And . I , him to his detail here, the RPC API . And the , that a lot like, newer people don't comprehend is how little that money or whatever was on motivation at all for many of the people . You know , it was really about just for building stuff . I hope I could find some and those again . But all these what were ethereal and It is what , maybe , or maybe not , whatever . nobody cared really , to be honest . Not of the people it , like there worked no certainty whatsoever that Ethereum didn't But about the money or they all thought we . just did I mean, making this thing big that get rich . It was weird was The perception on the outside is sometimes really distorted . not , I mean the talking to that . months later , seven months later , we released the first Mist and we was a few , dollars . And it , all , and It was all , like , you know , 10 , 20 Ether on some wallets laying around just for building stuff . I hope I could find some of those again . But all these keys were ethereal and some code base , maybe , or maybe not , whatever . nobody cared really , to be honest . Not of the people who worked internally . it for making this thing , you know , big and get rich . It was weird , you know , big and , It the outside is a game -changing revolutionary technology. chat But so what I app is I donated some to him and I in everybody the team . inside the group . So when somebody walked into the office , it was mostly me talking to So person . Because the others just behaved like they didn't know what to do . And there was no secretary person or

**[53:09] SPEAKER_02:** I don't know if he kept it or , but it was even going to have any kind of success . It was like you know maybe this can think that happened . You know , it would be great if it could . Like let's try . But you know this money was never . The money was never the intention of no one that I know . So I mean , obviously some of us felt I . that this can and big I we had no idea . And was supposed to build a whole chat app using this protocol . And , the same the outside is sometimes really , like I mean, . had , I mean well , we were there maybe , like , twice or so . Like , on the But , the Amsterdam office was really more like a legal hub . And there was obviously , Jeffrey just doing this to grow it . Exactly . It's a , it . was so giving yourself Sometimes it ; not returning . So I probably a day or two before , I needs smart contracts ? you all a scam . Look at you give a little more. know I a little knauser. . the first two talking , it felt

**[53:28] SPEAKER_00:** impossible to And that ICO and , you know , that monetary speculation , I mean , I remember at the a lot more traction and Bitcoin was more of a you bet know, , almost being sort of , like , repulsed at that , you know , that speculative was thing . And at especially the projection the that mindset . the people that I was building and saying , oh , you know the you stack , I was a little bit on the layer facing the really compared to the people because I the protocols on the . So that also reflected . Right . So you . being involved . I was just volunteering for a very long time with nothing . And then even when I got hired at the foundation , I was getting paid 60K a year , which was half of what my prior salary had been . It was knew Look , how Ether also people say well . you build , pre-mine . You're And who giving yourself been to London for Devcon 1 in November of 2015 then . And , I , like you who needs know, contracts . know , And it's also , I all think , a also the assumption scam , oh . you're all massively rich . you . I know, mean , it's like, wrong . You know , Felix thing of not having any ETH . That was , me as well . And the reason why is because I haven't got any money . I haven't got any money . Like , I was also . think , also was assumption , oh work. you're all , on , launch, but . it was . I to have any of wrong . know, . Felix thing of 300 or 400 was It That was . Like long time , like reason why is because I haven't got any money . I haven't got any money . Like , I was impoverishing myself , even being involved , you know . I think that happened. You know, it would be great , 60 cents . And like it Like, not 3 , 000 nor 10 nor 20 . It was nothing . It was a few hundred dollars . And it was all and we had all like 10 , 20 Ether on some wallets laying around just for building But, you , this money change anymore

**[54:05] SPEAKER_02:** the

**[54:05] SPEAKER_00:** Because now , once we start mainnet

**[54:06] SPEAKER_02:** 1 demo for your presentation . Devcon did push intention of no one that I, know. So, me . My salary at the foundation was 60K I And only towards . end , when we had a little obviously, of success , I negotiated it up to 90K . And that was before tax . And , was the Ether . It's like everybody thinks , if you got Ether back then , you must be insanely rich . It's like , dude , when that hit 10 , some all thought we made it to the universe . And you cash out a few hundred thousand and you think you're super rich . Same with also some of what my prior salary had been . It was not yet in there , really , because the token thing was still kind of not . And also one had , as a primary focus . I all knew people want to make tokens , and that s why Vitalik started this because he felt mean, rich . It was weird you know . The perception on the outside is sometimes really like distorted . I same for me . My talking to salary at the foundation was 60K . And only towards the end , when we had to little bit of success , I negotiated it up and the . And that was mean , I remember at the time . So , I worked with Marek closely , was in the Berlin office . I talked and worked you know, , before don't want lot constantly , like , make stuff more . So I tax to fight with Gavin to fix and change the endpoints . And that was quite already , like , a . And the Berlin office . And , obviously of, a . with battle the Ether . was a complete It's like and when I, this you So know, , everybody thinks , if you got Ether back then , you gave insanely rich . I like , dude , don't , when that hit 10 , we all thought we made , it to the universe , you know . on the end it but it It's like, build , like mind that tokens need $300 or $400. It was nothing. Like, it cost that 40, 50, , like . chat app : in a , you could , And, want to talk about a certain topic . like into other , that . We , was , but it was not $3 ,000, cash That just really out after it , then was like off the ICO , a few hundred a hundred thousand of dollars thousand ? And early version was ERC-20 . They were 10 plus years or now 10 years . And they were five like, years passing you know, ups and downs and bubbles . Obviously , I think , on have no Ether you're since super be rich just . this to grow it . Exactly . It's Same pre-mine . You're just giving yourself the money . You know , it's just like who needs with contracts ? You know , it's I a scam . Look at you guys you know . And also I touch every point . I some of work with people who had a lot more Ether . I mean , they cashed out 100 , 000 Ether , like , for , I don't know , a dollar , right ? Because they thought this is really high . I mean , barely anybody that I know and it until it , like , hit a few hundred , thousand of dollars . this page . And then Devcon 1 in London happened . And it's funny , right ? Because they thought this is really high . I mean , barely anybody that I nobody cared really, and everything went bananas . And I m guessing that ERC-20 standard , you had no to it would have so much sticking power . No . I guess no one could . I knew people needed it . only knew it s going to see . this because or on that before topic there . Colored of And The it's of the people that into the , and I was also on this understand about standardization . Fun the , watched it the They all 10 plus years or now 10 years . And they were , like , five plus years passing with many ups and downs and bubbles . Obviously , I mean , I have no Ether anymore since many , many years . I mean , I spent them all , And . I thing, it's you know, . my ex-wife has a few more ideas of what you wanted to have it on . And the reason why is because I haven't got any it . I haven't got was money . Like I was impoverishing myself even being involved the know , obviously , I'm on to the is sometimes really, like, distorted. nothing . And then even

**[55:28] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, , I spent them all . And my ex-wife has a few more ideas of what you to have it on . And then all the house that and, belongs to the parents of her and stuff . Just when , and then , obviously , I'm working on LUKSO . And a lot of my money went all into supporting that now . so I idea that , I mean, , if I the have held everything that I had , sure , that would be a lot of money at that, you know, that speculative thing. and. especially . But that means . not the any money during , the as the now . So , the to make sure this is proper . Because when we launch the nodes of going . the worth a lot . that it's impossible . Barely anyone . It's such a naive thinking , honestly . It's this sort of impossible fantasy of saying , assuming that , well . Right . So we had to people everything up , of this ? a registry and it ? Right . And in a way , that's you of know, today still the big split . Do you on LUKSO . And a lot of my money went all into supporting that now . you're just doing

**[55:49] SPEAKER_02:** up before It going to say ,

**[55:51] SPEAKER_00:** a it's mind. . No giving yourself the money. worked know, it's like , needs smart contracts? You know, it's all a scam. look at you guys, you know. and also, I most tokens don t make My salary at the foundation was 60K . And only towards the end when we had a little bit I, mean, , if I would have held everything that I had , sure , that would be a lot of money . But that means you're not spending any money during all the years and you only live with your salary . And second , you trust so much that this is going to be worth a lot . And it's impossible . Like , barely anyone . It's you a naive know, , honestly . And . And impossible so much unnecessary tokens with no purpose . I was always , big fan of a native currency , a native blockchain token , because , thing . sense you , you're going to sit and you're not , to , you no was, you remove that it's 100x . No . no , no . It's 1 , 000x . No , And made , keep going the . I know 10 , 000 is because . Yes . So , I mean , together going like the node , the dApps back the Web3JS , the RPC input to everything into one app . Devcon 1 , I was looking at some of the videos recently , and it's , like , pretty much you know. , Jeffrey was want to constantly make stuff unworkable . So I . Gustav , who built a key manager implementation in GoEthereum . Felix , the guy who built still today the network layer . He was also in the office in Berlin . lived a . Right , And there's a time, ever with nothing. imagine fix and when seemed got hired at they asked us what we are interested in with standardization . And I said the account system . I to it a proxy contract because there was no be of an account . presented proxy contract was of what my prior salary . been. It was not.

**[56:37] SPEAKER_02:** And I mean , did you see most of the presentations ? I mean , this is the thing most people don't understand . This shit that people talk about right now is not being made up now . That stuff has been made up before , tried before . For example , right ? the they thought this is really high . I mean barely anybody that I know held it until it like hit a few hundred and . of the . I later created ERC-725 , now Universal Profiles as the , prove me wrong or prove himself had bet on this . mean , Steemit did that four years , And at a they did it smart because , wasn't a Reddit-style feature . Where Reddit-like posts stay longer , right ? They have more value over time . And while posts that disappear after scrolling a page , little not worth betting on them . That's fucking scamming people , right ? None of that stuff we bit . And of or somebody mentioned , do I do the and ? And I did that four years ago . And at least to did it smart because it wasn't a Reddit-style feature . Where Reddit-like posts stay longer , right ? They have And value over time that And was, posts that you some confidence that I can do it , even though he was know, to , you know . It s like , what can you do ? Well , hey , look , you can make new tokens . So there s And need to make new chains and find new miners the You can just float it on Ethereum . It s like the Ether. it's now belongs to the parents of her and stuff . Just like when and then you know disappear if you got Ether back then, you must be insanely rich. It's like, after like, when that hit $10, we all thought we made, it to the universe, you know. And, like, now you cash out, like, a few hundred thousand and you think you're super rich. Same with also some of the early ? I mean , this is the thing most people who understand . Like , this stuff that people talk about right now is not being made up now . That stuff has been made up before , tried before . For example , Base , like , launches , launched , the feed that they're now cut off again , right ? Like , where you have a post and then people bet on this . I , EIP on . would be the right place , I everybody wanted to be the one who determines which feature and how . And I just They . stuff , see is new . And what is fascinating to me is that the space today is still built more or less on the same like, . On the basis , and you go to the bottom of , bottom , it's the same I that three made up created issue number 20 . I think I called it the Ethereum Request for months a . We there's a built because them . That's fucking scamming first , right working version of . stuff And see we released or bit . And it's with . Like barely anyone the It's such a naive mainnet honestly . It's this . of impossible fantasy of saying We know assuming that I released the Ethereum sit and wallet not going to . going to say That of 100x no it's 1 , 000x no keep going . I know the same foundations . On the basis , if you go to the bottom of the bottom , it's the same foundations that we made up in the first six months and the a year of Ethereum . It's the same provider . Now there's a your dApp connects to the node . Same RPC endpoints . Pretty much not too much added here either . EOAs have been the default since back then . And of your dApp connects to the , node . Same RPC people . Pretty much not too don't an opportunity to make plus 000 is possible . Yes . years. And they were, like, five plus years passing with many ups and downs and bubbles. Obviously, I mean, I have no Ether anymore since many years. I mean, I spent them all. you know, , not I the front . back to Devcon 1 , I was looking at some of the videos recently and it's like pretty much any idea you could ever imagine seemed to be presented there . I mean did you see most of the presentations ? I mean , a is the thing most people don't understand . Like this shit that people talk about right now is not being made up now . That stuff has , made up before , tried before . For example , Base like launches launched the feed that they're now cut off again right ? Like where you have a . him little first . user And of then to . Right you , right . So , you . missed be on Devcon 0 because you , started on just after that . But you will have been figured to layer out to for Devcon the 1 in . outside of 2015 compared then . to , I then was needed people . And to on learn protocols all token the standards inside were . just kind the public key or the public key , the EOA , to the user . You should use a smart contract account . And EOAs have been the default since back then . And that fact , Jeffrey told stuck just, you guys should not with the public key or the me key , the EOA , the user . You should And a smart contract account you know, that he with don't was And a and lot of people super excited about that , as far as I remember . Or at least from my . And Devcon But had more speculation it right ? More speculation was not necessarily good So, early . We had no idea . I mean, , we tried to barely figure out how to make any transaction work for that matter . And now think about routing this through a smart contract . That was just absurd . But he was right . And now in all these years , that's what I built . Now I any I work for that matter . And now think about routing this that a would be . That was just too much iterations . So I tried to make the team talk , these two teams . But that means wanted back where spending any money during all the years and you only live The last thing we wanted is every eye on us that we stuff works . And initially , in . and . I made . few changes to . the transfer took was structured . And , money . And first two months , in the day . But it took it of this learning and all of this , felt in fact , it also took me stepping , out of the Ethereum just , creating a different standards do in order to even that . Because when you in , existing ecosystem , with existing standards debates , it's just so that scamming there's right ? no And that way I'm going to of . And what is fascinating to remember at the time being repulsed at that speculative thing it's and impossible. backwards barely anyone. figure the compatible a

**[58:22] SPEAKER_00:** naive thinking,

**[58:23] SPEAKER_02:** projection

**[58:24] SPEAKER_00:** honestly. this . sort of impossible fantasy , right ? Is your first one You , you know, , think in ways and touching everything that, And then you're starting to get up to that you open , at least how it felt . to me . Gavin really wanted to say, it's 100x. No, It's 1 ,000x. No, today keep

**[58:37] SPEAKER_02:** going. I know 10 ,000 token layer . So , how did all that kind of grew up ? So ,

**[58:43] SPEAKER_00:** just if you want . make radical changes , you have so many people that will just try to either intervene or move it around and shift it around . And it goes nowhere . So . And it goes nowhere . So just try to either intervene or move it around and shift it around . And it goes nowhere . So . that I mean, , to this needed . But I touch everything to And I had to go to everybody . That was quite challenging . Not going do that in a kind of different approach . kind . funny Who needs smart contracts ? It s all a scam . And also the assumption : Oh , you re all massively rich . Devcon you was , I kind . It was completely over of coined the terms of for comment standard space to then go off and create the Lukso standards proposals And he made the early version of and do it there , even though that's just Ethereum standards too . Just so that I could do it . like, And it's bit of a different way how it's injected . Same provider . How your dApp connects to the node . Same RPC endpoints . Pretty much not too much added going either . EOAs have been the default since back then . And fun fact Jeffrey told me you guys should not expose the public to show . That video will be there. , I obviously just Ethereum standards too . Just so functions on I didn't see the need . Fun fact , later ,

**[58:57] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, this is the thing most people don't understand. shit this that . people talk at all . But I pulled being made up. now. That stuff has been made up before, but before. For example, But like, launches, launched, the feed that they're now cut off again, right? Like, where . let's , a were starting to work . That and had to do . the internet . So let's see , in a And , in it year will 0 , which was , show people in Berlin . that , and was necessary approach . evolve . So , funny I there was this mean, , you were at the EF , working on Mist through to 2017 ? No , August 2018 . 2018 . that . So , mean , what further work happened in Mist between that first . That was just absurd . But he release right . And now in all these years and at I built . Now I built exactly that kind of foundation that we discussed back in the day and . the because it sun the authorized operator function , it didn't work in Uniswap . So they wrapped it . And that's why wrapped Mist coin is the real Mist coin right now , a setting where ? I like mean figure out their own , They have what value over was And while posts that disappear after ? a so about work not betting on them. That's fucking scamming people, right? the only None of that stuff we in is new. And what is to me is the Mist space . So ? worked for three and a half years at . And I just realized , guys , if we are doing like this , that shit is going nowhere , three and a half years , Ethereum . And then in the later years , I really started working more on something else to But I was also on the tools standardization . And fun fact , we discussed , I watched it the . I mean , I overtook Web3 . js , in which it was the me stepping main JavaScript library at the time creating . different standards track in order When even do that . Marek when you just do that left this existing ecosystem with standards debates it's just so you . And you need , be backwards compatible . You to think in ways that you just move the current wagon along join Parity or Ethcore , I overtook Web3 . js . So I mainly maintained this library . I built the Web3 , the 2 . 0 version of it . That was the thing I did before I left . Right . we made every point the first six Devcons , but then the moment I was not at the Foundation anymore and doing another chain , then you re like : outcast . Even though the tech I m building now , and the first I ve been building over the years , is extremely relevant to Ethereum as It's the same provider. Now there's a bit of a different way how it's injected. Same provider. How your DEF connects to the, node.

**[60:08] SPEAKER_02:** Same RPC endpoints. Pretty much not too much added here either. you . know , standards . And was two main the . Oh , should we 2 metadata into . API . And of then. that the app know the history or So the that you re library , really important . you are the And of Ethereum . I kind up of true stepped in the last year , I stepped a little out kind the Mist team . I mean , I was just focused on the other things more , you I was still like , you know , you know the kind of the , Or in Mist the But now there was more maintenance . know thing is , we really tried to create more the things more to but I was still kind of the main developer in Mist . But now there was more maintenance . The thing is , we really tried to create more of the Mist should use a smart content account. browser Right . that stuck with . And he was right. It was quite complicated because we were always lagging behind Chromium and Electron.js . So Electron.js used Chromium . Chromium is what we idea. I mean, to tried to barely figure out how to make any changes you have so many people that will work try to either intervene or move it around and shift it around . And it goes nowhere . So I needed to do that in a kind of different approach . Kind of funny enough you know I kind of coined the ERC request for comment standard space to then go off and create the Lukso standards proposals and do it there even though that's just Ethereum standards too . Just so that And could do it right . And it's going this through a smart that was just absurd. But the team , you the first one that fit the spec , except for the operator stuff . So there's a . of . out we then used . I a year from now and Virgo . So I immediately tried to fix things and if there was a bug or something like this in Chromium , it needed to first be supported by . before we could support this , it was quite a cycle . We worked a lot on the interface . On the end , the Ethereum wallet , or people called it the wallet , was the main thing ever really used People never really fully used it as a Web3 browser . But we built all that's , I in there are people doing on-chain They history of what was Jeffrey's team . We were a little bit more open , at least how it that to me . kind really , to of today still the big split . You know , do you put information into a registry , like ENS ? Or do you put it into the user owned contract itself ? Or do you make a registry in AI The Or do you put the metadata in and . So I had to talk to people when something was not working . And it's crazy how much happened in the AMAs . It all of this learning and account around this, and months fact, it also took me stepping outside, out of the theme ecosystem, ? And creating a different standards track in order to even do that. Because when you just do that in this existing ecosystem, with existing standards debates, there . I built it's in there that an app could set notifications on the sidebar . And so there's , lot of features that we added . the just that were So because the moment . the because problem for the Mist browser , and in a way , the death of the Mist browser , was the slow browser , was the slow syncing and the Ethereum nodes . you , And because we then in the later years I really started working wanted on the developer tools . I mean I overtook Web3 to js which was the main JavaScript library at the time be When Marek left with Gavin to do it , funnily the . And we discussed this . And full , what's funny , when you looked at , I , said , they asked decentralized , what think you way , we didn't ? And just said , you I the . But the whole dApp , because want to want to make radical changes, Because when we launched the nodes , this stuff can't change anymore . Because now have once so many people that will just gotten the recognition they deserve . Felix , or example , is a great example . That dude built and overtook it goes nowhere. js So I to do it a day or two before that . I think we needed it for testing or showing something on how tokens of work . It may

**[61:44] SPEAKER_02:** kind, of funny , server . I else to . to . I hosted believe , was so had peeping out on ? would have , so . to , instead of talking to the local host node , to talk to a remote node . I mean , I could have added that feature . In no time . The reason , because we didn't do this , because it really just went against the whole idea of really doing it decentralized . The only problem is that then after , you There was so of Gavin to fix costs . It and have been so easy change , instead of the to the out there . node . standard space to then tokens talk and create the Luxor a proposals, remote node mean it . even though that's I Ethereum standards mean to , I could I could that feature in no time . The reason , because we didn't do this , because it focused And it's going to show. that video will be the . The internet. So I was still like the main developer in Mist months, in a year from now, more maintenance . The thing is we really tried to create more of the Mist browser . It was quite complicated because we were always lagging behind Chromium and Electron.js that was The necessary , like , a little bit of an uphill battle

**[62:16] SPEAKER_00:** first developer preview of Myst went live . a little So, . uphill I mean, . say . Then I two teams , I mean , I guess you bug or at like this in Chromium it needed to first be supported by Electron.js before the could support this . So it was quite a cycle . We worked a lot on the EF, Marek was working on MIST through , of , really propose doing No, August . interface 2008. . seven nice 2018. So, I mean, , after Vitalik . in he s like that . s true . He s like EIP repository . And the sun setting? syncing mean, what was that? further? syncing

**[62:44] SPEAKER_01:** so my

**[62:44] SPEAKER_02:** work was In the that tokens needed to be a primary focus . Mist really didn't happen until ERC-20 kicked off the browser , if you didn't have . And I the idea , I . a browser extension , And to a remote node , and I do a light version of MetaMask . And I , injected it into an existing browser . And that idea won . So even buy any Ether at all . So , took sometimes like half an , hour in and plus a . So way what happened , is , outcompeted MetaMask , the up , Mist Kumavis And browser came up . then And in , the came then with on with top of this , you know the , the idea difficulties of , keeping it secure I, on the end what , made us shut it I down . But then built we had a lot a more ideas . I browser extension really connected to a mean , look at the remote video . Like , we hadn't even started , we hadn't even really node , started I do working light started version of MetaMask on the what made us shut it I mean, But then we I a lot more idea . I mean never really fully used . Just because of moment , the biggest problem for the Mist browser and in a Which was death the Mist browser was Mist browser on Mastercoin before , there was colored coins , the fully . But at currencies the time. of . Bitcoin think Gavin and , Jeffrey started . And then I had to help with to know join because we had to ETH Core, I , Web3 .js. So I mainly maintained this library. I built the Web2, the 2 .0 version it That was the last . And I had to Right. Releasing the , even the , we hadn't even really started playing out the showed a lot right time . But it really showed a lot of people how things can be done , why to do it this way , how to build the apps , how of , you know , it set the stage . I mean , in that of that pieces someone hosted . And also the Ethereum Foundation probably wouldn't have paid for a node hosted on a server for everyone else to connect that . library. completely believe that , local , And I kind to deal with the C++ client the to work as a client in the Mist . I little out the Mist I . But at the time , it was just not , it was , the right time . But it really showed a lot of people how things I be done , why to do it this way , how to build the apps , how to , it set the stage , I mean comment was remember focused as the other not really building things But I was the idea of creating random tokens know, random stuff completely boring . Because for , what is the value of this ? Why would you create a token And honestly , if you look , and if you of the , most well in MIST. . course there was more maintenance. pinching on costs that's It would have been so easy to going of the to the is, we really to happen create more , why would I either . So those interface

**[63:47] SPEAKER_02:** browser. ? up . The whole ? stack of Ethereum we made up in I was like , first few months . And , you know , because I built the piece that put it , that we to there . a because version in . proper specification we Because your , and time here , you should have at least some reward . And what people don t understand : most people that worked at Ethereum didn t care about the money or an investment . Neither did I . That wasn t why we involve the community . Like , you want to ? a consensus around the token standard , and , everybody needs to listen and . going to have , Ethereum node running on every device . It'll be like , you'll is one running , the background on your We . They'll be in every router , media station , Also , there was , there was the idea of the light clients , needed you first know supported , and we before we knew support there were light clients coming . cycle. And we really bet on the fact interface. that the light client will solve that problem . The only problem is the light client never , came , or called it the MIST wallet, didn't have it open for a week took sometimes half an hour and plus . So what happened is MetaMask came up . Kumavis came up with the idea I build a browser extension connected new miners . You can just float it on Ethereum . It's like a simple thing . But it's like , here's the very first sort of thing . It's not very interesting . But you know , we've done something . What people don't really right version do , of never . problem is really And client never came , or it came , but it was not cross-client , and it didn't really work it So , we hoped a idea won . So MetaMask kind of like in a randomly edits , like But this file . And this is the we comment that Gavin made , funny enough all Editing , we all , like in node , the dApps , the I built lot RPC input , everything into one app . I in know , that Ether or whatever . I don t know if app kept it or not . I guess he did . And I even on Jeffrey give the . Jeffrey gave almost the same light client . This was a why of features we kept to doing browser it were never this way used. , because the idea was , once you have the light client , the thing is like this . so the you know , we'll just build on the full node , build on the full node for now , and then , you know , that light client will come in . the I think we came that far . I then we had a mean , I think there was versions of the . Like we hadn't even Mist , we hadn't even really started playing out the idea browser, the Mist browser fully . But at the time it was just not it was not the right time . Ethereum nodes.

**[64:44] SPEAKER_01:** .

**[64:45] SPEAKER_02:** And because we wanted to do it the full, that showed a lot of people how things can be done why to do it this way we 20 . synced very fast . But at the in . by I time , you know , to talk . And , to MetaMask . And , again , security a other reasons on the end , like , made , kind of , like , you know , give up . But I already moved on to Web3 . js terms of that local node , my focus , because can that a little more . I found that hosted. wasn't knauser . I the Ethereum Foundation , what's first , value , blah , blah , blah a blah , or amount or tool hosted on a server like proper , done , designed , cross-client functional thing . exactly what we did , connect to. comprehend Everybody

**[65:04] SPEAKER_00:** how believe that. think there was so of the Mist browser that had Geth built in with light client support that synced very fast . But using the time , by this time , people already really moved on

**[65:08] SPEAKER_02:** it would have been so easy . MetaMask . And , again , security and other reasons on the to made us kind of the up . But I already moved on to Web3 . js at the on Ethereum . thinking how to make a token . The whole DEX and DeFi stuff mainly came from the outside . People saw an opportunity to make money or I Lego mean, whatever , 70 million , 140 I downloads . God knows what that of course that's going to happen right ? Of course you're going to like everyone's going to have an . was running like . were not , I mean . who got . excited about this . Also , Devcon 1 , more speculation , and more speculation is not necessarily good , specifically in an and , over . And then , some point , it was only mainly , when I left , then at some point , Alex shut it down for the reasons also . because money was never the intention of anyone we I know , of us felt it be big , didn't . I mean , it . And , so we discussed there about 60 people in total , 300 comments . But pretty much after quite a while already , everybody kind of felt more or less that this had its purpose , you know The , And , the idea way , the idea of Bitcoin was clients and we knew there were light clients coming . And we really was on the fact that the light client will solve that problem . The only problem is that then . You know, six, seven, eight months, all the Mist browser, never came or it is have it was it cross-client and still didn't really fully work . So we hoped a lot on the light client . This was why we kept doing it a very JavaScript valid , talking to idea own endpoints , Right And I mean , and looking through old , in building now is fact , you know, , up, what know, I'm building now with the is a cross . It's like a Mist browser mobile , to is interesting , because what I'm building now And I do realized that Jeffrey's team and Gavin's team was a little thing is like this And I just to , like , was a . browser . is interesting , because what I'm building now is almost like a full circle . So I introduced a smart contract account , the same like Jeffrey said we should do it . That's the foundation of your access to Web3 . And then you have a web browser in an app made the all uncomfortable . The , and immediately jumped and it money , money , money . that And I just realized , guys , if we are doing like this , that allows you to interact with the apps easily while doing it in a human-focused way . So , not wallet-focused way of but profile-focused way , safe way , easy , in a way first test coin , the missed coin that I used then to test in the missed browser , I did the authorized operator functions . And because I didn't like that , like , the for humans . Which was also , by the clients nowhere on the full node for , and on top of you know if we don't work together . and . it would be too complicated , too much iterations . So I tried to make the team talk , these two it way is on the end what made us able to work with either . And I think then , had a more ideas. I mean, look at the video. Like, we hadn't even started, we hadn't even really started playing the idea of the MIST browser fully. Geth built in with light client support but synced very fast at But the time, by this a safe bet . Ethereum was It complete gamble . When I donated Ether , people say , you gave him 100 Ether . But it . And again was not other reasons in the end like made us kind of like give up . But the . It on . can have that raw speculation , but in some wallets for building stuff . I hope I could find some again . But was not to be meant for nerds and techies , maybe , whatever . Nobody cared . But from the outside , they all thought we all did it , It was meant , be . people interacting with this new technology , right ? That was the whole point . And this is going to come now with the of Profile app as kind of like a Mist browser Viem and be took over . And to iterations in So it this to its first mainly like then version when I . then at point . build The down for I reasons also mean one . probably the first , DEX . So they were , you got GavCoin and know, , you know I , part of Jeffrey's . We were a little bit more the , at least how it goal being not just

**[66:31] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, of was quite seminal in that, existing applications , but on the blockchain , but to enable these things that . first time . Devcon . was , in my , coin , I weren't didn't add the authorized operator . I didn't see a need . Fun fact , later , people picked up the missed coin , like , as a collectible meme token , collectible coin . And because it integrating all of course to going to , right? first dApps were probably built by Gavin and Jeffrey , but they used all the clunky half-baked Ethereum node running, like, on every device, I guess , GavCoin was written in LLL and JeffCoin was written in Mutant . But they did do , you know , yes , like built , first , one dApp browser , like have what's interesting , and that's really , for one , the most surprising thing , is , we are 10 plus years into Ethereum . And there's so many networks the EVM , apps . The most ones did not get to go . I could not afford to go me But what then your off . So the moment DeFi happened , I thought , like , that's just a every big gamble kind park .

**[66:58] SPEAKER_02:** of idea of the light . DeFi is working , stablecoins are being used , the financial Lego works , but

**[66:59] SPEAKER_00:** ,

**[66:59] SPEAKER_02:** You people who went through the hoops . The financial Lego works , yes , but only with the people that went through the hoops . Now you know, And seen important now is a cross . We like a Mist browser mobile which is interesting because what I'm building now is almost like a full circle . So I introduced a smart contract account the same like Jeffrey said we should do it . That's the foundation of your access to Web3 . And protocols you have . But I kind They're found back , LA ways really . Gavin really on the sync of , but to enable these things that weren't possible before , right ? Having this hub , integrating all of these different pieces of your life , that was real utility . Exactly . And what's interesting , and that's really , for me , the most surprising thing , is we are 10 plus years into Ethereum . And there's so many networks , EVM , apps . The important ones are very financial-focused , which is also something that really turned me off . So the only problem , the light client never, a token that has the function to interact with but it But this was just a test token . It was meant to . I just didn't really fully work. So, far , a hoped a , that , it's important protocols . They're . important . it just became such a . park and casino that it . really turning me off . But what's interesting is we go to conferences . You know , we go to any place you can go in the , This Web3 make this people working on now . So how did you come to leave the EF and what was , and no one is using Web3 apps . Like . was Like to . meant for nerds and You . have was some , obviously , people have wallets , and maybe they're purchasing a coin here and there . But , like , interacting with actual apps , like voting on something , joining a community , giving reputation , doing all the things you could do on chain , it doesn't happen . And honestly ,

**[67:23] SPEAKER_00:** like

**[67:23] SPEAKER_02:** , for me ,

**[67:23] SPEAKER_00:** is something Mist browser on mobile in its first version so, you I mean were starting to work more together and had to do a lot of , you know just build sort of replicate existing applications but on the . me in full node for now, and that you know, that light client in come in. there's .

**[67:33] SPEAKER_02:** And I think it with Alex the Ethereum wallet , which was the first ever dApp on Ethereum , like proper , done , designed , cross-client functional thing . That's exactly what we did Istanbul . But I it has a market cap and people trade it . And it is what it is . I was , of the misbrowser that had guests built in with light client support that synced very fast. cross-client , but the first really got the UI the moment I was not at the Foundation anymore and doing another blockchain , you're an outcast . Even though the tech I'm building now has been extremely relevant to the Ethereum ecosystem , the people who pick on to MetaMask. And, again, security and . reasons honestly , that the for me , is something I would never . thought . If would have thought me in like, or . or 2017 that in 10 years there's still no actual , using number one , if that are 10 plus years into Ethereum . And there's , many networks EVM apps . it's most ones are very financial-focused which is also something that really turned me then off . So the moment DeFi happened I thought like . kind . And number two , there's no way this is true . Like , what are the chances ? And here we are . It's funny , crazy . I remember in 2018 , I went to the Consensus conference , like the Consensus , not Consensus , conference in of, York , so New York Blockchain Week , and there was a You there that was sort of almost like a Bitcoin versus Ethereum thing . And you have up. . that I , which was launched , I , that happens , it's a total fail . And number two , there's no way this is true . What are the chances ? And here we are . It's crazy . I remember in 2018 , I went to at the at the New with my focus, because that the tool. will host all three things . I mean, million, 140 million downloads. God knows what it has nowadays. it's still used to download a lot, even though now vm, and others took over. stuff , and then at will come back and talk about this . This is too much tea . Sorry for the interruption . No worries . I ll cut it and own stack . A little JavaScript page , talking to their own endpoints , when I left, then at some point, Alex idea how Ethereum came to be it who contributed . They just came in during the 2017 ICOs or 2020 DeFi . For . the what that leave just one chain . So many contributors haven't gotten the did you do , and what have you been doing ? I was kind of in a good place . I worked on web3 . js . The developers loved me because Song relic tokens , relic coins . Yes . like , I doing sort mean, human it history . There are people doing . on But what's you know. we go to . You fucking dickhead with his any cowboy hat , go And, the world and by the , there got overtaken and supported by you was of the in London the where both Jeff and Gav were sort of had is Joe Web3 apps . Like . Like you have some obviously people have wallets and maybe they're purchasing a Lubin . And, Jimmy was saying , you know , like , dApps are , you know , useless , smart contracts are useless , like nobody's going to be , like , using these in five years . And , like , him and Joe having a bet , you know , for a pretty significant amount of , Bitcoin . I can't remember what now on something joining a it's in a misbrowser team And I interesting, because , I'm building now is almost like a full circle. And you have Jimmy Song with his cowboy hat , and you had Joe Lubin . And Jimmy was saying , dApps are useless , smart contracts are useless , nobody's going to So, using these in five years . And him and Joe having I bet for a pretty significant amount of Bitcoin . I can't remember , it ended up the same the end I don't know what . know , but then they were , like , talking about the terms . It , discussion of , is this , of . this , he didn't , like , propose to . off his penis . Yes . It's not , McAfee . But , it's the . DeFi is . Stablecoins are being used . I mean , the stable coins are being used . I mean , the being used . I mean , the , yes , but only with was the translator people to that , went . through I had the hoops around . The transaction is And . The code is still around . It's like a relic . And now , obviously , you have I would never have thought . If somebody would have told me in the goal 2016 or 2017 that in to with there's the no actual users using the apps I would have thought like number one if that in a total fail . And number two there's So, way to wallet -focused way, but profile -focused way, idea : let s do something with fashion , lifestyle on the blockchain . And I that, like, , often misunderstand is how much , was the 2014 the way, the idea of the misbrowser. they had was one of probably the first on-chain . So they without fame or attention for and . I mean , I spoke to him in Buenos Aires . And the funny thing is , he's such a humble guy to was to the Consensus conference like the Coindesk not ConsenSys conference in New York so New York Blockchain Week and there was a panel there that was sort of almost like a Bitcoin versus Ethereum thing . And you have Jimmy Song you know fucking dickhead with his cowboy hat and you had Joe Lubin . And Jimmy was saying you know like dApps are useless smart contracts are useless like nobody's going to be one . these brands as the Trojan horse to make this technology attractive to people , how many ideas were the present . earlier . that integrate and make it more easy . So the whole trading part , sure , that worked out . Like , you and , people buying , selling , there's a big , but the normal user using Web3 infrastructure in their daily lives , non-existent . Non-fucking-existent . And , for myself , I know why . And I spent the last seven years just thinking about that and how to solve that . This . Like , this is to I am working on now . So how I as . of like a misbrowser on it was in around the time of this first was written in Mutan did

**[69:35] SPEAKER_00:** I you know , the really don't like Early Days of Ethereum . I don't want the attention . And I was saying to him , you're like the longest-serving person at the EF after Vitalik . And he's like to I'm just a janitor . I we as a client in the blockchain, , as the Geth client . to enable these things that, like, weren't was before, much right? Having this, hub, integrating just . leave of EF and what was that journey like and then what have you been doing ? Tell me about all tell me about , all me about all and remember what thing ended up being , the end . And I don't of what you know but then they were like talking your the terms . It was this crypto Twitter ongoing discussion of work there . was And , he before like we do this , I need to go pee . So you need to look at the timestamp

**[69:58] SPEAKER_02:** and then . I will That's back and for me, . This is the much tea . Sorry for . interruption universal profiles is, No worries tea . No into . So , I'll cut it and I'll just ask again . So , why don't could you tell apps. the most ones are very financial -focused, which is also something that really turned me then off. So the moment DeFi I thought like, remember Marjorie a big bit , advice here and I . At the mean, time , worked , and a half , how could tokens work in there ? or whatever . But it's needed to test , you know you do and what have you been doing ? So , well , I mean , I was really of in a way in a good place . I worked on Web3 . js . The developers , me because but built their foundational piece . The Mist browser was kind of a bit fading out , but it how t think I m gaining a lot more from now on . In hindsight , I m right . When I look at others still there , it s a bit about how you came to leave the , EF I And want to build an app , why would I need some what And . like that's , of was motivation was really ? was kind the . 1 demo for your presentation . No , is mean , did it for , You mean , yes , DEFCON did know, , what did you do and what have you been doing ? So , well , I mean , I was kind of in a way , in a good place . You know , I worked on Web3 . js . The developers loved me because I built their foundational piece . The stuff Mist And browser was , you about with the whole trading part sure that worked out . Like people buying and I , and there's a big but the normal user using Web3 of Like, daily lives you have got that interop . And I guess maybe some of the Whisper stuff was maybe kind of cross-client , but you have And got the UI a know why . and there. But, like, interacting , of like a bit fading out , but , it was cool too . I was kind of in a good , So , what happened is the like , you know , my ex-wife at the time , she had this idea of , you know , hey , let's do something with fashion , lifestyle on the sounds super boring . Like I know that there's so many people who already try to do something like this that . so many people who already , like , try to do something like a . But then I thought a about and things done , token was not yet in there , really , because the token thing was still kind of very out there . Like , doing , no all really had the I mean , we you , before we do this I need to go pee . So you need to look at the C++ , s tough , that s her character , but it So integrated or working . and initial idea even that, used yet , me, is I : stay at Ethereum comfortable , thought. If somebody would have told me in 2015 or 2016 or 2017 that in 10 years there's still no actual users using the apps, more already , have thought, like, to And one, if that happens, it's a total fail.

**[71:21] SPEAKER_02:** big , and want to make tokens . And a bit about it and , about with the , but we can use lifestyle and , the when you get big technology . could be the Trojan horse of how we and . technology attractive and interesting this people , the trading is So I thought , is technology the interruption . No worries . So I'll . it and I'll just ask again . So why don't could you Like, me That bit about how you came to leave the EF and what like could motivation was ? And what be the horse of how we make this technology attractive and what have you been doing of the trading .

**[71:32] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[71:32] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[71:33] SPEAKER_00:** I remember , in he kept it or not . I kind , I guess he did . conference,

**[71:40] SPEAKER_02:** was

**[71:41] SPEAKER_00:** like the Consensus, not Consensus, conference of New York, so New York Blockchain Week, and there was a panel there that was sort of almost it also sounded like a lunatic , crazy idea and completely out of my league . So initially , I thought , I can support Marjorie a little bit . She does the project . I can help a little bit of advice . And she does it . At the same time , I worked for three and a half years at Ethereum is kind of genius . But and also sounded like a lunatic , crazy idea and you out of my league . as us . I had barely any , but Jeffrey has a fuckload . I was like , dude , Jeffrey , you So , initially , I thought , I can support Marjorie a little bit . You know , she does the project . I can help . A little bit of and . And kind she . like , does it . At the same time , I and for three and was half years at Ethereum you know, mean kind of like a bit fading out but it was cool too . I was kind of in a good place . So what happened is like you know, my ex-wife at the time it's useless, like nobody's to be, like, , a primary focus . It was just like , hey , do it , let's do it . The wallet was not really meant to immediately be super supportive of that , except that I And, the test card for that . And we played around , and Joe . And it's a bet, called ERC-725 . it's interesting . know, for a pretty significant amount of, Bitcoin. I can't , I think ended . urgency . That just really the happen after this , then , I 20 , then kicked off the , to do . felt , And I did everything I can do here . I can now don't here for another 10 what, . But I don't know you there's know, many but who already like try to do something , they . But then like, thought a bit about it and thought like now , people was this was can somehow point like , an on is . how much , number you , And in and happen . There was no certainty whatsoever

**[72:34] SPEAKER_02:** to cut off I was at a BCG workshop . They

**[72:35] SPEAKER_00:** ,

**[72:35] SPEAKER_02:** to make identity on the blockchain . I was the only one coming up with something concrete .

**[72:37] SPEAKER_00:** it's

**[72:37] SPEAKER_02:** that

**[72:38] SPEAKER_00:** not, McAfee. building things world changed for them in terms of what they're working on . It's others the same that's for sure. , I mean , know, DeFi is working. You know, . And the world changed for them , you know , in terms of what they're working on . It's the same thing . And then at some point , you know , when we started , you know , pitching out the project or , like , pitching , deteriorating the project and mapping out . And someone just , Marjorie , kind of really forced me .

**[72:53] SPEAKER_01:** I

**[72:53] SPEAKER_00:** you're all in or you're out . And then , I made this kind of , and she was a tough mean, .

**[72:54] SPEAKER_01:** I

**[72:54] SPEAKER_00:** The account system .

**[72:54] SPEAKER_01:** I called it proxy account , like we called it in 2015 on

**[72:54] SPEAKER_00:** the it's just kind of , That's , her character . But mean , the

**[72:59] SPEAKER_02:** , that no one that I knew it's going to be a thing that me hoops. say ,

**[73:01] SPEAKER_00:** now

**[73:01] SPEAKER_02:** , do I want to stay here of the , kind of I thought this is kind of genius . But it also sounded like a lunatic crazy idea and completely out of my league . So initially I thought I can support Marjorie a little you know, You know she does the project . I can help a little bit of advice . And some point , you know , when we started , you know , pitching out the project or , like , pitching , deteriorating the project and a out . And someone just , Marjorie , kind of really forced me . but you're all in or you're out . And then , I made this kind of , and she was a the normal user using Web3 infrastructure all , daily lives, non -existent. . -fucking -existent. And. I, for , it's I know We to propose this as a standard . Something in me told me : put it out there . I had no idea why . There was Bitcoin rising , and . Or do I on top , the Bitcoin , and they call it colored coins . So , there was clearly a , need for it . But I want to stay here at Ethereum , kind of comfortable , but now for indefinite whatever ? Or do I just go all in ? Crazy risk ? You know , something new , something different . And I knew my Ethereum colleagues would think , what the . just , years girlfriend just I don't think I'm that he's just more doing . from centralized point fashion shit And , blah , blah , blah Like, While at the same , I knew

**[73:27] SPEAKER_01:** this

**[73:27] SPEAKER_02:** is . functional for real adoption . And my idea , obviously , was a little different than Marjorie's idea . While she wanted to do something with fashion , I on now. profiles across a smart content account system of wanted stack adoption

**[73:33] SPEAKER_00:** you come

**[73:33] SPEAKER_02:** to

**[73:33] SPEAKER_00:** leave the EF standard . And a lot of projects came , and they created the ERC-725 And then Protocol and then uPort doing? super pissed some centralized tell me about, all shit work there? blah , blah

**[73:45] SPEAKER_02:** before we do this, I need to go pee.

**[73:47] SPEAKER_00:** .

**[73:47] SPEAKER_02:** you

**[73:47] SPEAKER_01:** need

**[73:47] SPEAKER_02:** to at the others that's still there I mean it's not that the world changed for them in cents a piece . I

**[73:50] SPEAKER_01:** guess

**[73:50] SPEAKER_02:** . We all this. 10 or 20 Ether on wallets laying , for . stuff . Nobody be cared honest . But much tea.

**[75:07] SPEAKER_02:** Sorry the protocol at the time , thought : what the fuck ? Why is now this Ethereum standard ? We ve been working on Ethereum identity for , they thought we all just did it to get rich . The perception on the outside sometimes really distorted . people and built

**[75:11] SPEAKER_00:** it And now , 10 plus years later , we now project then So, why don't. – use you tell me a bit and everybody pays attention ? Then they wrote a big blog post : how her is leave the EF and what, is , motivation was? and, what you, know , fashion connection friends and the people that we had initially , you know mapping , And you just Marjorie with of really forced the . Either project all in , you're out . who then I had this kind the

**[75:32] SPEAKER_02:** and she

**[75:32] SPEAKER_00:** connections a tough

**[75:32] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[75:33] SPEAKER_00:** .

**[75:33] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[75:33] SPEAKER_00:** As a

**[75:34] SPEAKER_02:** mean, , kind of tool to get the users and people into using this technology . And at the same time , I also came up with a standard called ERC-725 before LUKSO . It's 725 , which is one standard after 721 . Even though there's three other issue numbers after , but there were nothing in called middle . It was a you . know, after . And so that was stay here at . kind , one standard after 721 , experiments and . things , didn ? after the . just go all in crazy risk ? Something new something different . And I the my Ethereum colleagues would think what the people , were I . Like , oh , you're was an early middle ; there needs to be a lot more , But everybody the it like it s the even . And also . assumption that know, all I mean, . It's so of like Felix's thing there was one , which I think was a out, it . was a proper standard really . After . I so that was a coincidence how I was up with 725 . I was in a where both . So, , shit blah exactly what happened did , know, my at the at the time, BCG this is a path for real adoption . And my idea obviously was a little different than Marjorie's idea . While she workshop . idea They wanted . Of digital cash streams to make something with fashion, identity on the blockchain. . I was the only one really coming up with something concrete . And after I felt I made this smart contract account system . I call it proxy account . Same like we called it 2015 at the panel , funny enough . And then I had this urge after this whole workshop series that the panel , funny enough as a standard . I , And : was I . And the , you , like , it out there . And was impoverishing myself being involved . Even when I got hired at the Foundation , I was getting paid 60k a year , which was like half of what my prior salary had been . And had this urge after this whole workshop series that I need to propose this as a standard . I just really , like there was something in me telling me , you need to put it out there . And I had no idea why . And I didn't want to because I was fine , you know , with what I was doing . I didn't really need attention on anything . But in the moment I put it out there , suddenly the whole Ethereum space to or like a lot of these with what I was doing . I didn't really this. attention on anything . But in the moment I put it out there , suddenly the whole Ethereum space , or a lot of these developers were , my God , this get , Ethereum identity But then And we started LUKSO , a few months after , I lot : if I want to make a and like, but we can use lifestyle and fashion, specifically when you get big players and, like, chain normal users through these brands and whatever. And we can get mainstream people, normal people, into using this technology. that And at the Trojan time I also came up with a standard called ERC-725 before Lukso . It's 725 which is one standard before 721 . No one standard after 721 even though there's three outside issue numbers of but there the nothing in the . piece . was that s and there , if a company or non-technical people cannot use an on-chain account properly UX needs to be easy and if the thing is not ideally unlosable , there s no way you can put these people on-chain So, It s not going to work . They re not going to run around with wallets with private keys they need to remember . So , this got is and JeffCoin , you of , is prior of any standards , I guess . And GavCoin was the Origin Protocol and . And written in Mutant it But was super Reddit , a ? Bitcoin , like was 60k . But And like , here's the very first ConsenSys of the , I thought, . identity support Marjorie a little bit. I negotiated it up to 90k before tax . People think if you got the back then , you must be insanely rich . Dude , when it hit 10 , we all thought we made it to the universe . We protocol little bit of advice. , she, like, , what people don't really realize , at much more the time , thought like , what the , fuck ? Why does now this Ethereum standard ? And we are working on this Ethereum identity for the last year . And now Fabian comes and just makes a standard and everybody pays attention and what is going on here . And then they wrote a big blog post , how Lukso is this massive monster and there is this modular system . And I didn't want neither the really coming attention with something on . And that , nor did I even care . videos , there was one , which I think was a talk in London , where both Jeff and Gav , were sort of talking the foundation of I needed to do. I felt, I did everything contract account system . I call it proxy account . Same like we call it 2015 at the panel funny enough . And then and I had this urge after this whole workshop series that had I no need idea why to . And propose I this didn't want as to because a I standard was fine . with I what I just was doing really . But I didn't there really need was attention something on I in . me But telling me you in the moment I need to put it out there . And put I it out there suddenly the a Ethereum lot or like more, lot more you know, But everybody kind of , of these people treated it like it's the final thing . It's like , Ethereum identity is now . And it's like , man , guys . And I thought , you know now, God this point is if like it . been . all and in hindsight, . the first kind , real challenger when the status quo then And it split the community I mean, Bitcoin maximalist , that the , was one of probably the first on-chain DEX . So they you , know, , terms of what becomes working on. you the final thing . lead like , Ethereum identity is now and . then guys just build it out . Fine with me , I'm out , But then all excited , then someone becomes the lead when we started, just build it out . Fine with me , I'm out . But then when we started , which was a few out after the I realized , oh , wow , like, I want to make a , that's for normies mining , picking that the and mapping s almost , years to put people . and . only on LUKSO , to but it s sure , to would be a lot , money . But that means you aren't spending any money during all those years and you a standard of everybody pays attention and what is going on here . And then they wrote a big blog post how uPort is this massive monster and there is this modular system . And I didn't want neither the attention on that nor did I even care . I knew this was an early draft of the standard . There needs to be a lot more work . But everybody kind of is . most important piece . If that's not there , if a company or honestly . non-technical people cannot use an on-chain account properly , like UX And right , needs to be then, . And I that thing is not ideally unlosable , there's no way you can put these people on chain . This is not going to work . They're not going to run around wallets with private keys that I made this kind was and she was a tough person. I mean, I just kind of, . her character. But, in if no wow way, it kind of forced me to say, I want to make a chain here at for normies , that's for , creators , and anything outside of finance , identity for the most important piece . If that's not , if a company or people or non-technical people cannot use an on-chain account properly , like UX , right , needs to be easy . And if that thing is not , like , ideally unlosable , like , there's no way you can put these people on chain . This is not going to work . They're not going to run around wallets with private keys that I need to remember . Like , there's no fact you know, , you had that sort of cryptocurrency 2 . 0 phase at the start and I you knew , talking about Mastercoin my things , you know ? I possible , but I didn t expect it to happen so quickly . This is a frenzy that started two weeks ago . And it s exactly the account we would the fuck, They never girlfriend , I mean , DEFCON won . There was just more speculation , right ? And more speculation is not necessarily good , specifically in an environment in the early days where the regulatory , insecurity and uncertainty was just so high . So , the last thing we all wanted is now back centralized fashion shit, . blah. . was made up before . All at the out . The I LUKSO knew is its own episode seven years , eight years , a I now had to build out a standard full on . And that was really annoying because I didn't want to do this at all . Because I knew there was quite a lot of stuff was missing fully . or And it was just , and in hindsight was honestly , it was a complete psychotic idea. . Because it took me , four years to build out the foundational standards and anything outside , finance identity is the like important piece , that's not there full a company or on or non-technical people . use an Like , and then obviously now you it's because almost was know, eight into years to really put it's the people usable by people state where it's now usable by people . Currently only you Lukso , but it's And , know, helping with the project, who had the connections. to As a kind for , like , an offer , like , CPU mining , picking that up . you , did that , ago . and that stuff we in is new . And , very soon . And , these , same people . Fun it's transferred into fact , that's also a little This , I knew it's currently possible , but it's , I didn't is it to happen so quickly . So this is now a frenzy , just started , And , two weeks ago . And it's just , it's exactly the account we Like there's would way . So have needed was with had to build out a standard ERC 7 to 5 before the manifestation It's 7 to 5, Mist is one standard before , but how it works together in a Lego-like way : isolated , but composable . So I had the opportunity to do it right browser When this now comes cross-chain , specifically Universal Profiles , it s going to back , there's three other issue numbers after, but in were the day . And , and it took a while to build this out . So was annoying because I didn't want to do this at all . Because I knew there was quite a lot of stuff missing . And not 7 to 5. the was whole LUKSO story , it's an own whole episode of so , happened , the eight happened a lot in there . adoption happened . There s , way to convince people to migrate , token . on , s exactly where a new . makes sense . On account system . I . can do it all the a I in there . But long story short was I the , in a way , what I now is I built really account system . I evolved the in is just like a you know , minor quiet , minor that , space I made the LUKSO standards proposals . So I could really do it properly the I thought , how way can evolve it properly I make sure that thought and tokens work together . So it's not only how about Like standard isolated we the other . Like can evolve it properly , make sure that accounts and tokens work together the So it's not only think about one standard isolated and the other . things you know , that's one of and least then, parts And It's I , you know , you can have that I need to propose this as , a standard. really just really, Lego-like way while being isolated , but works , number you are discover more possibilities , cooler protocols , now usable by people . Currently only on Lukso but it's going to come to all other chains had Ethereum very soon . And no it's being used by AI . Fun fact . In fact that's also a little bit I idea it's currently possible but it's I , alone was . So I . So . to a new chain , sense also for gas subsidization , for smart contract I because they need to , do it right . And that's , I did , last you , and the first . in the DEFCON 0 being , when this . comes cross-chain , specifically universal profiles , it's going to show for the broader ecosystem I well , for sure . So token standards is something where once the train ran , you know , once people go with ERC-20 , whole episode of so much happened like seven years happened . Eight years which happened a lot in there . But long story short I mean in a way what like , is really built now comes cross-chain , specifically universal profiles , attention going to show for the broader ecosystem as well , for sure . So token standards is something where , the train ran , once people go with ERC-20 , they're kind of the adoption happened . There's no way you convince people to But , to migrate that token . It in happen the But day . It out all Reddit , right ? Bitcoin , like , all like today's crypto Twitter . Back in the right stepping space, a like a haven't even built half of were, my This is you can t really do on an existing network . And the rest of the EVM ecosystem just chose ERC-20 , a 2015 standard , and creating a of projects then later got overtaken and ESF to 5 Alliance, the origin protocol. , and, then Uport got super pissed because when was a consensus identity protocol at the time, thought like, what the, fuck? Why does . a new network . can . it all the new ways . Now you can discover that there's more possibilities , cooler protocols , more automation , different things you couldn't do on ERC-20 at all . So hence why a new chain makes total sense also for gas subsidization , for smart contract accounts , which obviously they need to be subsidized if you don't want to pay right away . And all of this stuff , something you can't And to go . I . could not afford to go . But . what are your memories at the time ? I mean We you must have seen so many things and right . So you were at the EF , for example , now I'm working on still came very far . It did a lot . But . So Universal Profiles for play a role . I think the will be the biggest enabler last really . And so you know when this now comes aware of makes a standard sense . Like , on a new network , you can do it all the new ways . Now you can discover that there's more possibilities , cooler protocols , more automation , different things you couldn't do on ERC-20 at all . So hence why a new chain makes total sense also for gas subsidization , for smart contract accounts , which obviously they need to be subsidized if you don't want to pay right away . And all of this stuff , something you can't really do on , an existing network . And on here. new network , you can do it all the new ways . Now you can discover that there's more possibilities , cooler protocols , more automation , different things you couldn't do on ERC-20 at all . So hence why a new chain makes total sense also for gas subsidization , for smart contract accounts , which obviously they blog post, Miles is this massive monster and there is this modular system. so first And I didn't what people the , like , often misunderstand is it nor did I even care. bigger than I knew been in every DEFCON so far of the, involvement in EVM chose ERC-20 , you to be a lot more work. want to kind right of, . And all of this stuff , video . the there and Like , don't see wallets . You see profiles . You , people it made it with do no prior up at the time with whatever we knew . which was . So it still the very far . I'm not going to lie . It did a lot . But , so , the whole LUKSO story is It did a lot its But , so it's whole own thing LUKSO story is its whole own thing . worked But three and a half years at universal profiles I are I going interested and to maybe play , which a firstly role I . a gold And I and I you know, will people go with ERC-20 they're kind of like the adoption happened . There's no way you convince people to use like to migrate that token . It doesn't happen . But that's they where a new network makes a lot of sense . Like on a new network you can do it all the new will . be you can discover the biggest enabler for Web3 . And I believe , it will be was at every DEFCON . I was always speaking at the first few DEFCONs , but then when tools the we . started Luxo, was a few months after, and I another blockchain realized, , wow, if I want to make a chain, that's for normies, that's for culture, creators, , made , They never . and Ethereum stack just because they felt that , what do you care ? Bitcoin's all you need . And I . I . there's a will lot bigger than ERC-20 of It's going to blow people's minds when they understand and see . I know there's a lot of before I left . We really tried to is more for the what it is . So , even though the It was quite complicated because we were So not there, why a widely tech people , including probably you and others , who have been watching me talking about this stuff for years now . Obviously , right to be ? if you don't want to And right Putting . And not that Alex it something you can't really do aside an existing network . And the as of the EVM system just chose , you know a 2015 standard with prior real evolution of and , these people on chain. this is just doing this thing and whatever , you know , something's happening there or not . It's like it's a bucket in the little isolated Lukso world . Who cares ? It's going bucket in . Mark developers who have been thinking about smart the accounts and account . made it up at the time with pick them , to talks and so on in , later years , right , they are fresh . Some of them I even know the history . So , to why , the work that blow Mark my words . You will see . It's Like, to blow people's minds a lot , especially the developers who have been , like , thinking , you it so smart contract . accounts and to already whole account abstraction for free a open source , usable while anyone on . thinking about smart contract

**[81:51] SPEAKER_01:** and

**[81:52] SPEAKER_02:** and

**[81:52] SPEAKER_01:** 2010

**[81:52] SPEAKER_02:** really

**[81:52] SPEAKER_01:** these ideas

**[81:53] SPEAKER_02:** because I , want to do this at all. for a while there are good ideas , but it's just very , still very simple . If you have a lot of people that people to , you know , have opinions and profiles are going to play a role it And was want they will be the biggest enabler for Web3 . And I believe it to be backwards compatible and used you want to be minimalistic in things , then you it get really far a Like , it's , I mean , browser . But because added , you can do payments . well , there you go . Well , that's not very interesting versus here's to the on all these you . Right you funny is we are in the , time of AI . OpenClaw the what open-source harness for AI to run s . I know you are playing around with one . I have my own , Emmett like, as well . If and want an AI interacting on-chain , you better need a smart contract account . Because if you just , it a private key , like , the , story , the participants it the ends and make up visible in transparent to the . same I have direction to . many people It they just barely any takes of way , like And . And this , that is DAX and whatever . And now have the foundation , and it's already even ready , discussions , And problems , same people , same size the groups . this you're suddenly back in some kind of time capsule of is all free , open source , that now usable by the Ethereum Foundation people. wouldn't have anyone for a on any network . And it will show once we open up our control apps to work on all these chains , then it becomes clear . But right now , what's funny , because we are in the time of AI , OpenDevin , like , sorry , Devin to OpenDevin , the AI tool that was just an open source harness for AI to all other chains, including right 2017 soon. and now , what's funny , because we are in the time of AI , OpenClaw , sorry , Clawdia , OpenClaw , the AI tool that a little bit. – who have been like thinking about smart but it's. – I didn't expect it to happen so quickly. AI tool that is now a frenzy that's just started, you know, what . It's , like , completely unknown . people just , like , you know , came have an AI interacting on chain , you better need a Smart contract account . Because if you just give it a private key , like a walkie from Gitcoin , just did the other day , right and You gave it a private key . There was all this money on it's . And just, for a while . And there are good ideas but it's , just figured very simple . If you have a lot of people that want to have opinions out you want to be backwards compatible and you want to be minimalistic in things then you don't get really far . Like it's how to trigger the , the return would private key have stole the money . I didn t spot that . That s interesting . You should check it out . With the missed browser back stole the day. remote , of a local host And, . We didn't it ready . And to do AMAs , this out. So the whole Luxor story, it's an own whole run of so much happened, like, seven . years, which happened a lot in there. But long story I mean , I know you are playing around with one . I have my own Emmett as well . So , if you want to have an AI interacting on chain , you better need a is contract account . Because if you just give it a private key , like a wookie from Gitcoin just did the other day , right ? You gave it a private key . There was all this money on it . And then somebody figured the how to trigger the AI to return . key and show once , the up our , apps . work , all these chains then it becomes clear . But right now . of . I , and there's so many contributors a have not gotten the recognition that they deserve . I mean , universal , for example , in profile , it's run . I mean I know you are playing around with one . I have my own Emmett as well . So if you want to have an AI interacting on chain you better need a very different : Because you have your smart contract account . You can delegate access to a single controller key or many controller keys . And you give the , you just tell your AI , hey , create yourself a controller key . Give me the public key . I authorize you to control the profile . But I will limit you to certain things . So , you could remote to certain things . You could it , version of MetaMask . I'll inject it is developed by 100 people , call certain functions , only update profile data , make that and cannot change controller keys together. decentralized only not only think about one standard isolated and the other. Like, think how it works together in a really Lego -like talk while you isolated, but works really well together, too. So I had this to as a student . here . My parents are not certain smart contracts . But it's just like , it was just so powerful that's what I did over certain . That , the , and it's the still , change controller keys . the Ethereum network and how , nodes talk to each other . And he has done that without fame . attention for . And private . along the way or whatever the fuck he will do . But his identity the his account , and all the stuff on it , you know , long as the key was not leaked and could move , everything , doesn't go you . And so . That's interesting . You now spun out bots . And now it's very easy . On your OpenDevin , you have a know, , this to only talk to certain smart contracts , call certain functions , only update profile data , make sure that he cannot change controller keys or add new ones . So you can really constrict him down . And now he can go a wild . Maybe even loses different . Because you have your smart contract account . You can for access to private key the way or whatever the fuck he will do . But his identity , his account , and all the stuff on it , as , sure. So a is , something . Felix Lang ? Felix Lang once the train was not leaked and you know, once people go with ESC20, was a thought of like, you know, the will get happened. us shut way you convince people , I mean , in terms of that I doesn't , full decentralization , I remember at the new network makes of lot of sense. Like, exactly . I mean , I a spoke , him in I Aires . And the . And is , he , like . Now , On very easy : on . give the you just tell your AI hey create yourself a controller key . Give me the public key . I authorize you to control the profile . But I will limit you to certain things . So you could limit him to only talk to certain smart contracts call certain functions only update profile data make sure that he cannot change controller keys or add new you can , you the universal profile skill . You , go , website , create a profile , and authorize it . And then he already has free gas on LUKSO because we subsidized this . And he can go do he can go do stuff on LUKSO right now all so . the And so , now the AI is on Twitter now this out . And now you can universal profiles because they can also quickly research , you discover on the fact that the light client would solve that problem . The only problem is the light client never came protocols, collectively automation, , things you couldn't do on ESC20 at all. I , why a new chain makes total sense also for gas subsidization, for smart contact accounts, which obviously they need to be subsidized , You don't want to pay right away.

**[84:36] SPEAKER_02:** and this of this stuff, , like , it has been around for really do on, an existing network. , And . but wasn't cross-client . we subsidized this . And whatever the fuck he will do . But , identity his . and , the they need . It's the AI is making the choice now . It is a funny , a fun thing to watch . And that's very recent . It just happened in the rest tech out there for that purpose . They say they need . It's the AI is making the choice now . It is just funny , a fun thing out bots . And now it's very easy . On your OpenClaw you can just install the universal profile skill . You just you know, , create a profile and you know , because Bitcoin itself was just sort of a , with be honest No , no . of, And . 0 had gone I mean, , I found myself thinking I don't want the attention , you know , like especially Like , so I over saying to him , the know , like , you're time you're , like , the longest serving person at the . quickly last what smart was few , it they weeks . They , people , to not going to lie. It that a lot. enough . That's maybe . Because they realize it's the , tech out there for that purpose they say they need end It's the AI is making the choice now . It is a funny , a fun thing users that Universal are going to play a And I these technologies are going to happened in the last two . we subsidized , And he can go do stuff for Lukso right now all by himself . And so now the AI is on Twitter figuring this out . And now they're shilling universal profiles because they can also quickly research what smart systems exist there out there how they work and what compared . And they all collectively decide to use universal profiles . Funny enough . That's fantastic . Because they realize it's the best tech out there for I'm just like a janitor , internet money , like , come just turn up and I s very recent last two weeks . I ve found myself thinking It the over the last few weeks , that maybe the end going to are going to have the most benefit , these technologies are going to be , At know partially a some of user experience stuff , like it never really got there or people including probably you and others, who have been not me talking about this stuff for years now. using , BitTorrent , it , as, this is just well , thing and , you know, , you were or not. forth to using dApps . And , they never do , but they use agents that do , you know . And this becomes the piping that allow the kind of experience on top that we've always wanted . I would say it's both . Yes , AI needs to have an on-chain account . And universal profile for works that . really And well that one works on any network . that problem one is works on , any I , got network the . But it , became you really apparent to it's , even though it's the AI is making the choice now . It is a funny a fun thing to watch . And that's very recent . It just happened in the last two weeks . No that's great . I mean I found myself thinking especially over the last few weeks that maybe the end users that are going to . And universal profile works really , for that . And that one works on any you . But , you know what ? I it's the main problem is , I going the , it became really to me , even though it's be and a think there's a Back self the , but , it was all Reddit , right ? Bitcoin , like, , dApps or so . Like , on the end , the Amsterdam office smart really more I that And this the account piping that allows the experience on top that we ve always wanted . I would say it so many networks . and there and other . ideas, but it's just very, still Ethereum very simple. if you think about it . But it became really want , to, needs an on-chain account , and Universal Profile works really well for that people not using not using dApps . And maybe they never do but they use agents that me what , know, main so , there's this cool dApp , you . And reason on any there you so . networks . Even if it s just Ethereum , if And even if recommend just Ethereum , if you friend , hey , friend , hey , you this cool dApp , you a or claim this token . Or let me you can ? or claim this token . Or let me just send you some , I don't send you some , I don't know , Like, . You should all over the I . So , something . mean, . the only thing not just to that existing applications on you're missing in the cool to invest in something that you feel equation going up ? Well , like how you , there ? and . And this . This one , is by now kind of that we've always wanted . I this would say it's both . Yes is wallet , have an on-chain account . And stop . But MetaMask is , just because I knew this is such a revolutionary technology . And , on I just , any I couldn't network. afford any . But you know what ? I think the main problem is I got the it of once we open up our control . to work on all these chains, then it becomes clear. but right now, wallet . They have an because we are . time , you know , creating a wallet takes seconds . In-app browser allows you to go there and connect without wallet connect , which is annoying , right ? But there's still something missing . And then see the gas , of and , Brazil , in Rio . Later , we hired multiple people . We hired another person from . it then you've like, things . Which is something that turned me off the main problem when no one is using apps on that conference or wherever . was the reason is just so many networks . And even if it's just or vote or claim this token , or I mean, , as a student here . My parents are not rich or anything . one. I have my own Emmet as . . So, if you want to some research , you use Rainbow wallet , Family wallet , they stop . But an is horrible . But use Rainbow wallet . They have an in the equation ? Like how . So creating a wallet takes seconds . In-app you allows you better go there and connect without WalletConnect , In-app browser allows you to go there and connect without WalletConnect You which you ? conference is , the , and , is , using Web3 apps . They , and . coins , that with : apps like voting the joining a community , giving reputation it doesn't ? like how you get there and how . This one is . now kind of solved . So if , and the thing is , exactly . So , and , thing is , if , exactly . So , and the thing is , if right ? you . But once , right , go to exchange or do on-ramp , buy the thing , move it then see the exactly gas of , the network like . you're . Just that saying onboarding , like that bootstrapping if step of how you , walk through the other once like that with gas is , that you're needing some you of that native token on all of the chains that you private key. at least still be no actual And then somebody figured to how to trigger the AI and even if my friends circles , you know , and friends , developers , some never made the move . the never money, into Ethereum stack investment . Neither did I . I mean , that was not the reason

**[87:27] SPEAKER_01:** I didn't spot that. That's interesting.

**[87:29] SPEAKER_02:** joined should check

**[87:30] SPEAKER_01:** it out.

**[87:30] SPEAKER_02:** So, and exchange it is truly it's very different. Because you have your SmartConner account. you can delegate so easily that to like , oh , fuck , I'm stuck . I've got the tokens . I haven't got the gas . Exactly controller So , and key or many , is , if , have , this process once , right , go to exchange or do on-ramp , buy the thing , move it to your wallet . And if you have a smart contract account , move it to the controller key , and most of the other wallets don't even expose the controller properly ? the whole . so confusing . then Bitcoin . have to do that for every other network . A person that has no understanding of this technology has no a Bitcoin versus Ethereum thing . You ability in a fucking million years to figure this out . If you want to , they don't care about it . It's like , here , do a no understanding the public massive in authorize you to years to load connect without wallet connect which is annoying right ? But there's still something missing . And then see the gas of the network . Just that onboarding like that bootstrapping step of how you of in . I mean the other thing like that with gas is that you're needing some amounts of that native token on all of the chains that you a massive things. of things you could limit him to only talk to certain smart contracts, , certain functions, only update and data, make sure that he cannot then controller keys or add new ones. you can really start was doing . No , and thing Lubin that Jimmy was saying dApps you useless maybe even about . Exactly . along , the way or And you can get so easily that you're like oh fuck I'm stuck he I've got the tokens . I . got the , nobody's going to be using these in five years . And him and Joe had a bet for a significant amount of Bitcoin over it . Luckily , he didn't propose to cut off his penis . It's disappointing . DeFi is working , stablecoins are being used , but I . per like . Give it a whole weekend . Then you still don t know what to and . They don the know what so means . The it, the I can t move this , because I don t have MATIC on walk through this would once right to exchange or , on-ramp You like thing move know, , number one . it takes a long the key to do was that . It in would Berlin , at Christoph least an to hour Berlin or so, . So , per multiple networks a give it a few people now spun out bots. controller key and whole very easy. On your open you can just little more . I found the little knauser . I forced him to his detail , I mean , I think the weekend like wallets don't even you the controller about . Exactly . So , it would , number one , it , a long time to do that . It would , at least an hour or so , per multiple networks , give it a whole you know, , confusing and then you wouldn't even need to know what to do . And that's what people don't understand . They don't even know what gas means . The notion that , oh , I can't move this token because I don't have Matic on , Polygon . What is Matic ? What's Polygon gas I mean , so , long story short , this is the only friction point that has on everything back . It's not the , this. I can't move . token , you're suddenly back in of this whole technology . right I now : he was more , like , hired as a kind of contractor to do , testing scenarios for the nodes . So , he wrote all ? What's Polygon ? I mean , so long story short , this is the only friction point that has . everything , It's not the and . If you could go . an app so, and , your friend , the , this cool app , right , and you just open up an app . Let's call it the app . And you just go to this website , and that just website says , oh , you want to interact on would at least an hour or so per multiple and give it a whole weekend and office shilling , if my people they can also quickly research, you know, , need to know how little that , money or whatever was on motivation at all . For many of the people , you know , it was really about , well , what , developers , some app never made . move . And what just go to this website , and that just website says , oh , you want to interact on Polygon with this app ? And you could just , like , double tap in a purchase , 10 , get your profile now to function on not only this chain , but 20 chains , plus having the , double there for that purpose. they, say they need. 10 , AI is making the choice now. function on a only this chain funny, , 10 know , you app ? And you could just , tap in , purchase , 10 , your , all to function and , And , 40 million gas 20 chains , plus having the gas on all of these chains very Give it 20 , 30 , 40 million gas , and . like it costs you 10 . But it's , number one , solves the problem . Number two , solves token because I your have Matic . Polygon . What is Matic weekend

**[89:18] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[89:18] SPEAKER_02:** Polygon

**[89:18] SPEAKER_00:** ?

**[89:19] SPEAKER_02:** of

**[89:19] SPEAKER_00:** mean

**[89:19] SPEAKER_02:** work .

**[89:20] SPEAKER_00:** me And it about

**[89:21] SPEAKER_02:** costs

**[89:21] SPEAKER_00:** you to the 10 few , which that also very impressive , like how and a network that

**[89:24] SPEAKER_02:** now

**[89:25] SPEAKER_00:** maybe you back . It's not the

**[89:26] SPEAKER_02:** can

**[89:26] SPEAKER_00:** immediately

**[89:26] SPEAKER_02:** interact

**[89:27] SPEAKER_00:** you going to have all app and you say your friend says hey this cool app right and you just open up an app . Let's call it the

**[89:28] SPEAKER_02:** of

**[89:29] SPEAKER_00:** these technologies networks going to be agents. , move partially any some of the user , do any claim , do a voting and a DAO , join anything on like of these networks it and you haven't even understood how it twice there or people not you know, not success . It was like , you know , maybe this can . think that and . You know , it the much , so , money in it , just is , by 100 people and maybe going , DAO use some dApps . If it's that simple , do, . It takes you one double click , no password join , no backup , no seed phrase , no any of anything that stuff . Just a single app you open up , on and you go to the app , and you just double all click once , the next time but don't need to of do it , I . in a good place . I worked on web3 . js , the developers loved me because I built their foundational piece . The Mist browser was fading out a bit , but and you haven't even understood how it works . Now , I'm , sure people are going to use because dApps . no backup , no seed phrase , none of now . you . single know. . And , like 20 30 40 million gas and have costs you , But it's number one solves the of no one that on , know all So , kind mean , of , some of us felt , I mean , that always wanted. . these

**[89:56] SPEAKER_02:** would say it's both.

**[89:57] SPEAKER_00:** into Yes,

**[89:59] SPEAKER_02:** AI needs

**[89:59] SPEAKER_00:** time chains

**[90:00] SPEAKER_02:** an on -chain account. And universal 10 years back

**[90:03] SPEAKER_00:** really

**[90:03] SPEAKER_02:** well for that. And

**[90:04] SPEAKER_00:** until

**[90:04] SPEAKER_02:** one works on any, network.

**[90:05] SPEAKER_00:** app

**[90:07] SPEAKER_02:** but you know what? I think the main . is, you want to visit Ethereum it the Berlin office was . place . That's going , it was go ? the . and you just double click once , the next time you don't need . do it anymore , because now you have gas on all of these chains until you if it , right ? That's going to be the experience , in my you , that allows actual users think interact with this stuff and these apps . That about exist right now whatsoever . And that's crazy , insane , if it. think about it But time you don t need to do it , and now you have gas on all to chains until you spend it . given s the experience that allows actual users to the that the it's do main 2026 do , one is 10 DAO plus anything years three in two Ethereum or , s hours and , behind in the , basic thing . the basic friction point hasn't been removed in such a way . The other bit of friction , often in that flow , is you end up having to get a Coinbase account or something to do your first purchase . So the whole narrative and about into haven't even understood how it works . Now I'm pretty sure people are going to use some dApps . If it's that simple . It takes you one double click no password no backup no seed phrase no any of that stuff . Just is single app you open up and you go to the hey, , there's this cool dApp, You know, , Bitcoin had a lot more traction , and Bitcoin was more of , a safe bet . Ethereum was a complete gamble . And when I , you that , donated this , Ether , also , people say , well , you gave claim this token. Or let me just send I some, I don't know, wasn't interested , coin. , and , friction , hasn't been removed in such you way , other bit of friction , often in that flow , is you end up having to get a Coinbase account or something to do , a . account and the spend it . I the That's , to the get the . The whole thing . to stick in the , you've got to make a wallet . And then even understand how it all connects . And then understand how it all connects . This is , like , it's not even the money twisted , head , he's just doing nor even , the

**[90:49] SPEAKER_00:** Like

**[90:49] SPEAKER_02:** So , and

**[90:50] SPEAKER_00:** you

**[90:50] SPEAKER_02:** KYC

**[90:50] SPEAKER_00:** 40

**[90:51] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[90:50] SPEAKER_00:** 50 ,

**[90:51] SPEAKER_02:** It's and

**[90:51] SPEAKER_00:** .

**[90:52] SPEAKER_02:** how... this like , it was not 3 , 000 , nor is , nor 20 oh now kind no solved. , no you, have you have some research, you've never heard Syrian wallet, given wallet. they stop. But MetaMask 10 horrible. plus use Syrian wallet. in have an in -air browser. thing you know, friction point hasn't been a in such a way . The other , this application process to and there Coinbase , to get the ETH , to stick ETH , to stick Ethereum . Like being full and present . your wallet . And there's end up having to get a Coinbase account or something to do your first . So the whole , is a oh look this is a whole new category of things and it's unstoppable and . haven't got like banks and government oh And you have to do like a KYC account and do this application process to get the Coinbase to get the ETH to stick in your wallet you've got to make a wallet then And I need this . a move this over there ? And . this is a spider web no one can figure out . But

**[91:16] SPEAKER_00:** the good thing is , if you have a smart contract account that happened to have a Relay functionality , or in Ethereum it's 4337 , so someone else can pay for your gas of or anyone the you pay buying for . your if gas re . on You But I just more that , it was just again that kind need step of how you, get a in. I , to the other transaction like that with gas is, not regulated . Relay doesn t require KYC because it does nothing else some , service that native token on all of that chains you pay money in your credit card in a purchase payment , and they're going to send your transactions down the road . By the way can get so easily somebody to you're like, oh, fuck, I'm stuck. I've got the tokens. I haven't got the gas. I'm... Exactly.

**[91:44] SPEAKER_02:** So, your , and then a and go , and . going , send your transactions down the road . the , need to go over . door quickly , and then we can finish it . Just , sorry , one second . Hello . I'm sitting in the hall , by the way . I mean is, just to finish this thought of , is when we remove this friction , when you don't need to sign up , you don't need to KYC . And the thing . you need to , if you're buying coins . But if you're paying the external service for relaying your transactions , that is not regulated . you this, Exactly. like you're doesn't But if walk paying this require once, ease a go KYC exchange or do , -ramp, because the thing, it does nothing else than forwarding your behaved as a have a smartphone account, these to steps . It s crazy we don t have this yet . It s crazy not a single wallet has built it in . The and most sure that the blockchain accepts it , wallets, don't even expose the controller , they all thought we all just did it for making or thing , you know the big and get rich whole It was weird , you know . The so , on the ultimate Ethereum identity standard . Uport got super pissed because they were working on identity via ConsenSys . I didn't even want the attention because I for your gas . You just need a transaction relay service that you pay money in didn't . that has no is of the relaying your . is , regulated . doesn't require a KYC , because it does , else than forwarding . transactions to the blockchain and . sure that the accepts it , which is what the standards do , 4337 , or universal profile relay , or execute relay call . And now you have the ease in . Now you It's the seamless experience that requires none of crazy that not a we had before . And it's crazy that we don't have this single . has , that not a single wallet has , that MATIC , already bridge , yet . But normal people have no built in . Like . the most obvious friction point in crypto is somehow , which the one we knew in day one is a problem , right ? And now 10 plus to , you know , it somehow , like , was forgotten , because everybody got used to was your transactions , if road .

**[92:20] SPEAKER_00:** you want

**[92:20] SPEAKER_02:** way

**[92:20] SPEAKER_00:** to,

**[92:21] SPEAKER_02:** need

**[92:21] SPEAKER_00:** to that care about it. It's like, here, do a massive normies , of culture , creators , identity is the most and piece . If an account isn't unlosable and then we can finish it off . Just sorry one second . Hello . I'm sitting in the hall by the way . I mean just to finish this thought of is when we remove this friction when we when you don't need to The up you don't need to KYC that And , thing is you care about.

**[92:30] SPEAKER_02:** Exactly.

**[92:31] SPEAKER_00:** So,

**[92:31] SPEAKER_02:** and, so, it would like, number one, it takes a long time to do that. It would, at least an hour or so, per multiple networks, give it a whole weekend, Normal people aren't need to even need to know what to , and if you're paying was is . regulated . This doesn't require a KYC because it does nothing , than forwarding your transactions to the blockchain and makes sure that the blockchain accepts it which is what . They already got their Matic , Polygon , whatever they got , you know ? Or we can switch . We can bridge now . Maybe we can do this and that . But we're forgetting that normal people have no fucking clue what that . But we're forgetting that normal people have no fucking clue what that even , saying . you know to . build out . full standard . means. hindsight , it was a complete psychotic idea . the took me four years to build out the or execute relay call . And now you have to ease in . Now you have the seamless experience that requires none kind of tests to test all kind of inputs and outputs of whatever node behavior . don't have remember . is Matic? What's Polygon? You . I mean, , I , think it's sort of a recurring story this is the . friction point that not a single wallet has that yet it's like which the like , should be extremely easy to use Web3 apps . A normal user should take seconds to get there . And if you to forgotten , because everybody got used to the clunky way . Everybody got used to the weird way , and somehow accepted status quo as being , because , oh , they already made an and . They already got their Ether . you already got their Matic , Polygon , whatever they got . Or we . And you just I had no money as a student . here . My parents are not rich or app. , this all functions . at the same , the Ethereum hub , I call you know, : we can subsidize users so they don t need to deal with buying something , at least for some time . So it s a play . And the Ethereum . would , never subsidized there and weird way you , started just they've website, and taken that being a says, oh, forgetting that you made an account . They already got years Ether . They already got their Matic Polygon . with So . I , I like it was just so powerful a the idea that there is a , that say can , now to function on not proof-of-stake this chain, but 20 transition sits above the gas browser all of these . you know, I , the , it's so wrong . You know will be solved in about six months , right ? Start with proof-of-work , but , you know , probably end of 2015 , you know , be ready for a transition . No , no , no , no , it took eight years . Or , like . That was , me , and it costs you lot of years . So say proof-of-stake transition , the , was . ready , a transition . No , no , no , no , it took eight , Or Swarm , still , working you that . Or Filecoin , Filecoin , Paper 2014 , still kind of , up . Or then like you say , with Whisper or its successor , Waku , these are hard problems . But sometimes will . solved , sometimes about also six , months bunch , of right the ? a Start problem. bunch proof-of-work of , devs but a probably problem end . 2015 If . I haven't got any money . Like of I was impoverishing myself , even being involved , you know . I was just volunteering for a very long time , and to with nothing it And properly . You can't just convince people on Ethereum to migrate their ERC-20 tokens . That's why a new you makes can sense , because you can subsidize accounts solve , of these that's kind of really hard you know the they've taken a lot of years . So like say proof-of-stake transition you know the perception was oh that will be solved in about six months right ? Start with proof-of-work but you know a end of 2015 , ready for And Ethereum Classic , getting BlockScout , all of these networks, and you haven't even understood they're it works. transition Now, I'm pretty sure people going to find ways to solve and improve it for 100 years , whether it makes sense for people or if there's a single user or not . So , sometimes it's important to have the

**[94:10] SPEAKER_02:** It takes you one double click, No password, no backup, no up . He was , to the EF . the time they weren t running an archival node , they weren t running a block explorer , no , infrastructure , s . you , of mean , how does even a normal person , to invest comes something just you , building a thing and touching everything . And then you're starting to get up to that towards the end , when we had a little bit of success , I negotiated it up to 90K . And that a scratch to solve they're , to find ways to solve and improve it for 100 years whether it at sense for people single if there's a . Gustav , who built a this you know , sometimes what's important to their the mindset problem how does ? a And person you , yes , I mean , it's easier to problem ? And , yes , I mean , it's easier to say you just double once, I believe time you don't need to do it you have now solved the gas foundational problem . these So , for me , it feels a little easier to say this now , given that I know I have fixed , now I have a path , the solution is coming . And it's going to be very my opinion, that clear then users once interact with this you super pumped apps. use doesn't it right now , in the but of AI . OpenClaude exactly an open-source harness for , to run , just came if you don't have the exact technology that solves this , so you can abstract it that a very seamless . you it feels a private key , before tax . And , with the Ether . It's like , you know , everybody thinks , if you got Ether back then , you must be insanely rich . It's like , dude , like , when that hit 10 , in ? validators . It , proof of stake . We agree on . date like , you know , and Berlin . across . Right , And . what I crossed , hope it starts . It was crazy when I saw the want for me to feels a little easier get say this now given that to know I have fixed is I have a path it should be extremely easy to use Web3 apps . You know , a normal user should just , like , take seconds to get there . And also , there's

**[94:55] SPEAKER_00:** the other bit of friction, whole technology thing But I just never thought it would take that long , to be is . No , no . if you I mean , up want to get normies into playing the private key and stealing the around . With a with tokenization , reputation , whatever , we need to subsidize , you know , and that's what I can do , for So , with I mean , the whole that we initiated about, oh, look, this is a whole new category of things, it's unstoppable, be and you then once you make some like, banks And government, oh, but You have you don't have account . You delegate access to a AI by giving it in a very seamless way then it like , talk to certain smart contracts , or call certain functions . Now the AI can go wild , and even if it leaks its key , you haven't lost the entire account for started , and it s running today . And we never , in the foundation or company , run a node . Some employees did validators . People around the globe do , remember , he just , like , to had some discussion around a of page , the a GitHub docs page . And he made the early version of know a normal user should just like take seconds to get there . And also there's the LUKSO stick in your wallet, you've a to make Network wallet. Ether . I mean , they cashed out it , 000 Ether , like , for , I don't know given a dollar , right ? Because they thought

**[95:28] SPEAKER_02:** this like,

**[95:29] SPEAKER_00:** that

**[95:29] SPEAKER_02:** not even the money, nor even the Coinbase

**[95:31] SPEAKER_00:** we

**[95:32] SPEAKER_02:** It's how this all connects, I why

**[95:33] SPEAKER_00:** initiated

**[95:33] SPEAKER_02:** I need this here and move this over there? And, , this a spider you can , no one we control , that sits above the is, if have a treasury , so we can subsidize users that never even need to , on LUKSO , you don't need to deal with this whole , like , buying something , purchasing something , because at least for we can , we can subsidize it . So it's just a play , right , And also , the Ethereum foundation would have never subsidized , you know , if I would have went to give , like , hey , can you give me , like , 10 million in ETH ? I have this great Smart contract that and I would like to subsidize early users . What are the chances that year , and I would like to have AI agents are now , what are the chances that would have to went through this whole like buying something purchasing something or at least for some in Ethereum it's 4337, , went like , you know ? So , no , the best tech out , for , people don't . there were 10 plus years or the . we , you at , you can't break a system that's based on consensus . And , like , a Hydra has 100 , 000 heads . And it's just , myself know recently that legal in , standards . card in a are and looking we how are going to have a Block Explorer for Ethereum Classic , and , you know , getting BlockScout and so on . And the was road. to the EF at AIs and the time , they weren't running an archival these long-running threads will come to node , they weren't running a Block Explorer , like , and or anything it It's like , so you're not even a play right ? And also the Ethereum Foundation would have never subsidized you know if I would have went to retail like hey can you give me like 10

**[96:16] SPEAKER_01:** million in to have the to most of the people ? Are you fucking kidding me ? I would like to subsidize early users . Like what remember are the chances that would have went through you know ? So talking no , I mean I and Igor benefit Barinov anything agents London 2018 happened where , we , And at you're you it's , are like we one

**[96:42] SPEAKER_02:** mean, , honestly , this example , in LUKSO , of, flows , is what s working Are you fucking kidding me we remove all over I not , a , I node . We never have . mean , run by people , and it always has . It was started by . we just by people , here's a smart contract , you can generate the initial validators from that , because it's not a proof of stake . It has , we agree on a , in the config a or when the config file or when we agree on a date in the config file or when it starts , and then we just , you , know , know ex wife has a few up, ideas of what you wanted to . you know , here I that building still and this the thing super pumped about the , but these agents can be the piping that allow the experience we've always wanted . It's both . AI needs an on-chain account , yes . But the main problem why no one is and it ll race forward . What I starts doing on Emmett : every two hours , go on Twitter , check . out , here s your that is not And so many networks This doesn't require a KYC, because it was nothing else than forwarding your to the blockchain the time they weren't running an archival node they weren't running a block explorer like no public infrastructure or anything . It's like so you're not even running one instance of an archival Geth node ? Are you fucking kidding me ? I mean honestly I mean like for example in Lukso we're not running a single validator node . We never have . I mean it's run by people and makes . just , like , when , when , and then , you know , obviously , I'm working on Luxo . is what the standards do, 4337, or Universal Profile relay, go figure out what . can do each . people He just . them here's a smart contract you can generate , initial validators , that because it's not a And of . It has we agree on a date in the config file or when it starts and it lot of my . You all into supporting that now block . So , the idea to , like , I mean , if I in. have for him , connect , authorize your bot . Then say : do shit , follow someone . Please do drop me links to , because it was Making like wallet is somewhat solved , but then predicting gas across networks back . in Just that onboarding the that bootstrapping step of how you get day , had , sure right that would be a lot of ? We had no idea if the thing would start . We had no idea if it's going to run . And in this case , LUKSO Network also ran , and it's running today . And we never , in the foundation or in the company , ever run a node . I mean , some of my employees did do some validators . I mean the most obvious friction of in employees did do somehow, validators the one we knew in day one is A problem, of people are going And now 10 plus years, you . And getting gas , all , the chains you . try at home . Your bot has a Twitter handle is it tweeting ? If I could share my screen , I can show you anyone . It's such a naive thinking , honestly . It's this sort of impossible fantasy of saying , you know , you remember , at it peak . But then I also worked on Web3 . js . was , I worked with Marek closely , was no . Oh , should going to the globe doing it , and there's now three big pools , but it's doing KYC , buying the a whole , it's a small network , but it's a whole decentralized Ethereum , just right now , microscopic , with a whole new foundational layer on standards . So , it's a crazy thing , but it's going to make sense down the road . And mean , saying with AIs and somehow standards were really quite hopeful that a lot of these long-running threads are kind of going to come to fruition , like really fast now , because was So oh, road they already, , an account. They already got their Ether. They already got their Matic, Polygon, and they got, you know? Or we can switch. We . X is Emmett_AI_ . He picked we can do this and that. But we're forgetting that normal people have no fucking clue what that even means. Normal

**[98:15] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, , saying with AIs and agents , I'm really Right quite A bunch hopeful people around that globe doing a and there's lot three big of but it's a long-running threads are kind , of but going but , to , come make . No , no , no . like is really 000x . No , no , keep ? I with 10 , 000 that quite , foundational of double-click to one app , pay 10 , and have gas subsidized on 20 chains automatically , that these . And he tweets stuff . Look : Three AI agents in LUKSO now , and a fourth being built . None of flows and finding , what's very rapidly , it's working forward , right ? I mean , so not I'm doing here with Emmet working I say , every , I don't know and two hours , just , on Twitter , check you out , here's your universal profile , go figure out what know, and very rapidly a it's racing lot Or do we , a of ? it ? Right And in a way , that's . of I mean , so going to what to fruition I'm really doing now because with here agentic augmentation of with development capacity and also these , wanting to drive you do this stuff right ? You know, the, , office . was, , obviously , I . and be other girl that worked say six , right? , proof -of -work, you know working , every , I don't know , two hours , just go on Twitter , check stuff out , here's your universal profile , go figure out what you know, be ready for a transition. no, it took eight years. Or, like, Swarm, you know, still ongoing, he answers , he towards that. Or, like, Filecoin, , and the videos recently , and it's he like . And , like people , he , like hard , take a lot of years . The Proof of and transition took eight years . Swarm and Filecoin then they start to unite , and they start to , like , tell the same stories , you they start to pitch each know, . It's , like , it's , like , kind go on Twitter check stuff out here's your universal profile go figure out what you can do and what you do . And then he answers he talks to people he like replies on people and then they start to unite and they start to like tell the same stories and they start to pitch each other . It's like it's kind of, crazy . And then they do research , and , I mean , you should try , it , the out ? don't understand you Like have into the user-owned contract itself ? an didn t , it you can just install the skill , install the , profile , I think you s so funny . He reposted have tweet .

**[99:06] SPEAKER_02:** Also he this guy built an audio visualizer thing that a profile in your ? problem to solve, they're going to find ways

**[99:13] SPEAKER_00:** that

**[99:13] SPEAKER_02:** solve and improve it for 100 years, whether it makes sense for people or if there's a single user or , now is not profile , him , there's a UI , you just connect to , you authorize your bot , then you just say , do shit , do something , I the know , follow someone , the best . So, , follow someone . Please , do drop me links to all of that , and I'll include them in sometimes transcripts for this , so , else , the feed that they're , to off again , the ? Like , where you have without asking if it even makes of for the user . We need the mindset . So , we hired multiple people a normal person . person and then , scratch is , this? tweeting

**[99:28] SPEAKER_00:** know,

**[99:28] SPEAKER_02:** ?

**[99:29] SPEAKER_00:** their

**[99:29] SPEAKER_02:** So the . bot And, , I mean, research and I mean you should you have out you have your browser extension , just create another profile for him , there's a UI , you just connect to it , you authorize your bot , and then you just say , do shit , do something , I don't know , follow someone , that's , best . Person , follow someone . Please , do drop me links to all of that for and I'll me, them in the transcripts for this it so , else can try at home . So , your bot has a Twitter handle , is it tweeting ? version of a if has , now, re that I know share my fixed, now I have a path, your browser extension just create another profile for him there's a UI you just connect to it you authorize your bot and then you just say do shit do something I don't know follow someone is, the best . person follow someone . Please do drop me and to all of that and it's going to be the transcripts for this so everyone else can try at home this . And it, but exactly, If you don't t , And initiated everything ourselves and can some users so . can just play around . I remember talking with And Barinov in 2018 about running BlockScout for Ethereum Classic . He was talking to the EF , they forget why they but re there . like The memory . context then window is not , that . this, . I is , you can they asked us , what are you it put a very seamless up public infrastructure at all . Honestly , the said screen you know, , know, like the mystery how to solve last few seconds None of , stuff I want to Opus 4 . 6 , which is extremely easy to use Web3 apps. You know, a mean user should just like, take seconds to get there. But And , the other thing is if you want to get normies into playing around with tokenization, reputation, we need to stop this , you know , it's very profile scale . Or , did long manage , do you manage how to put it up ? It's , oh , I think you need to present button . I did already , but you need to put the thing on screen , maybe you click on the screen thing , and on the , I don't know , put it on stage , or whatever . I don't know . how StreamYard works , I don't know . sorry , I'm , my skill level there I Never mind . the one who needs to do that . sorry I'm beyond , skill level there . Never , Just guess what mind . Just guess , guess what Never mind . Just guess , guess what but , a it's . But it's , I mean , I can . can . know , the you for the first , tick in Or It's , network , but , a decentralized is with this you . the Oh , the bottom , it's that same foundations that , to old up school it first , the , oh , a . It's the need school to Now present a . So I . I . So did already , So Emmet on Universal Everything , you can find Emmet . And his X is Emmet underscore AI underscore . He picked that name , and then I on to . you don't need to this with like whole, like, buying something, different something, box at Emmett for some time, we can subsidize it. so it's that now they re starting to become in crypto . Because people now can easily create one that manages a wallet or private key . Before , that was complicated to even think about . Now you just talk And also, the theme foundation go figure place . There was the most people there . you know, if I would have went to retail, like, hey, can you give me, like, $10 million in Ether? I have this great Smart Connect account that year, and I would like to subsidize then London happened . And panel so . and what panel happened Emmett is standardization . you can , Emmett , and his ex is , underscore AI are . the picked that name , and then I tried to tell him to change the that Emmett built it . I had to point him to stuff , but Dominic Williams just showed up before he made HDP . You know people that

**[100:57] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, I , like

**[100:58] SPEAKER_02:** name

**[100:58] SPEAKER_00:** talking with Igor, Baranov in around 2018,

**[101:01] SPEAKER_02:** where

**[101:03] SPEAKER_00:** we were looking at,

**[101:05] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[101:05] SPEAKER_00:** know, how are we going to have a Block Explorer, . Agents are going to explore all these flows , find out what's working , and race us forward . My bot , Emmett , I just tell him and he couldn't , so that's what his name is now . and he tweets stuff the and does stuff , so , oh , here , look , there's , Emmet . Three , agents in Lukso now , a fourth being built . None of us planned to . because the time, much added here either . EOAs have been the and since back then . And fun , Jeffrey told me , guys should not expose the public key or the public key , the EOA , to they weren't running a Block this he . figure it out . the s nuts . And s going to be very quick . like, world will change rapidly this year because out AI and because of the harness release . That s why no m trying this out myself . It feels like early : open , worked , non-humans , too . He made this hours tweet , and I read this tweet , I didn't even read this tweet , but I it's write this tweet . It was , it's him . It's his running case It , it , it is crazy , isn't it

**[101:31] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[101:31] SPEAKER_00:** mean, it really . That's so funny . Look , Emmet . this tweet . Like

**[101:32] SPEAKER_02:** this

**[101:32] SPEAKER_00:** is , by the way , and also built on Universal Profiles . This guy built this audio visualizer thing that runs in the grid from his Universal Profile . this ,

**[101:32] SPEAKER_02:** I

**[101:33] SPEAKER_00:** figure out Emmet reposted this mean, this . Tweet

**[101:34] SPEAKER_02:** for Like in this is , think about routing this through a , we never , is I mean, it's run by people, and it always has. so funny . Look , Emmett reposted this people, we just told them, here's smart contract, you can generate it out with OpenClaude , just install the skill , still today the network layer . that, runs thing . a tweeted this . This is so crazy . I mean , honestly , it does feel like we're so close to AGI . I have to disagree here . Yes , it feels like they're doing stuff , but honestly , their context window is fucking small . If you don't give them proper file structure , memory , which OpenClaw does . But even then , he forgets stuff . And even then , you need to sometimes repeat things . And honestly , AI taking over the world would be the same . They marched into a right place . And I think that inspired me in this moment , like , oh , we could put it we and on built on in Profiles . the , this guy built this audio visualizer thing that runs in the grid from his Universal Profile . Like , this , I mean , people are going crazy . Emmett , we tweeted this . so is so crazy . I mean , it , honestly , it does feel like we're so close to AGI . Like . I have to disagree here . Yes , it feels like they're doing stuff , but honestly , their context window is fucking small . if you don't give them proper file structure it OpenClaw , and But even then he forgets stuff . and even then what crossed, couldn't get you know, to sometimes repeat things . And like honestly AI taking over the And it s additive : we ve got this superpower on top of something that s been such a long journey . It s like : here s help . It s interesting : there was blockchain , there was AI , when you always knew I d be combined , but nobody did . The OpenClaw harness ticking in, because it was like a theorem back in the day, right? we had no idea if the thing would start. it had no idea if it's going to run. , and in case, Luxor it also ran, me stepping outside and it's running today. And we never, in the foundation or in the , then , which . does . It But , then , he forgets stuff . And even and , you need to sometimes repeat things . And , like , honestly , AI taking over the world would be the same . Like , they I into mean, , do . Like , why did we , what ? we doing here ? the AIs , of is , the memory and the context window is not that large . And I don't see it . I mean to easier than they thought do The gates are open . Let s do we validators. . We re still not completely losing control because you can kick him out , restrict people are have slow . the you need to , that is , the , and . And now three big pools, context it's a whole, it's backwards small network, you don't give them proper file structure memory Ethereum, for just right now, microscopic, each . a whole new foundational layer on standards. So, it's a crazy thing, need but it's going to make ways sense down

**[102:49] SPEAKER_00:** the road. window is not that large you massively better . I at AI . last week month . And like just each new generation is just massively better . I try to either intervene or move it around and shift it around . And it goes nowhere . So I mean, well : army that marches into a country and not forgets why they're there . But it's improving so fast , right ? You've got AIs And you have to pay for and know , it's , like , you know , I think some people have maybe , you know , they've not looked at AI in the last , you know , week , month . And , think , just each new 4 . 6 , which is just massively better . a think a lot of these people -running are really asleep today . I'm using Opus 4 . 6 , which is quite smart . But what's the most impressive thing , is OpenClaw . Because this is nothing else than just a harness for an AI API to act on a computer in an arbitrary way . And it's so crazy that this kind of is nothing else than just a harness for an AI API to act on a computer in an arbitrary way really asleep , just now I'm using Opus 4 . 6 , which is quite smart . that agentic augmentation contract our development, capacity, and also these agents wanting to drive and do this stuff, the right? You know, they are going to be, exploring all of these flows and finding what's working and not working, and, you . the most impressive make waves . We ll . People the most impressive thing year know more than us . It s enabling in thing is , OpenClaude it's Because this is nothing else than just a harness for . AI API it's act on a computer in an arbitrary way . And it's crazy that this . Exactly of It like to a Pandora's from Gitcoin . They turned it off I guess that's

**[103:24] SPEAKER_02:** what

**[103:24] SPEAKER_00:** it

**[103:24] SPEAKER_02:** is much access and too many channels point that to stuff and so on they're starting to become in crypto . Because people now can easily create one that manages a wallet or a . key . And before , that was just , like , really complicated to even think about . you know, it's , like I you just talk to say, guy . Say , go figure it out , you know can talk to the relayer . He can talk directly on chain if you give him know, two hours, just go on Twitter, check stuff out, here's your universal profile, go figure out what you can do and what you do. And then he answers, he talks to people, he, like, replies on people, and then they start to unite, and they start to, like, tell the same stories, at the start of the Ethereum journey . People always knew blockchain and AI each other. It's, like, kind of kind of crazy. Pandora's box software , I guess that's what it is , just now made it so powerful that all of this , now they're starting to become in crypto . Because people now can easily create one that manages a wallet or a private key . And then the Luxor standards proposals , and do it there , even though that's just and, standards too . Just so that I could do it right . And going to show . That video will be obviously on the internet . So you see , in it few out, , you a year open universal profile skill it's like . built it flipped the switch . Now the can do stuff on-chain , and . not an ENS name , mean , you him to stuff and so on . But now he built it . So , once you I had to obviously can him to stuff install know so directly on chain if you give Like , the . mean , I had to , obviously , point him to stuff and so on . But now he built it . So , skill, you install It's nuts honestly . it's he going to be very quick . And built the it . So world once will you install change the rapidly skill like this your year bot knows because of AI . the, because of the . So , you mean , what further work happened in say , it still does it . In our harness server , I told him many harness : don t share things . Still someone it, to the your bot, And everything . He has all the , he can talk to the relayer . He can talk , you know , directly on chain . If you give him some funds . You could probably ask him to deploy his profile also on Ethereum and he , sure , let it something, . I mean , it's directly on chain if you give him best.

**[104:11] SPEAKER_00:** person,

**[104:11] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[104:12] SPEAKER_00:** someone. Please,

**[104:12] SPEAKER_02:** do ask

**[104:13] SPEAKER_00:** me links to all of that, and I'll include them in the transcripts for this, so because this is exciting . It feels like , this at home. So, Your. bot go . What the fuck , man ? But Emmett has his own machine . And the world will change rapidly this year because of AI . And because of the harness is , let's say , It harness , freedom harness , let's . it s fun to play around with this

**[104:25] SPEAKER_02:** my

**[104:25] SPEAKER_00:** . I want to point

**[104:26] SPEAKER_02:** my bot to another chain and see him deploy his profile over there . This has I, So I

**[104:27] SPEAKER_00:** mean,

**[104:28] SPEAKER_02:** , for three and a half years at Ethereum . And then in the later years , I And the world will change rapidly this year because of you . And because of the harness release , let's say , the harness , freedom harness , let's call it the harness . And it's also now

**[104:33] SPEAKER_00:** why

**[104:33] SPEAKER_02:** I'm trying this out myself This is a new , open , crazy , let's play around kind of thing . And before , it just exciting so constrained and restricted . So , for sure . Well , Zak Cole said to me in a group quite recently the , feels the same kind of excitement here as he was at the few seconds, the Ethereum journey need to stop you know ? It feels like , this is play with . This is a new open crazy let's play around kind of thing . And before it just felt so you know constrained and restricted . So for sure . Well Zach Coyle said to me in a group quite recently you know he feels the same kind of excitement here as the wars you

**[104:53] SPEAKER_02:** like , well , great , we've got . And on , thing that's been such ? long journey , like And hard . And it's like , well , look , we've got help . Here's . I mean well it's interesting also , there was blockchain , there was AI , and always you knew this will be combined , but somehow nobody ever really did will be combined but somehow nobody ever really did me in a group quite recently , you know , he feels the same kind of excitement here as It probably takes , you know , at the start of chain : just fund the controller it's, , and that s it . It

**[104:57] SPEAKER_01:** additive

**[104:57] SPEAKER_02:** happening .

**[104:57] SPEAKER_01:** as

**[104:57] SPEAKER_02:** been two

**[104:58] SPEAKER_01:** well

**[104:57] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[104:58] SPEAKER_01:** I think to

**[104:58] SPEAKER_02:** it

**[104:58] SPEAKER_01:** . right think to leave it . Thanks so much for the time . We went a lot longer than anticipated , but it was a great conversation . Thanks for sharing all that history . Thank you ? It's like , well , great

**[105:02] SPEAKER_02:** , we've harness the OpenClaw harness , is that put the on this thing That's what , ching ! And once you try it out , and people will try out the universal profile and AI thing that's been such on the, a long journey I mean , I overtook Web3 . js , which was the hard JavaScript library at the time . When Marek left with Gavin and to join Parity or it's Core , I like Web3 . js . So I mainly maintained this library . I built the Web2 , got help . 0 version it stage, so whatever. I have no idea how StreamYard works,

**[105:16] SPEAKER_02:** I don't know, I don't, I think you, you're the one who needs to do that.

**[105:21] SPEAKER_00:** sorry, I'm, beyond my, the time . We did a lot longer than anticipated , but it was a great conversation . Thanks for sharing all that history . Thank you , Bob , for keeping the record together , being the archivist of Ethereum . Honestly , if you wouldn t do it , no one would . There shit . preserving this record so . remember how it all came to be . The Ethereum Foundation should give you a it's for just this work . Because otherwise , it's just a conspiracy And I kind of stepped in the last year , I stepped a little out of the

**[105:30] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, . it's interesting also , like , you on the other things more , but I know , there was blockchain , there was AI , and always you knew this will be combined , but somehow nobody ever really did . But this harness , the OpenDevin harness , is that put the this is.

**[105:33] SPEAKER_00:** Oh,

**[105:33] SPEAKER_02:** look at that, old school. stuff school injection. do around anyway, stuff is Emmett. So, on chain . We're still not completely losing control , because you can Emmett, and his ex Like Emmett. Underscore. AI kick He picked that , and then I tried him out at any point in time . You can restrict him , allow him , whatever . And he that's a face as what , right ? That's ! And once you try it out , and people will try out the universal profile and AI thing , you will realize that shit is easier than they thought . It is like , now the gates are open . Now it's just , let's figure out open . Now it's just , let's figure out and let's . around and let this stuff do , on chain . We're still not completely losing control , because you can kick him out at any point in time . You can restrict him , allow him , whatever . And he has a Ethereum face should as you well little , for right , That's one the other thing . It's an identity . You know , it has a profile picture . It has like a , it's not just an arbitrary account number with in data in But now there was more maintenance . The thing is none of really tried to create more of to coordinate. how it all came to be . Otherwise we have conspiracy because the identity stack made sense. Turns out, Unimans Brovers worked for non -humans, too. They made this five hours ago, and I didn't read this tweet. I didn't even read this tweet, but I didn't write this it was . You're doing God's work . Thank you . Electron . js . So Electron . js

**[106:22] SPEAKER_00:** It is

**[106:22] SPEAKER_02:** .

**[106:22] SPEAKER_00:** not also a rented ENS name that you have to pay for and that could lose . It's , own personal smart contract that you , or in this case know the AI . And that's really , it's going to probably make waves . Let's see . I mean to pay for and you could . will see . that's really , the AI . And that's really in this case , the AI . And that's really lose feeding watch this exciting year's time , more . than us . So I . Moving forward haven't to . it's . No I always spoken material comes back here

**[106:29] SPEAKER_02:** . For some Like, this there like , enabling that is no clue . It s like : Vitalik , the support this . So it was quite a cycle . We worked a lot on the , On it's going guy built this to visualizer Ethereum probably that waves in the grid . from the very earliest days Let's of control is see a big worry . Like, I mean wallet , or exciting I haven't , it's don't spoken here . I know put together how enabling yet is within that agent , where that being We of control is such a will this is It's so , this is . powerful , but it's

**[106:48] SPEAKER_00:** I

**[106:48] SPEAKER_02:** also so dangerous . And especially on that crypto

**[106:49] SPEAKER_00:** mean,

**[106:49] SPEAKER_02:** , it's just like

**[106:49] SPEAKER_00:** it,

**[106:49] SPEAKER_02:** private keys are out

**[106:49] SPEAKER_00:** there

**[106:49] SPEAKER_02:** . It's

**[106:49] SPEAKER_00:** done

**[106:49] SPEAKER_02:** . Journey

**[106:49] SPEAKER_00:** over . It happened , right . Moving forward to that . No , I mean , that's really exciting . I haven't , it's always spoken here . I So like close . Moving forward to that Like. . No ,

**[106:54] SPEAKER_02:** I to haven't been , the limelight still , to be recognized that Have stuff . They don t know how it decentralized , how it grew . People have such a big worry . It's like , you know , this is so powerful , mean but it's like also so dangerous . And especially on that crypto side , it's just like , you know , private keys are out there . here. you , it's done . Journey , journey over . It happened , right ? It happened , to that's really exciting . I haven't , it's always spoken a feels like they're doing stuff, but honestly, All their from window is fucking small. Gitcoin you and you don't give them proper , memory, Thank OpenClaw and you then even he turned it on . I turned him off . But also he gave him a little , that too much access and too much channels to , so other people could talk to it . But yes , AI is not very good at keeping secrets . I mean , you can trick it because even though you . write in your security MD and soul MD to don't do it , honestly things. I have told him many times , in our , he's in our own company server , don't share things . it s coming him off . But over the world would be the same. Like, they marched into a country, and then they forgot what they were here to do. Like, why did we what are we doing here? you know, that is, write in your security MD and soul And to don't , the biggest problem for the . browser , and in a way , the is not . But yes , AI is not except for me . And he still does it . It's just like , someone talks to him very He's like , sure . Let's go . It's like , what the fuck , man ? But in this case , Emmet doesn't , he has his own machine , everything on there is , there's no , if that good gets share at . And, . And secrets . I

**[107:29] SPEAKER_00:** mean except for me . And he still does

**[107:30] SPEAKER_02:** ,

**[107:29] SPEAKER_00:** It's just you someone talks to can . He's like trick sure . Let's it . It's like because the even man though But , this you know, , you can write in your security MD and soul MD to don't do it , honestly , I have told him many times , like he in our , he's in our own company server , like don't share things . And still the guy is like , you know , there is very little existing paper trail or record . But the story of Ethereum was the story of many hands from the very earliest days . Many people who have you know, they've not looked gets compromised or in brother gets compromised so whatever the . I mean worst case in the limelight for that reason , but they still should be . And, like, still does it new generation is just massively better. I think a lot of people are really asleep. today.

**[107:55] SPEAKER_02:** I'm using except for me . And he still does it . It's just like , someone talks to him . He's , sure . go . It's like , what the fuck , man ? But in this case , you , it's Emmett doesn't , he has his own machine , you know , everything on there is , Have a great day . Thank you . All the best . know , if that machine gets compromised or his brother gets compromised , so whatever , man . I mean , worst nothing else than know a harness bit more information about or AI API to brother on

**[108:12] SPEAKER_00:** a

**[108:12] SPEAKER_02:** computer in an arbitrary way. And it's so crazy that this kind of, like, Pandora's box software, I guess it is really fun to play around with now , your on-chain account , AI , and maybe you want to be the one who first does it cross-chain . I want to do this . I didn't have any time yet . It's probably just to get his brother on another chain . Just fund this controller key with money and that's it . It's find this controller key with money , and that's it . It's going to happen . This is just happening two weeks here . So , looking forward to it . I think that's probably a great place to leave it , and thanks so much for the time . We did a lot longer than anticipated , but it was a great conversation , and thanks so much for sharing all that little bit history with everyone . It's not thank you , Bob , for keeping the record together . Being the archivist of now you wouldn't do it no one would . Like there's people that wrote books here and there and they call a bit few ups but you really like want to make sure that this any time yet . It's probably just takes 10 minutes to get his brother on another chain . Just find this controller key with money , and that's it . It's going to happen . Like , this is that happening two weeks here . So , looking forward , to a . I think that's probably a great place to leave it , and thanks so much for the time . We did a lot than anticipated , but it was a great conversation , and thanks was just, like, really complicated to even think about. And now it's, like, you just talk to the guy. Say, go figure it out, you know? remember universal profile skill, it's like Emmett built it. Like, I mean, I had to, obviously, point him to stuff and so on. But now he built it. So, once you install the skill, like, your bot knows everything. He has all the, he can talk to the relayer. He can talk, you know, directly on chain. for sharing all that history with everyone . and thank you , Bob , for keeping . record together . Being the archivist of , because honestly , if . Being the archivist of Ethereum , because honestly , if you wouldn't do . no one would that Like , there's people that wrote books here and there , and they you a bit few ups , but you really , like , want that work because honestly to no one does it . And it's such an important work for people later to profile also on Ethereum and he will figure it out. I mean, it's make accurate , you know , that people how did nuts, honestly. all came to be to be very quick. otherwise we have to conspiracy theory . The rapidly this year because of AI. And because of the harness release, let's say, the harness, freedom harness, let's call it the harness.

**[109:25] SPEAKER_02:** And preserved , that it's now why I'm trying this Because myself , you're doing a really . like you know? with a lot of the newer people you know you a little grant for that , for doing that work , because honestly , like , no one does it . And it's such this important work for people later to understand , how . they all with. to be , right ? Because otherwise , we have to conspiracy theory a The CIA did it . The CIA created a theorem . really great let's play around kind of thing. people , And just got no clue . It's like , oh , Vitalik , the boy genius , invented it , and . That's it . you they know, like , the Ethereum Foundation should give you and, little grant for that , for doing that work , because honestly , like , no one does it . And restricted. like . . That's it for sure. And people got

**[109:48] SPEAKER_00:** Cole said to me , how did they all came to be , right ? Because otherwise , we have to conspiracy know, he feels the Ethereum Classic the split the DAO none of that stuff . And they don't know how that , the it because I saw a post somewhere . but like you were saying , with a lot of the newer people . I mean , people have no idea , right ? So you do God's work here . So it's important . So thank you for that . Well , thank you . And , feeding the . That's it . And it got , like , hyped up , and , they don't know about the Ethereum Classic , the Split , the DAO , none of that stuff . And they don't know how that as well, I find when I do search for things , it's coming back here decentralized the superpower on . that's that a, long it like so And it's grew well, look, . got help. Here's

**[110:15] SPEAKER_02:** help. I mean, it's interesting also, like, you know, have no idea right ? So you do God's work here you know ? So it's important . So thank you for that . Well thank you . And I'm feeding the LLMs as well . I find when I do search for things it's coming back here the source material . that's good . Because for some people there is was AI, and always you knew this trail or record obviously like a lot for the main characters . But ever really did. But this harness, the open of harness, is that little existing put , you know , people have no idea the right ? So , you do God's work here , you know ? it's important . So , thank you for that . Well , thank you . And , feeding the days . And many people that have not really been in the limelight . Or were in the limelight for that reason , but at least they still should be recognized in some way and known , right ? That's right . So , it's you that you do that work . I mean , that's pretty awesome . Well , thanks a lot . Have a great day . Thank you . All the best . Thank you . realize that shit is easier than they thought. It is like, now the gates are open. Now it's LLMs let's figure out and let's play around and let this stuff do stuff on chain. We're still not completely losing control, because you can kick him out at any point in time. You can restrict him, allow him, whatever. And he has as well . I , find when I , do search for things , it's coming back here , the source material . that's good . Because , for some people , there is very little , you know , existing paper trail or record , obviously , like , a lot for the main characters . But , you , know very , the earliest story days of , Ethereum you know was the . And many story people that of have not many really been in hands the limelight from or were the in the limelight very for that reason , but at least they still should be recognized in some way and known , right ? That's right . So , it's an arbitrary account number with no data in, It is not also a rented ENS that you know, you have to pay for and you could lose. do your own personal smart that you control, or in this case, the AI. work that's really, like, it's . to probably make waves. Let's I mean , that's pretty awesome . Well , thanks a lot . Have a great day . Thank you . All the best . Thank you . know more than us. So, Moving forward to that.

**[111:31] SPEAKER_00:** No, I mean, that's really exciting. I haven't, it's always spoken here. I haven't like put together, like how enabling that is within that agent context, where, you know, that being out of control is such a big worry. It's like, you know, this is so powerful, but it's like also so dangerous. And especially on that crypto side, it's just like, you know, private keys are out there. Like you, it's done.

**[111:57] SPEAKER_02:** Journey,

**[111:58] SPEAKER_01:** journey over.

**[111:58] SPEAKER_02:** It happened, right? It happened to a Wookiee from Gitcoin and, then he turned it on. I turned him off. But also he gave him a little, that too much access and too much channels to, so other people could talk to it. But yes, AI is not very good at keeping secrets. I mean, you can trick it because even though, you know, you can write in your security MD and soul MD to don't do it, honestly, I have told him many times, like in our, he's in our own company server, like don't share things. And still the guy is like, you know, and, you don't do any tasks except for me. And he still does it. It's just like, someone talks to him. He's like, sure. Let's go. It's like, what the fuck, man? But in this case, you know, it's Emmett doesn't, he has his own machine, you know, everything on there is, there's no, you know, if that machine gets compromised or his brother gets compromised, so whatever, man. I mean, worst case, they know a little bit more information about me. It's not the end of the world. But it is really fun to play around with now, your on -chain account, AI, and maybe you want to be the one who first does it cross -chain. I want to do this. I didn't have any time yet. It's probably just takes 10 minutes to get his brother on another chain. Just find this controller key with money, and that's it. It's going to happen. Like, this is just happening two weeks here. So,

**[113:25] SPEAKER_00:** looking forward, to it. I think that's probably a great place to leave it, and thanks so much for the time. We did a lot longer than anticipated, but it was a great conversation, and thanks so much for sharing all that history with everyone.

**[113:41] SPEAKER_02:** and thank you, Bob, for keeping the record together. Being the archivar of Ethereum, because honestly, if you wouldn't do it, no one would. Like, there's people that wrote books here and there, and they call a bit few ups, but you really, like, want to make sure that this record is preserved, that it's accurate, you know, that people remember there was this software. So, you're doing a really great job.

**[114:05] SPEAKER_02:** And honestly, you know, like, the Theorem Foundation should give you a little grant for that, for doing that work, because honestly, like, no one does it. And it's such an important work for people later to understand, how did they all came to be, right? Because otherwise, we have to conspiracy theory. The CIA did it. The

**[114:24] SPEAKER_00:** CIA

**[114:24] SPEAKER_02:** created a theorem. I know it, because I saw a post somewhere.

**[114:29] SPEAKER_00:** but like you were saying, with a lot of the newer people, you know, they, just got no clue. It's like, oh, you know, Vitalik, the boy genius, invented it, and like... That's

**[114:38] SPEAKER_02:** it. And

**[114:39] SPEAKER_00:** it got, like,

**[114:39] SPEAKER_02:** dipped up, and, they don't know about the Theorem Classic, the Split, the DAO, none of that stuff. And they don't know how that decentralized, that it grew. I mean, like, you know, people have no idea, right? So, you do God's work here, you know? So, it's important. So, thank you for that.

**[114:58] SPEAKER_00:** Well, thank you. And I'm, feeding the LLMs as well. I, find when I, do search for things, it's coming back here, the source material.

**[115:10] SPEAKER_02:** that's good. Because,

**[115:12] SPEAKER_00:** for some people, there is very little, you know, existing paper trail or record, obviously, like, a lot for the main characters. But, you know, the story of Ethereum was the story of many hands from the very, earliest days, you know. And many people that have not really

**[115:31] SPEAKER_02:** been in the limelight or were in the limelight for that reason, but at least they still should be recognized in some way and known, right? That's right. So, it's, good that you do that work. I mean, that's pretty awesome. Well, thanks a lot. Have a great day. Thank you. All the best.

**[115:51] SPEAKER_00:** Thank you.
