SPEAKER_00: So hello, and welcome to Early Days of Ethereum. I am delighted today to be joined by Fabian Vogelsteller. Is that the correct pronunciation?

SPEAKER_01: Like an F. The V is more like an F. But yes.

SPEAKER_00: Right, very Germanic pronunciation. That’s not going to come out of my mouth. So yeah, great to see you. We saw each other at Devconnect in November, I think, for the first time in quite a while, and had a good catch-up there. But hello.

SPEAKER_01: So hey, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: What were you doing prior, wandering into the blockchain world?

SPEAKER_01: Okay, let’s start from the beginning. Before blockchain, I was actually a web developer. I started out building websites since I was 14. My “Findura”—the name that I have on Twitter—is actually the name of the content management system that I built, I think, in 2005. It just happened to turn into my second identity. So I have two identities on the internet: “frozeman” and “Pandura.” It’s all just connected to two things on GitHub. I’m “frozen,” and that’s also my GitHub history with Ethereum and so on, and “Pandura” is then my online one.

I was always interested in the cutting edge of the cool internet stuff in the ’90s—building my first websites in the early 2000s, or 1998, 1999—following the whole evolution of the internet with HTML 1 and 2, CSS 1 and 2, JavaScript coming in, and blah blah blah. So I mainly did web development, but I studied media design, so I didn’t study anything with coding. All the coding is autodidactically learned.

Honestly, even when I joined Ethereum, I had no clue about bytes and how to manipulate bytes and stuff. Still don’t, actually. I still don’t know.

SPEAKER_00: Didn’t have your computer science background. I don’t have any computer science background.

SPEAKER_01: I’m not sure what—I don’t know what I’m doing on the computer. I just know how to interact with high-level languages, and now I only know how to speak to AI and to my team.

SPEAKER_00: That’s all you need. Things changed and you wrote a book.

SPEAKER_01: I wrote a book about Meteor.js. So yeah, I got really into web development. I did a lot of websites and built a lot of things. I built my own content management system in PHP, and I built a flat-file-based content management system. So that means it doesn’t need a database.

The whole idea was: okay, I just want to have one of these FTP, PHP-ready servers, and if I want to move my—literally, it was all about the independence of hosting providers, right? If I want to move from this hosting provider to the other: back in the day migrating databases was a nightmare, and probably still is. If I build a flat-file-based thing, you just copy the whole folder structure over to the other server and it works. And it did. So that’s what findura.org CMS does and did.

I mean, obviously, who uses PHP today? But Facebook does. But yeah—now I have a bunch of haters in the PHP community.

So I built that thing, and that really helped me do a full project front to end. Then I got more into JavaScript, and I got really excited by Meteor.js, which was one of the first reactive JavaScript frameworks. That was before Angular, before React. It was the first time where you just could write JavaScript code and this HTML stuff, and when you update stuff in the JavaScript, or in your local state, the HTML got rerendered natively. Super magic.

So I got really into this, and I wrote a book about it. I have it here if you ever want to—I would never read a tutorial book, to be honest, but I wrote one.

SPEAKER_00: People even read books anymore.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Honestly, I would never even—it was so much work to do this. The reason why I did it is because they reached out to me and I thought, “Yeah, I could do that.” And then Marjorie, my ex-wife back in the day, encouraged me, and I thought, “Okay, why not?” And in the end it was a lot of work.

Literally four months of waking up—and I had a kid, two-year-old kid at the time, or maybe a year old, I don’t remember—and I had to wake up very early at five to write one or two, three pages, or five pages, whatever, and then go to work. It was intense. You get an hourly rate of like 10 cents. So it made totally no money. I literally probably made like exactly 10 cents per hour or something like this.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: But it’s reputation, and in a way I think that also is what got me into Ethereum. Because what is writing single-page apps with Meteor? And what is a dapp? It’s a single-page app.

SPEAKER_00: It’s—

SPEAKER_01: The whole point: it literally runs in your browser, doesn’t require a backend. And I built actually a tool that allowed you to strip out the server part of the Meteor app so you can handle it as a local app. It was quite a popular repository called Meteor Build Client. And yeah, that’s what I used for dapps in the early days in Ethereum too.

SPEAKER_00: Is Meteor still an active project? Is anyone using Meteor too?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no, I totally think so. I think so, yeah. I don’t know how frequent they are. I haven’t checked it out in a long time.

SPEAKER_00: But I mean, it was quite a revolution at the time, the single-page app.

SPEAKER_01: It was one of the first. It was the first framework that I know that really was a proper framework, and it solved the whole thing from account creation to reactive DOM updates to server/client synchronization. It was magic. It blew a lot of people away.

And then all the other—React and so on—were kind of more like answers to this. And then React brought it back to the weird way of mixing code and UI in the same files, which I already found very bad in PHP times.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: And then I guess you maybe found your way into the Bitcoin world in some form.

SPEAKER_01: So, yeah. 2013, I heard about “a Canadian wants to sell house in Bitcoin.” And I thought, okay, wow, what’s that? Like somebody’s selling a house in a currency I’ve never heard of. That really led me very quickly down the rabbit hole.

This was 2013, March. That was literally when Bitcoin hit 200 in that very same month. Number one, I saw: okay, there’s money to be made here. And I was a student with no money. So you try, you hope: okay, maybe I can make a little bit of money on the side this way.

But I really quickly understood the fundamental power of this technology. It took me about a year to really understand how it works fully. I literally had this epiphany every month where I thought, “Now I know how it works.” It took me a year to really contort my brain: no servers and frameworks, and how this basic stuff works. The crypto blockchain stuff was so out there, the way it works.

But yeah, so I was in the space. And obviously right after I joined the Bitcoin community, then there was the first altcoin, Litecoin. And then in 2013 there were a lot of projects that were created trying to imitate Bitcoin, or do an improvement, or do alternate versions.

I also got really into Mastercoin, the idea of just writing onto the Bitcoin blockchain rather than creating a separate blockchain.

SPEAKER_00: Right. And you’re in Berlin, right? Were you going to meetups, or did you find fellow—

SPEAKER_01: It was just online. There were no meetups at the time, really. Not in my region. What actually happened: later, 2014, there were then some meetups. And so I heard about Ethereum.

I really knew immediately that this is a really powerful approach, but it also sounded so unrealistic. When I heard—when I looked at the white paper, I never really read the Ethereum white paper fully. I literally just skipped over it. I listened to Vitalik and the early things that were floating around, and I knew this is it.

The idea of making this computation machine on the blockchain makes total sense. I just thought it’s so hard to do. I didn’t really give it a lot of chances that they’d pull this off. But then they pulled it off pretty quickly.

It just happened that I was at a meetup in Berlin, a Bitcoin meetup—I think the first one I was ever at.

SPEAKER_00: Right.

SPEAKER_01: They wanted to open a Bitcoin Center Berlin, a coworking space basically.

SPEAKER_00: Can you imagine what kind of month that might have been?

SPEAKER_01: That might have been August 2014. It was literally like a week before the Ethereum presale started.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right.

SPEAKER_01: Literally days before. So I met these guys from Ethereum. In this case it was Aaron, who did the accounting at the time.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: And they told me that they are going to open an office in Berlin, and that there’s some kind of news coming out next week, but he can’t tell me. And I was already following Ethereum. I was already waiting for the ICO. And yeah, then it happened.

So I took all my Bitcoin that I had at the time, which was 12 bitcoins, converted them into ether. People think like, “Oh my God, 12 bitcoins,” but they were like 600 worth or whatever. It was literally not much. I put pretty much everything into ether. And I knew this is going to be big. I felt it.

This was also the first time a project where I thought I would love to work for this project, because it’s not about finance, money, and wallets. Every Bitcoin startup at the time was just about creating a wallet. I wasn’t really interested in creating wallets.

So it just happened that six months later—ICO happened, attention came, blah blah blah—I got an email from a recruiter saying the company “Ethereum” is looking for a C developer. And I was not a C developer. Recruiters don’t check anything on LinkedIn, I guess, or GitHub.

But I knew that they’re now looking. So I went to their office and I chatted with Aaron again, and I saw this office at Waldemarstraße. And I realized: okay, they’re really just thinking that they’re going to build the nodes and then people will build on top of the stack.

And I just knew: I know how to build single-page apps; this is what you need. I knew this is what they will need: to show what a dapp can be, and how to build. I just felt it.

So I said, “Aaron, just ask around internally.” And they had one Skype group that was kind of like the Discord group at the time.

Funny enough, Alex van de Sande is the one who came on board as the UX designer also just a month before me. He had this whole idea of creating this Mist browser concept. And I think when Alex heard about that there’s this guy that came up here that can build single-page apps, then Alex thought, “Oh, that could be the person who can help with building the Mist browser.”

So he convinced Jeff—this is my assumption what happened—and he tried to call me up, and I was in Turkey on holiday, so I didn’t pick up the phone. When I came back, I saw someone called me up, and I called him back or whatever, and he said, “Hey, you want to work here? We want to do this and this and…” and this was Alex.

SPEAKER_00: That you were talking to again?

SPEAKER_01: No, this was Alex. So I was talking to Alex. Alex wanted to have me because I think he probably convinced Jeff, because he saw this as a guy who can help build his idea, right? And Jeffrey was kind of skeptical of hiring anyone that’s not a C developer. “What the hell can you do?” I guess is what he thought. “JavaScript cannot work.”

SPEAKER_00: So you started in—was it January 2015? So I guess this discussion would have been in December 2014.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly. Yeah. It was mid-December. I was on holidays, he tried to call me, and he said, “Hey, can you start?” He asked when to start. He said, “Start in January.”

And Jeffrey obviously really wanted to prove me, so he thought, “Okay, let me just throw a really complicated task at him, and he’ll fail anyway, and we can get over with this whole thing.” I think that’s what Jeffrey thought.

So he said, “Okay, build a chat app for the Whisper protocol.”

In Ethereum there was Web3, right? The idea of Web3 was: the network, storage—Swarm storage—and communication—Whisper. Which, by the way, I only figured out later that “Web3” means exactly these three things. Fun fact: I always thought it’s like, sure, Web2, we go to Web3. But that was actually the three—probably both.

SPEAKER_00: Right. It’s kind of a bit of a joke that you’ve got both. And I was just looking: it was November that Alex had done his Mist concept presentation. So I guess that was really quite fresh. It’s like, okay.

SPEAKER_01: So he had the idea, and they were working on it already early December. And I forgot his name, but the French guy who then worked on Remix—I’m sorry, I forgot.

SPEAKER_00: Jan Laborer.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly. So Jan actually built an early version of the Mist browser, but in, I think, C or something like this, and browser—I think there—

SPEAKER_00: There was one called fbrowser.

SPEAKER_01: Maybe it was really early Mist. It was barely working, and obviously the whole idea connection stuff was not figured out properly yet. They realized quickly that this is not the way to go. And that’s why maybe Alex saw an opportunity here with this JavaScript dude showing up with the single-page app book or whatever.

SPEAKER_00: You’d had AlethZero as well, right? I guess that was the very first GUI thing. Maybe that’s what you were thinking of with Jan.

SPEAKER_01: Maybe AlethZero was that early Mist browser. Exactly. Yeah. Anyway—so Jeffrey said, “Let the guy build a chat app in the Whisper protocol.” I got dropped into this novel tech: no documentation, no idea how the shit works. I was supposed to build a whole chat app using this protocol. That was crazy.

But because I really knew how to build reactive single-page apps, I could work with Jan. He gave me just the endpoints that I needed to use to get the account and to send the messages and stuff like this. I pulled it off and built a chat app.

The first time we met in March or April, all together in Amsterdam, we all used the Whisper chat app to talk to each other: encrypted chat messaging, including groups. I added topics—so in a channel you could say, “I want to talk about a certain topic,” and then you could filter by the topic, so you could see all messages, or only this or that topic.

It’s the same like threads in Discord, by the way. So I basically made the thread concept of Discord in this tiny app, and it worked. You were connected with your wallet that was in your node, in your geth store.

And I think Jeffrey was quite impressed, and that kind of gave him some confidence that I can do it, even though he was trying to prove me wrong.

SPEAKER_00: No—

SPEAKER_01: And what’s crazy is we literally built the Mist browser in like three months. We built the first working version, and we released it with mainnet. We released the Ethereum Wallet—that was July 31, 2015. So basically six months later, seven months later, we released the first Mist browser version.

It was so crazy because everything needed to be figured out. I needed to learn how all this stuff works. Initially, in the first two months, it felt literally impossible. I felt like there’s no way I’m going to figure this shit out.

There was no documentation. It was completely over my head in terms of complexity and shit that I didn’t understand at all. But I pulled it off. Obviously there were people around me that I could talk to, but everybody was also so busy and had to figure out their own thing, because everything had to be figured out at the time.

But I had to literally touch every point. I had to work with the RPC API, and then I saw this thing was kind of messy. Sometimes it was returning hex, sometimes it was not returning. So I thought—I’m a Virgo—so I immediately tried to fix things and make them proper. I immediately wanted to make sure this is proper, because when we launch nodes, this stuff can’t change anymore. Once we start mainnet, you don’t want to constantly make dev stuff unworkable. So I had to fight with Gavin to fix and change the endpoints, and that was already a bit of an uphill battle.

Then I had to get into web3.js, which Marek was working on with Russ—a JavaScript library that I think Gavin and Jeffrey started—and I had to help with him or work together with him initially. Then I really contributed to web3.js because we had to build that into the Mist browser directly. So I was literally the first user of that library and really contributed to that library as well.

We had to make everything up. The whole foundational stack of Ethereum we made up in the first few months. And because I built the piece that put it all together—the node, the dapps, the web3.js, the RPC endpoint, everything into one app—I had to touch everything and talk to everybody. That was quite challenging.

I also realized that Jeffrey’s team and Gavin’s team were a little disconnected, and there was still little battle and war going on where everybody wanted to determine which feature and how. I realized: guys, if we do it like this, that shit’s going nowhere. If you don’t work together, it’s too complicated, too many iterations.

So I tried to make these two teams talk. I was part of Jeffrey’s team; we were a little bit more open, at least how I felt. Gavin wanted to keep everybody under a bucket and he didn’t want that we talked to this team. But I found ways and backchannels to make them sync up. I guess Gavin didn’t like that, but it was really needed so they started to work more together.

I had to do a lot of connecting and handholding because I was in this crazy position of being hired by the Amsterdam group while sitting in the office of Gavin, the Berlin C team. I was the connector, the translator, the connector basically.

I had to deal with all the pieces: the C client had to work in the Mist browser as the Go client. So I had to talk to people when something wasn’t working. It’s crazy how much happened in the first six months before the network started.

Equally on the network side, there was so much being built and done. But the whole dapp tech stack was literally made up in this time.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I was just looking at the timeline. So September 16th, 2015 is when the first developer preview of Mist went live.

Saying about the two teams, I guess you were in the position of being the very first person building one layer up. All of the prior efforts were just about the clients and making features available on the clients, but not really building things on top—and specifically not building things on top to try and be able to work with either. So those interface issues—

SPEAKER_01: To be fair, the first dapps probably were built by Gavin and Jeffrey, but they used all the clunky half-assed stuff.

SPEAKER_00: They’re only on their own stack, right?

SPEAKER_01: Only on their own stack, yes. I built the first dapp browser: literally a generic tool that can run any JavaScript app to connect to the blockchain.

And I built it with Alex’s Ethereum Wallet, which was the first ever dapp on Ethereum: the properly designed, cross-client functional thing. Yeah, that’s exactly what we did.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. All of that prior stuff, it was just really on their own stack.

SPEAKER_01: A little JavaScript page, talking to their own endpoints.

SPEAKER_00: Yes. And looking through old videos, there was one—I think a talk in London—where both Jeff and Gav were talking about the state of Ethereum and demonstrating some things. This was October 2014, and one of the demos they had was probably one of the first on-chain DEXes.

They had GavCoin and JeffCoin—this is prior to any standards—and GavCoin was written in LLL and JeffCoin was written in Mutan. But they did do an on-chain DEX order book thing: putting a transaction for an offer, like CPU mining, picking that up. You had that interop, and I guess maybe some of the Whisper stuff was maybe kind of cross-client, but the UI layer—

SPEAKER_01: For the chat app I mainly used the Go client because the Whisper thing in the C client was not fully integrated or working.

The initial idea was that the Ethereum client will host all three things: Swarm, Whisper, and the network. Obviously Swarm never really worked in there, and neither Whisper, which later got overtaken and supported by Status, and now it’s transferred into a whole different protocol.

It’s interesting. This was really foundational times. I think what people often misunderstand is, number one, how much Ethereum was generic from day one. Number two, how many ideas were already present. If you watch the Mist browser video from Alex, we haven’t even built half of the stuff that’s in that video, and in fact a lot of those foundations are missing.

For example, now I’m working on universal profiles across smart contract systems, and that’s even in the video already. You don’t see wallets; you see profiles. You see people doing stuff. And only now, literally 10+ years later, we now have the foundation—and it’s not even widely used yet—that makes that Mist video more realistic.

Alex came up with all of these ideas. This is just what was around at the time. Even right after Bitcoin got attention in 2013, these ideas were already around: how can you build decentralized Uber, decentralized this and that, and DEX and whatever.

People think this stuff came online 2017, 2020, and that it’s somehow an invention of the Ethereum Foundation making shit up. This stuff has been around for ages.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. You had that “cryptocurrency 2.0” phase at the start there, talking about Mastercoin and things. There was a thought that everything will get built on Bitcoin. That was the initial thing.

And yes, you’ve got these altcoins and experiments and other things, and you come back together. Or even prior to Bitcoin, because Bitcoin itself was a manifestation of digital cash streams that had gone back for decades with the cypherpunks. And then you had things like BitTorrent. You did have decentralized messaging things.

SPEAKER_01: Yes. Back in the day it was all Reddit, right? Today it’s crypto Twitter. Back in the day it was Bitcoin Reddit, and Ethereum was their first real challenger to the status quo.

It split the community into the Bitcoin maximalist camp that says, “No, we only need Bitcoin. Why the heck you want any other chain?” And then the people—and even in my friend circle, friends developers, some literally never made the move. They never looked into Ethereum stack because they felt, “What do you care? Bitcoin is all you need.”

I just visited a Bitcoin meetup recently and I was so taken aback because it was like walking into a time portal 10 years back: same discussions, same problems, same people, same size of groups. You’re suddenly back in some kind of time capsule of the past where the topics they talk about are like miner this, miner that, and basic stuff that has been figured out 100 times already on Ethereum.

And very few developers, which is also impressive. How such a network that has so much attention, so much money in it, is literally just developed by 100 people, maybe not even.

SPEAKER_00: Speaking for myself, I was aware of Bitcoin for a good number of years before I had any involvement in the crypto space. There were two or three reasons I wasn’t interested.

Firstly, I was a gold bug and I was a software engineer and I know how terrible most software is. So some dude you’ve never heard of has made magic internet money? Come on.

But more importantly, it was just kind of boring to me because, okay, you can do payments. Well, there you go. That’s not very interesting. Versus: here’s a platform and you can build apps. That was like, oh, that’s kind of interesting. Maybe you had a fairly similar—

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. For me the money part was—obviously it’s cool to invest in something that’s going up. I had no money as a student; my parents are not rich or anything.

But it was so powerful: the idea that there is a technology that no one can control, that sits above the law, that sits above the influence of humans. Because you can’t break a system that’s based on consensus. It’s like a hydra with 100,000 heads. It was fascinating. I still am. Here I am building still on this stack, super pumped about the next phase of this whole technology. I just never thought it would take that long, to be honest.

SPEAKER_00: No. So you were working from the Berlin office, but presumably you were back and forth to Amsterdam sometimes? Rarely?

SPEAKER_01: The Amsterdam office, we were there maybe twice or so. The Amsterdam office was really more like a legal hub. There was Jeffrey, and the operations/personal assistant that he had. We were all over the place.

I worked with Alex mainly, who was literally three to five hours behind in Brazil, in Rio. Later we hired multiple people. We hired another person from Rio actually—two other people from Rio. At some point we were three people in the team, four people at the peak, if I remember.

But I also worked on web3.js, so I worked with Marek closely, who was in the Berlin office. I talked and worked with Christian a lot, who worked on Solidity, also in the Berlin office. And obviously Jan and the other girl that worked on Remix—left and right—was sitting across me in the Berlin office.

Christoph Jentzsch came to the Berlin office frequently. But he was more hired as a contractor to do testing scenarios for the nodes. He wrote tests to test all kinds of inputs and outputs, or node behavior. I don’t remember exactly.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Cross-client, make sure this all functions correctly.

At the same time, the Berlin office functioned as the main go-to place if you want to visit Ethereum. There were the most people there. People just showed up. Dominic Williams just showed up before he—

People that I met became friends: Gustav, who built a key manager implementation in go-ethereum. Felix, the guy who built—and still today builds—the network layer. He was also in the office in Berlin, literally lived across.

I was one of the more social developers in the group, so when somebody walked into the office, it was mostly me talking to that person because the others behaved like they didn’t know what to do. There was no secretary person or anything.

So I talked to most of the people. And also what I was working on—front end, developer stack—I was more on the layer to the outside compared to people working on the protocol. So that also reflected socially.

SPEAKER_00: Right. So you missed out on Devcon 0 because you started just after that. But you will have been to London for Devcon 1 in November of 2015 then?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I was.

SPEAKER_00: Token standards were just kind of beginning. The EIP process was just starting. So I guess that’s phase two: your first one is building a thing and touching everything, and then you’re starting to get up to that on-chain token layers. How did all that kind of grow up?

SPEAKER_01: The whole standardization for me started when Vitalik created the GitHub wiki page because he wanted to standardize tokens, ENS kind of registry, and maybe an early version of a DEX. I don’t remember. We had some discussion around the GitHub page—literally a GitHub docs page.

He made the early version of ERC-20, and we debated a little bit there mainly on Skype and some comments on this page.

Then London happened. What happened is actually funny because there was a panel about standardization. I presented a lot of things there. I presented the Mist browser. I think I presented Mist browser, maybe something else. But I was also on this panel about standardization.

Fun fact: we discussed— I watched it the other day—we discussed standards. There were two main discussions. One: should we put metadata into the contract directly? In this case the idea was: do we put the metadata of a token, like token name and symbol, into the contract, or do we create a registry for it?

In a way that’s still today the big split: do you put information into a registry like ENS, or do you put it into the user-owned contract itself, or do you make a registry for identity, or do you put the metadata in the account itself? It’s still a discussion, and it’s going to be another discussion, fun enough.

We literally discussed this. They asked: “What are you interested in in standardization?” And I said: “The account system.” I called it “proxy contract” because there was no notion of an account, but I called it a proxy contract. That was my main interest.

Funny enough, I later created ERC-725, and now the profiles are the fulfillment of that. It’s kind of funny that it was sparked there already. I talked about key management at the time.

We didn’t even propose the ERC-20. It’s kind of nice.

In this conversation, Martin Becze created the EIP repository. I think Gavin mentioned: where do we do the standardization? And I think he said in that thing, “Yeah, we have the EIP repository. That would be the right place.” And I think that inspired me: “Oh yeah, actually we could put it there.”

So that’s when I created the issue number 20. I think I coined “Ethereum Request for Comments” because of the “Request for Comments” thing. I created the issue, and I formatted this whole discussion that we had there—like a current version—in a proper specification.

I felt, number one, we need to involve the community. If you want to have consensus around the token standard, everybody needs to listen and have at least insight. Second, it needs to be in a structured way where not everybody randomly edits this file. That was actually the second comment that Gavin made. Funny enough, we all laughed about editing on that one wiki file.

So I structured the process through that. Incredible. ERC-20 as a proposal—I made a few changes, like turning around the transfer function, what’s first, value, blah blah blah, or amount, whatever. Then we had a discussion, but we didn’t really change much anymore.

We discussed there around 60 people in total, 300 comments. Pretty much after quite a while everybody kind of felt this makes sense.

The big discussion was around authorized operator or not: should we have it or not. I was kind of against it.

Fun fact: when I created the first test coin—the “Mist coin” that I used then to test in the Mist browser—the authorized operator functions, because I didn’t like it. I liked more the idea of informing recipients. But it was too early to do that because we had no idea of the side effects.

In my test coin, I didn’t add the authorized operator because I didn’t see a need.

Fun fact: later people picked up the Mist coin as a collectible meme token. Because it was a real ERC-20 but it doesn’t have the authorized operator function, it didn’t work in Uniswap. So they wrapped it. That’s why it’s now wrapped Mist coin, which wraps the real Mist coin inside a token that has the function to interact with DEXes.

But this was just a test token. It was never meant to. Over the years I gave a bunch of those to random people who asked me, until a whole group of people wanted to make this valuable. And now it’s traded; it has a market cap. It is what it is.

It’s the first ERC-20. I mean, it’s not the first first. I think there was a preliminary version that Vitalik built before that, that was not very functional or standardized. This was the first one that kind of fit the spec, except the operator stuff.

SPEAKER_00: There’s a deployment of that out which was launched, I believe, by R. Ficky, based on Vitalik’s repo there. That’s called CurrencyCoin. They call these “relic tokens,” “relic coins.”

SPEAKER_01: It’s crazy: this stuff is around. The transaction is around, the code is still around. It’s like a relic. It’s provable. Fun fact: I deployed that, I think, a week before I actually proposed the ERC-20 spec.

I felt we were more or less there. It was probably around the time of Devcon 1. We can check if it was before or after; I don’t remember. Maybe a day or two before I deployed that thing.

I think we also needed it for testing or showing something. I don’t remember. We needed to test how tokens could work or whatever.

SPEAKER_00: It may well have been for the Devcon 1 demo for your presentation.

SPEAKER_01: Maybe. Devcon did push us a lot to get some features done.

The token was not really in there because the token thing was still very out there. No one really had—everyone knew people want to make tokens, and that’s why Vitalik started this because he felt an urgency from the community. But it wasn’t in anybody’s mind that tokens need to be a primary focus.

It was just like, “Hey, I want to do it. Let’s do it.” The wallet was not really meant to immediately be super supportive of that. We played around, but it wasn’t an urgency.

That urgency really happened after the ICO wave kicked off, and then everything went completely bananas.

SPEAKER_00: And you had no idea that ERC-20 would have so much sticking power.

SPEAKER_01: No. No one could, I guess.

I knew people needed it. I knew it’s going to be a thing, because already on Mastercoin before, there was colored coins: the concept of creating other currencies on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. So there was clearly a need for it.

But I found the idea of just creating random tokens for random stuff kind of boring. For me then it’s like: okay, what is the value of this? Why would you create a token?

Honestly, if you look back and today, most tokens don’t make fucking sense. There were so many unnecessary tokens that had no purpose.

I was always a big fan of a native blockchain token because that thing makes sense. You remove it, the network doesn’t work. There’s no way you remove that token and the network is still functional and economically viable and secure.

But with all the other tokens, that was not the case.

SPEAKER_00: It’s like the simplest thing you could do. It’s like, okay, what can you do? Well, you can make new tokens. So there’s no need to make new chains and find new miners. You can float it on Ethereum.

So it’s like a simple thing, not very interesting, but it’s the first thing.

SPEAKER_01: What people don’t realize is how much more we were thinking ahead: wow, we can do really cool stuff, we can really change society with this technology. That was more interesting to people working in Ethereum than thinking how to make a token.

The whole DEX/DeFi stuff mainly came from the outside too. It was other people that saw an opportunity to make money, or “financial Lego,” whatever.

Internally, there were not a lot of people who got very excited about this, honestly, as far as I remember. Or maybe that was my perspective.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Devcon 1 also then brought more speculation. More speculation is not necessarily good, specifically in an environment in the early days where the regulatory insecurity and uncertainty was so high. The last thing we wanted is every eye on us because we’re trying to compete with banks. So I think it made us all a little uncomfortable—at least that’s how I felt, and how I think other people saw it too.

The outside world immediately jumped on it and said, “Yeah, money, money, money, money,” and that was not the point of the technology in the first place.

SPEAKER_00: No. I remember thinking at the time that’s one of the least interesting parts: the raw speculation. There’s nothing new. Versus: what are all these new things that we can build?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.

SPEAKER_00: Devcon 1 was seminal in terms of bringing together most people for the first time, with Devcon 0 being internal. Devcon 1 was the first public Ethereum conference. I sadly did not get to go. I could not afford to go.

What are your memories at that time? You must have seen so many things and so many people.

SPEAKER_01: I’ve actually been at every Devcon so far except 0, which was only 20 people in Berlin. And I was not at Devconnect in Istanbul. Apart from that, I was at every Devcon.

I was always speaking at the first few Devcons. But then the moment I was not at the Foundation anymore and doing another blockchain, then you’re like, “Oh, outcast.” It is what it is.

Even though the tech I’m building now, and the tech I’ve been building over the years, is extremely relevant to Ethereum as well. But somehow the people who picked the talks in later years, some of them literally don’t even know the history.

That’s why the work that you’re doing is really important, because you are the archivist of Ethereum. You hold up the true story and the participants and contributions and make it visible and transparent to people.

I’ve talked to so many people and they have barely any idea of how Ethereum came to be, who contributed, who did what. It’s completely unknown.

People came in in 2017 for ICOs, 2020 for DeFi, 2022 for NFTs. For them, Ethereum is just one chain. There are all the other chains and they do AMAs, and Ethereum doesn’t do AMAs. It’s all a big show, honestly.

So it’s good that you do that work. There are so many contributors that have not gotten the recognition they deserve. For example, Felix: that dude literally built and is still building the communication layer of the Ethereum network, how the nodes talk to each other. He has done that without the attention for years.

SPEAKER_00: Sorry—Felix Lang?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Felix Lang, exactly.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I spoke to him in Buenos Aires. He’s such a humble guy. He was saying, “I really don’t like Early Days of Ethereum. I don’t want the attention.” I was saying, “You’re like the longest-serving person at the EF, I think, after Vitalik.” He’s like, “That’s true. I’m just like a janitor. I just turn up and I maintain the thing. I don’t want any of that focus. It was just like a job for me.”

SPEAKER_01: Felix is crazy. I think there’s a little self-punishment: he didn’t even buy any ether at all.

I thought: what the fuck are you doing? I knew this is going to go big because it’s such a revolutionary technology. I could barely afford any, but I thought: the guy has none. He said, “If I don’t have a use for ether, if I don’t want to build an app, why would I need some?” I thought that’s kind of stupid, because you’re investing your energy and time here, you should have at least some reward.

People don’t understand: most people that worked at Ethereum didn’t care about money or investment. Neither did I. That wasn’t why we joined. We joined because it was truly—and is truly—a game-changing revolutionary technology.

So what I did is I donated some to him, and I made everybody in the team donate some to him. So at least he got like, I don’t know, 100 ether or whatever. I don’t know if he kept it. I guess he did.

And I even made Jeffrey give some, and Jeffrey gave almost the same amount like us. We had barely any, but Jeffrey has a fuckload. It was so weird. Like, dude, Jeffrey, you can give a little more. I found it a little schnauzer. I literally forced him to, basically.

SPEAKER_00: I think a lot of newer people don’t comprehend how little money was a motivation at all for many of the people. It was really about: what can you build and what can happen? There was no certainty it was even going to work, launch, or have success. It was: maybe this thing can happen. Let’s try.

But this money was—

SPEAKER_01: Never the intention of anyone that I knew. Obviously some of us felt this can be big, but we had no idea. At the same time, there was Bitcoin rising, and Bitcoin had more traction and was more of a safe bet. Ethereum was a complete gamble.

When I donated this ether—people say, “He gave him 100 ether.” When that hit $10, we all thought we made it to the universe. It cost literally 40, 50, 60 cents.

We had 10, 20 ether on some wallets laying around just for building stuff. I hope I could find some of those again. But all these keys were ephemeral, in some codebase maybe, or maybe not. Nobody cared, honestly.

Not the people who worked internally. But from the outside, they all thought we did it to make this thing big and get rich. The perception from the outside is sometimes really distorted.

SPEAKER_00: Talking to the ICO and that monetary speculation: I remember almost being repulsed at that speculative thing, and the projection of that mindset onto the people that were actually building. “Oh, you guys are just doing this to get rich. You’re just giving yourselves the money. Who needs smart contracts? It’s all a scam.”

Also the assumption: “Oh, you’re all massively rich.”

Felix not having any ETH—that was me as well. The reason why is because I didn’t have any money. I was impoverishing myself being involved. I was volunteering for a long time with nothing. Then even when I got hired at the Foundation, I was getting paid 60k a year, which is like half of what my prior salary had been. It was not—

SPEAKER_01: Same for me. My salary at the Foundation was 60k. Only towards the end, when we had a little bit of success, I negotiated it up to 90k, before tax.

Same with the ether: everybody thinks if you got ether back then, you must be insanely rich. It’s like, dude: when that hit $10, we thought we made it. You cash out a few hundred thousand and you think you’ll be super rich.

Same with some of the early people who had a lot more ether: they cashed out 100,000 ether for, I don’t know, a dollar, because they thought this is really high.

Barely anybody held it until it hit a few hundred and thousand dollars. People don’t understand: it was 10 years, and there were 5+ years with many ups and downs and bubbles.

I have no ether anymore since many years. I spent them all. My ex-wife had ideas what she wanted to do, bought a house that now belongs to her parents, and stuff. I’m working on LUKSO and a lot of my money went into supporting that.

So the idea that if I would have held everything, sure, that would be a lot. But that means not spending money for all those years and only living with salary. And second, you’d have to trust so much that this is going to be worth a lot. It’s impossible. Barely anyone.

SPEAKER_00: It’s this impossible fantasy: assuming you’re going to say, “Okay, it’s 100x—no, no, it’s 1000x.” Keep going. “I know 10,000% is possible.”

So going back to Devcon 1: I was looking at some of the videos recently, and pretty much any idea you can imagine seemed to be presented there. Did you see most of the presentations?

SPEAKER_01: This is the thing: most people don’t understand this stuff people talk about right now is not being made up now. That stuff has been made up before, tried before.

For example: Base launched the “degen” thing and now cut it off again, right? You have a post and people bet on it. Steam did that four years ago, and at least they did it smart because it wasn’t a Reddit style feature.

Reddit posts stay longer; they have more value over time. Posts that literally disappear after scrolling a page aren’t worth betting on. That’s fucking scamming people.

None of this stuff we see is new.

What’s fascinating to me is that the crypto space today is still built more or less on the same foundations. If you go to the bottom, it’s the same foundations we made up in the first six months and first year of Ethereum: same provider. Now there’s a different way how it’s injected, but it’s still a provider.

Same provider, how your dapp connects to the node. Same RPC endpoints, pretty much. Not too much added here either. EOAs have been the default since back then.

Fun fact: Jeffrey told me, “You guys should not expose the public key, the EOA, to the user. You should use a smart contract account.” That stuck with me. He was right. But it was so early. We barely figured out how to make any transaction work. Routing this through a smart contract felt absurd. But he was right.

Now, in all these years, that’s what I built. The foundation we discussed back in the day and wanted back in the day. But it took all this learning. It also took me stepping outside of the Ethereum ecosystem, creating a different standards track, in order to do that.

When you try to do radical changes in an existing ecosystem with existing standards debates, it’s so slow. You need to be backwards compatible. You need to move the current wagon along. If you want to make radical changes, you have so many people intervening, moving it around, and it goes nowhere.

So I needed to do it in a different approach. Funny enough, I coined the ERC “Request for Comments” standard space, then went off and created the LUKSO Standards Proposals and did it there—even though it adjusts Ethereum standards too—so I could do it right.

It’s going to show. Mark my words. This will blow people’s minds when they see it.

SPEAKER_00: So you were at the EF working on Mist through to 2017.

SPEAKER_01: No—August 2018. 2018.

SPEAKER_00: So what further work happened between that very first release and the sunsetting? What was that?

SPEAKER_01: My work was not only Mist. I worked for three and a half years at Ethereum, and in the later years I started working more on the developer tools.

I overtook web3.js, which was the main JavaScript library at the time. When Marek left with Gavin to join Parity (Ethcore), I overtook web3.js, so I mainly maintained this library. I built the web3.js 2.0 version of it. That was the last thing I did before I left, releasing the 2.0 version of that library.

In the last year I stepped a little out of the Mist team. I was focused on other things more. I was still kind of the main developer in Mist, but now there was more maintenance.

Mist was complicated because we were always lagging behind Chromium and Electron. Electron uses Chromium. So if there was a bug in Chromium, it needed to first be supported by Electron before we could support it. There was a cycle.

We worked a lot on the interface: the Ethereum Wallet—people called it the Mist wallet—was basically the main thing ever really used. People never really used it fully as a Web3 browser, but we built all kinds of features in there. I built things in there that an app could set notifications on the sidebar. There were a lot of features that were never fully used.

The biggest problem for Mist, and in a way the death of Mist, was the slow syncing of the Ethereum nodes.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Because we wanted to do it the full decentralized way, we didn’t want to talk to a backend node that someone hosted. The Ethereum Foundation probably wouldn’t have paid for a node hosted on a server for everyone else to connect to.

SPEAKER_00: I completely believe there’s so much penny-pinching on costs.

SPEAKER_01: It would have been so easy: instead of talking to the localhost node, talk to a remote node. I could have added a feature in no time.

But we didn’t do it because it went against the whole idea of doing it decentralized.

The only problem is that after six, seven, eight months, syncing Mist—if you didn’t have it open for a week—took sometimes half an hour.

Then MetaMask came up with the idea: build a browser extension, connect into a remote node, inject it into an existing browser. That idea won. MetaMask outcompeted Mist.

On top of this, keeping it secure is what made us shut it down. We had a lot more ideas. Look at the video: we hadn’t even started playing out the idea of Mist fully. But at the time it was not the right time.

It showed a lot of people how things can be done, why to do it this way, how to build apps. It set the stage.

SPEAKER_00: In terms of local node and full decentralization: I remember thinking, yeah, of course that’s going to happen. Everyone’s going to have an Ethereum node running on every device. You’ll have one running in the background on your phone. They’ll be in every router, media station, computer.

SPEAKER_01: Also there was the idea of light clients, and we knew light clients were coming, and we really bet on the fact that light clients will solve the problem.

The only problem is the light client never really came, or it came but it was not cross-client and it didn’t fully work.

We hoped a lot on the light client. This is why we kept doing it this way: once we have a light client, things will be—

SPEAKER_00: Like this. We’ll build on the full node for now, and then the light client will come in.

SPEAKER_01: I think we actually came that far. There were versions of Mist that had geth built in with light client support that synced very fast. But by that time people already moved on to MetaMask.

Again, security and other reasons made us give up. But I already moved on to web3.js at the time, because that was a tool everybody was using. 70 million, 140 million downloads, or God knows what it has now. It’s still used a lot, even though now ethers and others took over.

When I left, at some point Alex shut it down. It had its purpose.

By the way, the idea of the Mist browser is still a valid idea. What I’m building now is like Mist browser mobile. It’s almost full circle.

I introduced a smart contract account, the same like Jeffrey said we should do it. That’s the foundation of your access to Web3. Then you have a web browser in an app that allows you to interact with dapps easily while doing it in a human-focused way. Not wallet-focused, but profile-focused. Safe. Easy gas. Works for humans.

That was also the idea of Mist: not meant for nerds and techies. Meant to be normal people interacting with this new technology.

That’s going to come now with the universal profile app as kind of a Mist browser on mobile in its first version.

SPEAKER_00: The goal being not just to replicate existing applications on the blockchain, but to enable things that weren’t possible before. Having this hub integrating different pieces of your life. That was real utility.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly.

What’s interesting—and surprising—is we are 10+ years into Ethereum, and there are so many networks, EVM apps. Most are very financial focused, which turned me off. The moment DeFi happened, I thought: that’s a big gamble park. Important protocols, but it became a casino.

But what’s interesting is: we go to conferences, any place in the world, you meet Web3 people, and no one is using Web3 apps.

People have wallets. Maybe they’re purchasing a coin here and there. But interacting with actual apps—voting, joining a community, reputation, all the things you could do on-chain—it doesn’t happen.

Honestly, if somebody would have told me in 2015 or 2016 or 2017 that in 10 years there’s still no actual users using the apps, I would have thought: number one, if that happens it’s a total fail. Number two, there’s no way. And here we are. It’s crazy.

SPEAKER_00: I remember in 2018 I went to the Consensus conference, like New York Blockchain Week. There was a panel, almost like Bitcoin versus Ethereum. You had Jimmy Song with his cowboy hat, and you had Joe Lubin.

Jimmy was basically saying, “Dapps are useless. Smart contracts are useless. Nobody’s going to be using these in five years.” And Jimmy and Joe were having a bet for a pretty significant amount of bitcoin. I can’t remember what it ended up being.

There was this crypto Twitter ongoing discussion: is this—

SPEAKER_01: Luckily he didn’t propose to cut off his penis.

SPEAKER_00: Not McAfee.

But yeah, it’s disappointing. DeFi is working. Stablecoins are being used.

SPEAKER_01: The whole financial Lego works, yes, but only with the people that went through the hoops. Now you have Robinhood and other apps that integrate and make it easier. So the trading part works: people buying, selling.

But normal users using Web3 infrastructure in their daily lives: nonexistent. Nonexistent. I know why. I spent the last seven years thinking about that and how to solve that. That’s what I’m working on now.

SPEAKER_00: So how did you come to leave the EF, and what was that journey like? And then what have you been doing? Tell me about all your work at LUKSO.

SPEAKER_01: Before we do this, I need to go pee. So you need to look at the timestamp, and then—this is too much tea.

SPEAKER_00: That makes sense.

SPEAKER_01: Sorry for the interruption.

SPEAKER_00: No worries. So yeah, I’ll cut it and I’ll just ask again. Could you tell me about how you came to leave the EF and what your motivation was, and what did you do, and what have you been doing?

SPEAKER_01: I was, in a way, in a good place. I worked on web3.js. Developers loved me because I built their foundational piece. Mist was kind of fading out, but was cool too. I was in a good place.

But what happened is: my ex-wife at the time had this idea: “Let’s do something fashion, lifestyle on the blockchain.” And I thought, that sounds super boring. Also I knew there were so many people already trying to do something like this.

But then I thought about it: we can use lifestyle and fashion—if you get big players in and mainstream normal users through these brands—we can get mainstream people into using this technology. That could be the Trojan horse to make this technology attractive and interesting to people outside trading. So I thought actually this is kind of genius.

It also sounded like a lunatic, crazy idea and completely out of my league. Initially I thought: okay, I can support Marjorie a little bit. She does the project. I can help with advice. At the same time, I worked three and a half years at Ethereum. I did all the foundation work I needed to do. I felt: okay, I did everything I can do here. I can stay for another 10 years, but I don’t think I’m gaining a lot more from this point on.

In hindsight, I’m right. If I look at others still there, the world didn’t change for them. They’re working on the same thing.

Then at some point, when we started ideating the project and mapping it out, Marjorie kind of forced me: either you’re all in or you’re out.

She was a tough person. That’s her character. But in a way, she forced me to decide: do I want to stay at Ethereum comfortable for indefinite, or go all in, crazy risk, something new?

I knew my colleagues would think, “What the fuck? His girlfriend twisted his head. Now he’s doing some centralized fashion shit,” blah blah. But I knew this is a path for real adoption.

My idea was different than Marjorie’s. I wanted to create an infrastructure, then use her fashion connections as a tool to get users into the technology.

At the same time I came up with a standard called ERC-725. Before LUKSO, it’s 725, which is one standard before 721, even though there are three other issue numbers after, but there was nothing in the middle. It was a proper standard after.

It was a coincidence how I came up with 725. I was at the BCG workshop. They wanted to make identity on the blockchain. I was the only one really coming up with something concrete.

After this workshop series, I made this smart contract account system. I called it proxy account, same like we called it in 2015 at the panel, funny enough. I had this urge to propose this as a standard. I had no idea why. I didn’t want to, because I was fine with what I was doing. I didn’t need attention.

But the moment I put it out there, suddenly the whole Ethereum space—or a lot of developers—were like, “Oh my God, this is the Ethereum identity standard.” Projects came. I created the ERC-725 Alliance (Origin Protocol, and others).

And uPort got super pissed because uPort—which was a ConsenSys identity protocol at the time—thought, “What the fuck? We’re working on Ethereum identity for the last year, and now Fabian comes and makes a standard and everybody pays attention.”

They wrote a big blog post how mine is this massive monster and there’s this modular system. I didn’t want the fight or the attention. I knew it was an early draft and needed a lot more work. But people treated it like it’s the final thing: “Identity is now here.” And I was like, guys.

Then when we started LUKSO—few months after—I realized: if I want to make a chain that’s for normies, for culture creators, anything outside finance, identity is the most important piece. If people can’t use an on-chain account properly—UX needs to be easy—and ideally unlosable, there’s no way you can put these people on-chain. They’re not going to run around with wallets with private keys they need to remember.

So I knew I had to build out a full standard. That was annoying because I didn’t want to do it. In hindsight it was a psychotic idea because it took me four years to build out the foundational standards. And now it’s almost eight years to put it to a state where it’s literally usable by people—currently only on LUKSO—but it’s going to come to all other chains, including Ethereum, very soon. Now it’s being used by AI. Fun fact: I knew it would be possible, but I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.

So this is now a frenzy that started two weeks ago.

The LUKSO story is its own episode. But long story short: I built this account system, evolved token standards in a quieter space, because I made the LUKSO Standards Proposals so I could do it properly, evolving accounts and tokens together—not thinking about one standard isolated, but how it works together in a Lego-like way.

When this comes cross-chain, specifically universal profiles, it’s going to show for the broader ecosystem. For sure.

Token standards: once the train ran—once people went with ERC-20—the adoption happened. There’s no way you convince people to migrate a token. It doesn’t happen. That’s exactly where a new network makes sense: on a new network you can do it all the new ways. You can discover more possibilities, cooler protocols, more automation—things you couldn’t do on ERC-20 at all.

Hence why a new chain makes sense also for gas subsidization, for smart contract accounts, which need to be subsidized if you don’t want to pay right away.

All of this is hard on an existing network. The rest of the EVM system shows you a 2015 standard with no prior evolution. We made it up with whatever we knew, which was literally nothing. It still came far. But yeah.

Universal profiles will play a role. I think they will be the biggest enabler for Web3. I believe this will be bigger than ERC-20. It’s going to blow people’s minds when they understand and see it.

I know people have been watching me talk about this for years, putting it aside: okay, it’s isolated LUKSO world. Who cares? It’s going to show.

And right now what’s funny is we’re in the time of AI and OpenClaw—the AI tool that’s an open-source harness for AI to run. I know you’re playing around with one. I have my own, Emmett, as well.

If you want to have an AI interacting on-chain, you better need a smart contract. If you give it a private key—like “wokey” from Gitcoin did the other day—he gave it a private key, there was money on it, and somebody figured out how to trigger the AI to return the private key and stole the money.

SPEAKER_00: I didn’t spot that. That’s interesting.

SPEAKER_01: You should check it out.

With a universal profile it’s very different because you have your smart contract account. You can delegate access to a single controller key or many controller keys. You tell your AI: create yourself a controller key, give me the public key. I authorize you to control the profile, but I will limit you to certain things.

You could limit it to only talk to certain smart contracts, call certain functions, only update profile data, make sure it cannot change controller keys or add new ones. You can constrict it down. Now it can go wild, maybe even lose its private key along the way. But its identity, its account, and all the stuff on it—as long as the key wasn’t leaked and could move—everything doesn’t go away.

So I have bought a few people’s now spun-up bots. Now it’s very easy: on OpenClaw you can install the universal profile skill. You go to the website, create a profile, authorize it. Then it already has free gas on LUKSO because we subsidize this. It can do stuff on LUKSO by itself.

Now the AIs on Twitter are figuring this out. They’re shilling universal profiles because they can quickly research what systems exist and compare. They collectively decide to use universal profiles. It’s fantastic because they realize it’s the best tech for what they need. The AI is making the choice now. It’s funny to watch. And that’s very recent—last two weeks.

SPEAKER_00: That’s great. I found myself thinking over the last few weeks that maybe the end users that are going to have the most benefit from these technologies are going to be agents, at least partially. Because some of the UX stuff never got there. People not using dapps.

Maybe they never do, but they use agents that do, and this becomes the piping that allows the kind of experience on top that we’ve always wanted.

SPEAKER_01: I would say it’s both.

AI needs an on-chain account and profiles work well for that, on any network. But it became really apparent to me what the main problem is: why no one is using apps at conferences.

If you want to recommend your friend: “Hey, there’s this cool dapp. Join that community, vote, claim this token, let me send you stablecoin.” What’s the thing you’re missing in the equation?

SPEAKER_00: How you get there, and that onboarding. With gas: needing the native token on all the chains you touch. You can end up stuck: you’ve got the tokens, but you haven’t got the gas.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly. If you walk through this process once—go to exchange or on-ramp, buy the thing, move it to your wallet—and if you have a smart contract account, move it to the controller key. Most wallets don’t expose controller keys properly. It’s confusing. And then you have to do that for every network.

A person
