SPEAKER_00: So hello and welcome to Early Days of Ethereum. I am delighted today to be joined by Fabian Vogelsteller. Is that the correct pronunciation? Vogelsteller. More like an F. The V is more like an F. Yes, right. Very Germanic pronunciation that's not going to come out of my mouth. So, you know, great to see you. We saw each other at DevConnect. In November, I think, for the first time for quite a while. And had a good catch up there. But hello. Hey. Yeah. What were you doing prior to wandering into blockchain world?

SPEAKER_02: So, okay, let's start from the beginning. Okay. So what I was doing before blockchain, I was actually a web developer. So I started out as, I mean, I've built websites since I was 14. My Findura, the name that I have on Twitter, is actually the name of the content management system that I built, I think, in 2005. And it just happened to be, you know, turning into my second identity. So I have two identities in the internet, Frozman and Findura. It's all just connected to two things. In GitHub, I'm Frozman. And that's also my GitHub history with Ethereum and so on. And Findura is then my online one. And, yeah, I mean, I basically, you know, was always interested in the cutting the edge of, like, the cool internet stuff in the 90s. You know, building in the first 2000s my first websites or 1990, whatever, eight, nine. And, you know, following the whole evolution of the internet with HTML, CSS, HTML1 and 2 and CSS1 and 2 and JavaScript and coming in and blah, blah, blah. So I mainly did web development. But I studied media design. So I didn't study anything with coding. All the coding is autodidactically learned. So I haven't, yeah, there's nothing that came from, honestly, even when I joined Ethereum, I had no fucking clue about bytes and how to manipulate bytes and stuff. Still don't have, actually. So I still don't know.

SPEAKER_00: You didn't have your computer science background. I don't have any computer science background.

SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure what I'm, I don't know what I'm doing on the computer. I just know how to interact with, like, high-level languages. And now I only know how to speak to AI and to my team. Well, that's all you need. Things changed. And you wrote a book? I wrote a book about Meteor.js. So I, yeah, I got really, obviously, into web development. I did a lot of websites and built a lot of things. I built my own content management system in PHP. And I built a flat file-based content management system. So that means that this doesn't need a database. The whole idea was, okay, I just want to have one of these FTP, PHP-ready servers. And if I want to move my, it was literally all about the independence of hosting providers, right? If I want to move from this hosting provider to the other, I mean, back in the day, migrating databases was a nightmare and probably still is a nightmare. It was, oh, if I build a flat file-based thing, you just copy the whole folder structure over to the other server and it works. And it did. So that was what DefineDura.org CMS does and did. I mean, obviously, who uses a PHP today? But Facebook does. No, but I mean, yeah, now I have a bunch of haters in the PHP community. But, yeah, I mean, so, yeah, I built that thing and that was really, like, helping me, like, to kind of, like, do a full project front to end. And then I got more into JavaScript and I got really excited by MeteorJazz, which was one of the first reactive JavaScript frameworks that was before Angular, before React. And it was the first time where you just could write, like, this JavaScript code and this HTML stuff. And when you update stuff in the JavaScript or in your local state, like the HTML got re-rendered natively, super magic. So I got really into this and I wrote a book about it. I have it here. If you ever want to, I would never, I would never read a tutorial book, to be honest. But I wrote one.

SPEAKER_00: I don't think people even read books anymore.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I mean, honestly, I would never even, it was so much fucking work to do this. And the reason why I did this is because they reached out to me and I thought, like, yeah, I could do that. And then, you know, Marjorie, my ex-wife, back in the day, encouraged me and I thought, like, okay, why not? And on the end, it was a lot of work. I mean, literally, like, four months of waking up and I had a kid, two-year-old, two-year-old kid at a time. And I had to wake up very early or maybe a year old, I don't remember. And I had to wake up very early at five to, you know, write one or two, three pages or five pages, whatever, and then go to work. It was intense. You get an hourly rate of, like, 10 cents. So, I made totally no money. I literally probably made, like, exactly, like, 10 cents per hour or something like this. Right. But it's reputation. And in a way, I think that's also what got me into Ethereum. Right. Because what is this? Writing single-page apps with Meteor. And what is a D-app? It's a single-page app. It's the whole point. It's an app that literally runs in your browser, doesn't require a back-end. And I built, actually, a tool that allowed you to strip out the server part of the Meteor app so you can bundle it as a local app. It's actually quite – it was quite a popular repository called Meteor Build Client. And, yeah, that's what I used for D-apps in the early days in Ethereum, too.

SPEAKER_00: So, is Meteor still an active project? Is anyone using Meteor still?

**[06:52] SPEAKER_UNKNOWN:** Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: No, I totally think so. I think so.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: I mean, I don't know how frequent they are. Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: I haven't checked it out in a long time. No. But, I mean, it's quite a revolution at the time, the single-page app.

SPEAKER_02: It was the first, you know. It was literally, like – it was one of the first – it was the first framework that I know that really was a proper framework. And it's just solved the whole thing from account creation to reactive DOM updates to server client synchronization. It was magic. Yeah. It blew a lot of people away. And then all the others, React and so on, were kind of more like answers to this. And then React brought it back to the weird way of mixing code and UI in the same files, which I already found very bad in PHP times.

SPEAKER_00: Right. Yeah. And then I guess you maybe sort of found your way into Bitcoin world in some form?

SPEAKER_02: So, yeah, 2013, I heard about Canadian wants to sell a house in Bitcoin. And I thought, okay, wow. What's that? Like somebody's selling a house in a currency I've never heard of. And that really led me very quickly down the rabbit hole of – this was 2013 March. There was literally when Bitcoin hit $200 in that very same month. And number one, I saw, okay, there's money to be made here. And I was a student with no money. So, like, you know, trying – like, you have your hope. Okay, maybe I can make a little bit of money on the side this way. But I really quickly understood the fundamental power of this technology. And it took me, like, about a year to really understand how it works fully. I mean, I literally had this epiphany every month that I thought, like, now I know how it works. It took me a year to really construe my brain, you know, knowing servers and frameworks, you know, and how this basic stuff works. And then the crypto, blockchains that were just so out there in a way how this stuff works. But, yeah, so I was in the space. And then in 2000, obviously, you know, right after I joined the Bitcoin community, then there was the first altcoin, Litecoin. And then in 2013, there was a lot of, like, projects that were created trying to imitate Bitcoin or do an improvement or do alternate versions. I also got really into Mastercoin, the idea of just writing onto the Bitcoin blockchain rather than creating a separate blockchain. Right.

SPEAKER_00: And you were in Berlin, right? Were you going to meetups or, like, did you find fellows? It was online.

SPEAKER_02: There were no meetups at the time, really, like, not in my region. So what actually happened in 2000, and so they were done later, 2014, there were then some meetups. And so I heard about Ethereum. I really knew that I just felt immediately that this is a really powerful approach, but it also sounded so unrealistic. So when I heard, like, this, I mean, I looked at the white paper. I never really read the Ethereum white paper actually ever fully. I just literally just, like, I skipped over it. And I listened to Vitalik or, like, the early things that were floating around, and I knew this is it. The idea of making a computation machine on the blockchain makes total sense. I just thought it's so hard to do. And I didn't really give it a lot of chances that they pulled this off, but then they pulled it off pretty quickly. And it just happened so that I was at a meetup in Berlin, a Bitcoin meetup. I think the first one I was ever at. Right. They wanted to open a Bitcoin center Berlin co-working space, basically. Can you imagine what kind of month that might have been? I think that was in, I think it was August 2024. It was literally, like, a week before the Ethereum pre-sale started. Right, right. Like, literally, like, days before. So I met these guys from Ethereum. In this case, it was Aaron, who did the accounting at the time. Yeah. And they told me that they're going to open an office in Berlin, and that there's some kind of news coming out next week, but they can't tell me. And I was already following Ethereum. I was already waiting for the ICO. And, yeah, then it happened. So I took all my Bitcoin that I had at the time, which was 12 Bitcoins, converted them into Ether. I mean, people think, like, oh, my God, 12 Bitcoins, but they were, like, $600 worth or whatever. It was, like, literally not much. I put them all into Ether or pretty much everything. And I knew this was going to be big. I felt it. And this was also the first time a project where I thought I would love to work for this project because it's not about finance, money, and wallets. Because every Bitcoin startup at the time was just about creating a wallet. And I was really interested in creating wallets. And so it just happened that the same, like, six months later, you know, Bitcoin happened, ICO happened, attention came, blah, blah, blah. But I just got an email from a recruiter saying the company Ethereum is looking for a C++ developer. And I was not a C++ developer. Recruiters don't check anything on LinkedIn, I guess, or GitHub. But I knew that they're now looking. So I went to their office and I just chatted with Aaron again. And I saw they had this office here, Waldemar Straße. And I realized that, okay, like, actually, they're really just thinking that they're going to build the nodes. And then, like, people will build on top of the stack. And I just knew, you know, like, I know how to build Singularge apps. This is what you need. I knew this is what they will need to make sure, to show what a DApp can be and show how to, I just felt it. And so I said, like, Aaron, just can, I mean, I showed him this as well and just ask around internally. And they had one Skype group that was kind of like the Discord group at the time, yeah. And funny enough, Alex van der Sander is the one who, like, came on on board as the UX designer also just a month before me. And he had this whole idea of, like, creating this missed browser concept. And I think when Alex heard about that there's this guy, you know, that came up here that can build, you know, single-page apps, blah, blah, blah. Then Alex thought, oh, that could be the person who can help with building the missed browser. So you convinced Jeff, I mean, that's my assumption, what happened. And he tried to call me up. And I was in Turkey on holidays, so I didn't pick up the phone. And then when I came back, I saw someone who called me up. And somehow, I think I called him back or whatever. And, yeah, he said, hey, you want to work here? We want to, like, want to do this and this and la, la, la, la, la. And this was Aaron that you were talking to again? No, this was Alex. Yeah. So I was talking to Afsa. So Afsa wanted to have me because he, I think he probably convinced Jeff because he saw this as a guy who can help build his idea, right? And Jeffrey was kind of skeptical of hiring anyone. This is not a code developer. What the fuck can you do, I guess? That's what he thought.

**[14:54] SPEAKER_UNKNOWN:** Probably.

SPEAKER_02: What? JavaScript?

SPEAKER_00: Cannot work. So, I mean, you started in, I think it was January 2015. So I guess this discussion would have been in, like, December 2014-ish.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was December, exactly. Yeah, yeah. It was mid of December. I was on holidays. He tried to call me. And he said, hey, can you start? And I asked, you know, when to start. And he said, yeah, start in January. And Jeffrey obviously really wanted to prove me. So he thought, okay, let me just throw a really complicated task at him. And then we fail
