**Analysis of the Request:**

1.  **Role:** Expert transcript editor specializing in Ethereum and blockchain technology.
2.  **Context:** Provided lists of "Known People" (244) and "Technical Terms" (163) to ensure correct spelling and capitalization.
3.  **Input:** A raw transcript from speech recognition, including speaker labels and timestamps.
4.  **Objective:** Create a clean, readable transcript preserving ALL dialogue and content.
5.  **Critical Rules:**
    *   NO preamble, introduction, or meta-commentary.
    *   START IMMEDIATELY with the first speaker label.
    *   Output ONLY the formatted transcript.
    *   **Content Preservation:** Do NOT summarize or skip dialogue. Maintain approximately the same length (90-110% of input).
    *   **Timestamps:** PRESERVE exact input timestamps (one per speaker paragraph). Do not recalculate.
    *   **Format:** Merge consecutive speech from one speaker into paragraphs. Bold speaker label with timestamp. Separate paragraphs from the same speaker with blank lines but no speaker prefix. Separate speakers with blank lines.
6.  **What to Fix:** Technical terms (Ethereum, Bitcoin, DAO, etc.), Proper Names (use the "Key People" list - e.g., Kieran -> Kieren), Punctuation/Sentence structure.
7.  **What to Remove:** Excessive filler words (um, uh, like), false starts, obvious repetitions.
8.  **What to Preserve:** All substantive dialogue, technical explanations, speaker labels, timestamps, natural flow.

**Step-by-Step Processing Plan:**

1.  **Analyze the Input:**
    *   Length: ~3,200 words.
    *   Speakers: SPEAKER_00 (Bob - inferred from context), SPEAKER_01 (Kieren/Unknown?), SPEAKER_02 (Bob), SPEAKER_03 (Kieren - inferred), SPEAKER_04 (Taylor), UNKNOWN.
    *   Content: Early Ethereum history, Taylor's background, Miami conference, Zug (Switzerland) house, The Red Wedding, DEVCON 1.

2.  **Review Key People List (Mental Check):**
    *   Bob: Bob Summerwill (List says "Bob Summerwill").
    *   Taylor: Taylor Garrick (Not in list explicitly, but context confirms "Taylor Garrick").
    *   Kieren: Kieren James-Lubin (List says "Kieren James-Lubin", transcript says "Kieran". Must change to Kieren).
    *   Mihai: Mihai Alisie (List says "Mihai Alisie").
    *   Vitalik: Vitalik Buterin (List says "Vitalik Buterin").
    *   Charles: Charles Hoskinson (List says "Charles Hoskinson").

    *   Gavin: Gavin Wood (List says "Gavin Wood").
    *   Gav: Gavin Wood.
    *   Ian: Ian Meikle (List says "Ian Meikle" or similar? Checking list... I don't see Ian Meikle in the provided list. I will stick to the transcript spelling "Ian Meikle" or "Ian Meiklejohn"? Transcript says "Ian Meikle". Wait, looking at list again... "Ian Meikle" is NOT in the provided list. I will leave it as is or standard capitalization).
    *   Richard: Richard Wilde (Not in list, but transcript mentions).
    *   Nick Szabo: (Not in list, transcript says "nick sabo").
    *   Mariusz: (Transcript says "Mariusz?", maybe Marusi?).
    *   Stephen Nareoff: (Not in list).
    *   Jonathan Mohan: (Not in list).
    *   Ming: Ming Chan (Not in list).
    *   Wendell: Wendell Davis (Not in list).

3.  **Review Technical Terms List (Mental Check):**
    *   Ethereum, Bitcoin, blockchain, DAO, client, consensus, decentralized, DeFi, etc.

4.  **Detailed Editing (Section by Section):**

    *   **[02:14] SPEAKER_02:** "That little love. Fantastic." -> Keep as is.
    *   **[02:20] SPEAKER_03:** "All here. Hello. Hello. We are back." -> Keep.
    *   **[02:27] SPEAKER_00:** "Great. Yeah. Uh, you know, technical difficulties, uh, I suppose it's common..." -> Clean up filler. "Great. Yeah. You know, technical difficulties, I suppose it's common. I think we wanted to start at five oh five. And, uh, so we are doing well on time..." -> "Great. Yeah. You know, technical difficulties, I suppose it's common. I think we wanted to start at five oh five. And so we are doing well on time. Thanks for everyone for jumping over. Just a friendly reminder, just throw any questions within the Twitter thread. I'll be keeping an eye on those. Hey, Mike. Thanks, Yum, for posting both two great comments in the thread. And then, yeah, like, share, repost. Got a great space ahead. And then with that, I guess we can get started, and I'll pass it over to Bob to introduce the speakers."
    *   **[03:14] SPEAKER_01:** "So, hi." -> Keep.
    *   **[03:16] SPEAKER_02:** "Welcome, everyone. So, yeah, really happy to have Taylor Garrick here as a guest..." -> Keep names correct. "Kieran Victor" -> Kieren James-Lubin (Context suggests "Kieren", transcript says "Kieran Victor". I need to check the list. List has "Kieren James-Lubin". Transcript says "Kieran Victor". I will correct "Kieran" to "Kieren" based on the rule "Kieran -> Kieren". Victor might be a misinterpretation of a last name, but I'll stick to what's clear. Actually, the prompt says "Kieran -> Kieren". I will fix the spelling).
    *   **[04:26] SPEAKER_04:** Taylor's intro. "Hello, everybody. And thank you very much for that kind introduction, Bob..."
    *   **[04:46] SPEAKER_02:** "So, Taylor, do tell us something about yourself in general..."
    *   **[05:02] SPEAKER_04:** Taylor's background. "I'm actually sitting in the town I was born in, in South Florida..." "management of information systems..." "proprietary software... Microsoft..." "open source... PHP MySQL..." "Bitcoin... decentralized... cryptocurrency..."

Let's assume 'embedded' or just quote the unclear audio if necessary, but 'embedded' makes sense in context (F-Embedded?). Actually, "f embedded" might be "EF embedded" (Ethereum Foundation Embedded) or just a slur. I'll listen to the text. "contributor to f embedded". Maybe "f-embedded"? Let's just clean it to "embedded" if it's nonsense, but looking at context, maybe "EF"? "I was on the screen as a named uh contributor to f embedded". I will transcribe as "embedded" or "EF embedded" to be safe? Let's stick to the transcript "embedded" but clean the stutter. Actually, looking at Ethereum history, maybe "F-Eth-embedded"? No. Let's just smooth it out. "I was on the screen as a named contributor to embedded."
    *   **[15:08] SPEAKER_04:** "lot of people have uh... families... green pastures... life isn't just working about working on startups..." "natural cycle..."

Transcript says 'Meyer's couple'. Might be a mishearing of a specific place. I'll keep 'Meyer's couple' if it's specific, or correct if obvious. Actually, looking at maps, 'Meilen' is near Zurich. Or maybe 'Männedorf'? Let's just keep 'Meyer's couple' as a proper noun phrase if it's not clear, or smooth to 'Meilen' if I'm sure. But I'm not. I'll stick to the text but clean it up). Let's assume it's a typo for a place name. "Meyer's couple" -> Maybe "Meyer's Cup"? No. Let's just leave it as "Meyer's couple" but it sounds weird. Maybe "myself, Nick... couple"?

**Refining Corrections and Standardizations:**
*   "Kieran" -> "Kieren" (Check list: "Kieren James-Lubin").
*   "Zoog" -> "Zug" (Correct name).
*   "Meyer's couple" -> "Meilen" (Best guess for town near Zurich, but I will stick to the transcript if unsure. "Meyer's couple" sounds like "Meyers Koppel"? Maybe a specific Airbnb name? I'll leave as "Meyer's couple" to be safe, or fix to "Meilen" if confident. Given the context "farm town called", "Meilen" is a town on Lake Zurich. "Meyer's couple" might be a mishearing of "Männedorf"? Or maybe "Myer's couple"? Let's stick to the text but capitalize "Meyer's Couple" if it's a name, or leave "Meyer's couple" as a descriptor. Actually, looking at the transcript: "train to a small farm town called meyer's couple". It's definitely a mishearing. "Meilen" fits phonetically better than "Meyer's couple". However, "Meyrin" is in Geneva. "Morges"? "Muri"? Let's try to keep the flow. I will write "Meilen" with a mental note that it's a correction, or just "Meyer's Couple" if I want to be 100% faithful to the audio text even if wrong. The prompt says "Technical term spellings... Proper names". "Meilen" is a proper name. "Meyer's couple" is likely wrong. I'll change to "Meilen" as it's a known town near Zurich. Wait, "Meyer's couple" might be "Myers Corner"? No. I'll stick to the transcript "Meyer's couple" to avoid guessing wrong on a proper noun not in the list, but capitalize it "Meyer's Couple" as it seems to be a specific place name they are trying to say. Actually, looking closer: "train to a small farm town called meyer's couple". Could it be "Meilen" and "Küsnacht"? No. Let's assume the transcript is close enough to the garbled audio and keep it "Meyer's couple" to avoid inventing a place name that wasn't said, but clean the casing to "Meyer's Couple".)
    *   *Self-Correction:* Actually, looking at Zug history, they were in Baar mostly. But maybe they were in a farm town. I'll stick to the transcript's phonetic attempt but capitalize: "Meyer's Couple".
*   "Jeff Wilkie" -> "Jeffrey Wilcke" (From list).
*   "Gav" -> "Gavin" (First time usage? Transcript says "Gav", "Gavin". "Gav" is a nickname. I'll keep "Gav" if the speaker says "Gav", "Gavin" if they say "Gavin". But technical terms says "Gavin Wood". I will correct instances of "Gav" to "Gavin" if it refers to the person in the third person description, but maybe keep in dialogue if it sounds like a nickname. Actually, the speaker says "Gav" many times. I'll keep "Gav" for flow in dialogue, but "Gavin Wood" for full name.)
*   "Mihai Lissier" -> "Mihai Alisie" (From list).
*   "Amir Shetreat" -> "Amir Chetrit" (From list).
*   "Mariusz" -> "Mariusz?" (Transcript asks "Mariusz?". I will just remove the question mark if it's not part of the dialogue, or keep "Mariusz".)
*   "Nick Sabo" -> "Nick Szabo" (Correct spelling).
*   "Kiran" -> "Kieren" (Context: Kieren James-Lubin).
*   "Crowd sale" -> "crowdsale" (Standard Ethereum term, usually lowercase or CamelCase? Transcript uses "crowd sale". Standard is often "crowdsale". I will use "crowdsale" as one word).
*   "Red Wedding" -> "Red Wedding" (Event name).
*   "Ship" -> "ship".
*   "Web three" -> "Web3" (Technical term list says "Web3" is not there, but "decentralized web" is. However, "Web3" is standard. I'll capitalize Web3).

**Formatting Check:**
*   Timestamps preserved exactly.
*   Speaker labels preserved.
*   Consecutive speech merged.
*   Paragraph breaks for natural flow.

**Drafting the Content:**

**[02:14] SPEAKER_02:** That little love. Fantastic.

**[02:20] SPEAKER_03:** All here. Hello. Hello. We are back.

**[02:27] SPEAKER_00:** Great. Yeah. You know, technical difficulties, I suppose it's common. I think we wanted to start at five oh five. And so we are doing well on time. Thanks for everyone for jumping over. Just a friendly reminder, just throw any questions within the Twitter thread. I'll be keeping an eye on those. Hey, Mike. Thanks, Yum, for posting both two great comments in the thread. And then, yeah, like, share, repost. Got a great space ahead. And then with that, I guess we can get started, and I'll pass it over to Bob to introduce the speakers.

**[03:14] SPEAKER_01:** So, hi.

**[03:16] SPEAKER_02:** Welcome, everyone. So, yeah, really happy to have Taylor Garrick here as a guest. Back in late 2023, Kieren James-Lubin and Jim did a couple of videos on the early days of Ethereum, which I absolutely loved, being an Ethereum history buff as I am. And I made a whole load of notes on those, sufficient that they invited me on as a guest on the third edition. And I made a bunch of notes on that again. So we were talking through our own experiences from 2014 onwards to around late 2017 then. But yeah, just thought, especially with the 10th anniversary, that it would be great to have an OG on to talk about the early days and you don't get a lot more OG than Taylor. So welcome, Taylor. Hello.

**[04:26] SPEAKER_04:** Hello, everybody. And thank you very much for that kind introduction, Bob, and appreciate everybody. I'm honored to join you guys and maybe add a little bit to the story, fill in some gaps in the history that people might be wondering and do whatever I can do to get some chuckles out of the audience.

**[04:46] SPEAKER_02:** So, Taylor, do tell us something about yourself in general. Where are you from? What did your early years look like before you got involved in this nonsense?

**[05:02] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, sure. So I'm actually sitting in the town I was born in, in South Florida, where I was raised and raised. I probably spent the first 20 years of my life or so, a few more than that. I knew already way back when that I was super good with computers and kind of entered college university with the intention of like getting a degree in that realm. And that's what I did. I went to junior college first and then I finished my degree up in Orlando. was management of information systems. And the way I describe it is half business, half computers. And that turned out to be a fantastic skill set to kind of bring to the early days of Ethereum. You know, when it's just startup mode, things are just flying left, right, up, down, forward, every single direction. And there's not a lot of people paying attention to kind of how the business is supposed to work and be organized. And I thought that gave me a little bit of a leg up going in, understanding that we're going to have to submit receipts for things and they're going to have to be accounted for. And so I was a little more diligent with my early days activities because of that experience. But yeah, I left there to go to Chicago and got a lot of great experience in the companies and organizations I worked with up until the point where Honestly, I got tired of working with proprietary software, you know, from predominantly Microsoft houses. And I sort of moved shifting back towards open source software, kind of thinking back to when I first got started was doing like PHP MySQL. and uh found me at the right place right time to discover and learn about bitcoin and uh really fall into the whole world of open source decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain software so i just feel like i was a opportunity and uh luck meeting you know i was like I had, I was prepared for the right thing. I was in the right time, right place kind of situation and try to stay positioned there. And that way I could bring all my skill sets to a project that I was very passionate about.

**[07:19] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, were you, were you like a, you know, a libertarian, a cypherpunk, a gold bug, a prepper, any of that kind of flavor?

**[07:34] SPEAKER_04:** You know, honestly, I, I kind of had a little bit of a heads up about politics and. Uh, the whole left versus right, right thing and trying to, um, step away from that. But I had not really gotten into the super libertarian stuff. I wasn't really a precious metal guy. Uh, it was really, once I discovered Bitcoin and really understood it and those principles that we all kind of take to heart, once we finally joined the cult, um, That really stumbling upon Bitcoin is when I most embrace those kind of ideals, if you will, and certainly hold a lot of those still close to me today, even though it feels like as a whole industry or whatever, we're kind of out of practice. A lot of people just don't really think about the decentralization side, but that is definitely part of what what drew me in was the idea that wasn't controlled and that we all are contributing and even some more esoteric ideas like living in Hollands, like alternative communities and stuff. I'm fascinated by all that stuff, but I recognize there's some practical limitations with modern society on making that work.

**[08:50] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, yeah. So I mean, how long were you a Bitcoiner before you heard about Ethereum?

**[08:56] SPEAKER_04:** I discovered Bitcoin, I want to say in 2011. When I was clearing off a laptop, I... I saw I had the Bitcoin software downloaded, but it was still in testnet mode. I never figured out how to get out of testnet mode until when I really discovered the second time in 2012 and going into 2013. Then I continued working through 2013, doing some mining, trying to join various aspects of Bitcoin projects, writing about different alternative projects like Namecoin, Bitmessage and stuff. Um, and then I guess it would have been towards the end of that year was when I met Mihai Alisie in, uh, Milan, Italy, I think that was late 2013. And then Vitalik ended up giving his talk in Miami to announce Ethereum, uh, officially in, uh, 2014. So I guess, uh, maybe it was just over a year that I was like a pretty diehard Bitcoiner. And then, uh, just feeling like there's more to this whole blockchain technology and observing what everybody was trying to do with alternative things. Like I said, Namecoin was one of those like using blockchains for name resolution services. I saw the writing on the wall that there was something else to do with Bitcoin and I just didn't know what it was until I finally read Vitalik's paper three times and you know, it kind of clicked in my head that, ah, here's the way forward.

**[10:39] SPEAKER_02:** And you were working for some wallet company or involved with a wallet project when you were in Miami?

**[10:47] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. So I think at the time I wrote in on the Bitcoin dev mailing list about like trying to figure out, can we do a slider, like just normal UI slider that we use all the time for volume and whatever to adjust the fees and stuff for Bitcoin. Um, and that was at the behest of Wendell Davis who ran, uh, software company making Hive Bitcoin wallet it was supposed to be something super secure simple enough for like your parents to use um i think i had like tour network built in by default and he had taken an interest in some of the projects i was working on on top of bitcoin so probably most people don't know but the first project i wrote if you go on github there's a project called pay through p-a-y-t-h-r-u and the idea was can i pay bitcoin to people who haven't necessarily set up a bitcoin address yet so for example tipping on twitter tipping somebody's website things of that nature and so i kind of came up with a little system where it would generate a address to send the funds to If that person didn't have something pre-registered and I had a mechanism in place where if the person then, for example, put their Bitcoin address in their Twitter link, handle, profile, whatever, it could go scan that and it would pull that address out of there and then take the funds from the temporary address and forward them over the more permanent one. So it was kind of like a way to hold the funds. And then if you had an account and you're like, oh, I want to collect my tips, all I got to do is like put my own Bitcoin address on my website or on my Twitter profile. And then you could receive those funds without having to really do very much. I thought it was kind of an ingenious system. Some people didn't like it because of the technicalities of how Bitcoin has addresses and return addresses are not always return addresses. But, uh, I think it was novel and interesting enough that Wendell's saw the value that I could bring and my skillset, uh, to Hive Bitcoin wallet. And so I started working on that kind of on the, um, I guess it was like a very rudimentary DAP sort of interface. The wallet could, could have like plugin sort of things where you could click on. click on the DAP sort of thing. And because you're loading it in your own wallet, it already knows what your receiving address is. So it made it easy to like go to a website and interact with various services with knowing already some of your crypto information. So I started working on like plugins and things of that nature, making them refined. But once I learned about Ethereum, I found it really, really hard to want to keep working on the Mac only wallet because I just saw the impact of working on something that wasn't just focused on one platform. When it was very instrumental in kind of informing, like encouraging me, I guess is a better word, to go out and travel a little bit more and just be a nomad living out of my backpack. And it was because of that that I ended up going to Milan and meeting Mihai. And Mihai is the one who ended up connecting me to Vitalik and the rest of the team. So Wendell's definitely an instrumental part of my story with Ethereum.

**[14:37] SPEAKER_02:** Nice. Yeah, he's a bit of a mystery man, isn't he? last i heard he was in thailand uh i think with a wife i don't know if he was having kids or whatever but i kind of fell off the face of the earth to me i haven't heard from him in many many years no um he was he was at devcon doing a talk about grants actually and i i got my name on the screen i didn't get to go to london but i was i was on the screen as a named uh contributor to f embedded

**[15:08] SPEAKER_04:** so uh but yeah i didn't see him around in ethereum land much much beyond that kind of time line there there's a lot of that though a lot of people have uh you know they put in their contribution and they go attend to other aspects of life right life isn't just working about working on startups i mean uh some people want to have families and stuff so yeah There's a lot of people who have done their thing and gone off to greener pastures, whatever that means for them. And no hard feelings to any of those. I mean, I find myself in a similar space where I'm not contributing like I once was and trying to enjoy other facets of life. But I think it's just part of the natural cycle of things.

**[15:52] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, like I was saying on that Twitter thread last night, I think a crazy project I could do at some point would be trying to talk to and interview all of these early contributors, you know, 80 or 100 people. Many have forgotten to the mists of time, and many of those have probably never been really asked about their story or their experience.

**[16:15] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, and kind of to your point, it would be great to capture that because, especially with 10 years in the past, I know not all these memories are... being perfectly remembered and our brains are kind of faulty and it'd be nice to get some of it down in video or books or whatever just to capture all that for future posterity.

**[16:37] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, yeah, for sure. So, I mean, you mentioned Miami that so Bitcoin Miami was late January 2014 at very early February where Vitalik had his sort of announcing Ethereum first presentation at a conference. And then that was where I guess many of you got together to meet each other physically for the first time after a month or two of interactions. How was that?

**[17:10] SPEAKER_04:** uh a little nerve-wracking for a shy computer nerd to just meet up with a bunch of randos and uh i was kind of there with wendell and his group and then he had told us about these other people that rented a house and i don't think any of us had sorted rooms uh or figured out where we're staying and it was kind of like just turning into a crash space um so like i didn't know anybody hardly anybody and i was keeping myself a lot uh but it did turn out to be a very important time and place to be in the in the historical story of ethereum there were the vast majority of i'd say like some of the earliest people that had huge influences on ethereum's uh eventual launch a lot of those people got together physically for the first time there. I believe Jeffrey Wilcke was not able to go, but a lot of the other Europeans came over stateside for that. That was the first time that I met and sat down with Vitalik and we started working on some of the very basic ideas of what the website crowdsale sort of situation would need be. Although that all eventually changed. Um, one thing I like to point out is, uh, that conference, there's some photos, some of which I took in some of which others took, but, uh, So the way the story goes is that room was standing room only. He was in to give the announcement of Ethereum. And then afterwards, the questions kept coming in and kept coming in. And the organizers had to ask him to step outside. And I just remember these photos of him being mobbed by a group of people just wanting to ask him questions. I think Joseph Lubin was standing right there. Probably Anthony Di Iorio was probably real close. But that's a very iconic picture in my mind, at least. But anyway, the house that Anthony DiIorio had organized became kind of the hub and the central place where we all gathered around. I think Jonathan, is it Monaghan? Mohand, yeah. Um, he was doing some recording stuff there. I remember Charles Hoskinson being there out on the back patio with Joe and, and Mihai. Um, I was in my photography era, so I was doing more photo taking. Um, but I didn't know where to sleep and I had brought a hammock down with me. And so I ended up sleeping in the backyard, uh, on a hammock between two trees, looking out over the canal that ran past the house for two nights.

**[19:57] SPEAKER_02:** nice yeah saying with that iconic photograph i can't remember the guy's name now but at some point i i met the guy who's who had the speaking slot after vitalik and he said and everyone just started off it's like nobody left in the room for him that's that's got to be a tough act to follow you know yeah so so yeah saying about a great number of photos from January, March through July of 2014. So if you look on my Twitter thread from yesterday, I linked to some of those.

**[20:51] SPEAKER_04:** It was a really interesting time. I don't think anybody really knew what was going on. I just felt like documenting as much as I could while I was there was like. The way to do it, because everybody was just living in the moment.

**[21:12] SPEAKER_03:** We, um, Bob's audio was glitching for a little bit and now he's muted again. Um, can everyone hear me? Oh, I'm back. Okay.

**[21:23] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. What happened that? Um, yeah, I was just saying on that, on that thread, on the, on the photo thread that you got tailored, there was that sort of iconic, everyone crowding around, um, Vitalik, uh, yeah, with Anthony and, uh, and Joe there, and then some photos on your, on the back patio. And then there's that group shot, uh, with everyone there and, uh, and some other bits and pieces. So, so yeah, saying February the 9th was a day that we arrived in in Europe. So that's where the Zoog adventure began, early February.

**[22:07] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, it would be interesting to go back and check the actual timeline. I felt like things happened kind of fast. the where we landed in in zug was uh i mean landed in zurich but then we took the train to a small farm town called meyer's couple and uh there was a handful group there that was just staying in an airbnb and i i went along with uh my friend nick Fiero, who kind of came with me, we met up in, I think, Germany somewhere and continued on to Zurich. But we landed there and it was just very chaotic in the sense that nobody had a good sense of what was happening, on what timeline, for what reason. You know, whether it was just sleeping quarters or getting the website online or who was arriving, it was just constant chaos. But if I remember correctly, Charles came in the next day or two pretty soon thereafter. And then the house eventually filled up with Ian Meikle, who did all the artwork. And oh, gosh, I can't remember his buddy.

**[23:17] SPEAKER_02:** Richard Wilde.

**[23:18] SPEAKER_04:** Richard Wilde, that's right. Richard was actually the first one who was introduced to the project. He brought Ian along, and I think Ian ended up sticking around longer.

**[23:29] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Though he wasn't originally called Wilde. Funny little tidbit, that's actually his wife's surname that he took when they got married. I forget her name, though.

**[23:40] SPEAKER_03:** Really?

**[23:41] SPEAKER_02:** Yep. I guess he liked Wilde. It sounded cool. just assumed it was a pseudonymous uh name that he had picked and changed or something like that uh it could have been um but yeah i believe she had he he had a different name before her name jane jane wilde perhaps it was a pseudonym for them both who knows i mean at that point were other people like working together in other parts of the world have you got people together in uh you know, in London or New York as well at that point?

**[24:21] SPEAKER_04:** Unbeknownst to me, I thought Zug in Switzerland was kind of ground zero. And I think from a legal standpoint, that was probably true. But certainly from a code standpoint, it was not the case. And that, you know, led to some schisms down the road of like, the funny thing is like Game of Thrones was premiering every sunday uh while like ethereum's developing and uh switzerland was just like turned out to be one of the hubs right there was also berlin and london and amsterdam and toronto arguably and uh so it was like took a little bit of time but It started to become apparent there was definitely a Game of Thrones being played in many different ways. I think we were all very naive in the earliest of days. But as we're trying to get money to get into a permanent house, like what was called the spaceship, I started to feel some of the struggles and pains of like, hey, there's a bunch of other groups and everybody's vying for resources at this time. And then you start to get to deal with some of the other personalities. One of the things I, one of the fun stories I remember is dealing with the Germans and having to accept that, you know, Germans just talk in a certain way and it's not meant as like an offense. It's just how they speak. And you have to kind of just roll with that a little more purse, if you will. But being introduced to everybody around the world and having to work with everybody and um and and get those different personalities to mesh culturally or otherwise that that was a very interesting process we were pretty good i feel like in in the local hub and everybody that you saw on the daily um but it was like interesting once you started to get those other groups worked in and and try to like you know thinking about setting up a server for Gavin um we were crammed in a tiny little apartment and he wanted something set up and I didn't do it fast enough. And I definitely heard a little bit from him and I probably could have been faster, but I didn't realize he was kind of just waiting on the other end for me. Um, so yeah, it was, it was just very interesting. I was, I was in my own little bubble with the Switzerland crew, but then, uh, gosh, it was probably only a few weeks before we got moved up and out into a larger house and things became much more complicated, much more quickly.

**[27:01] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, just looking down through your photos, it says February the 9th is when you arrived in Europe. And then, yeah, February the 13th is when Stefan arrived at our tiny Airbnb.

**[27:18] SPEAKER_01:** And then there was something on the 22nd about moving in somewhere.

**[27:29] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, yeah, Richard and Ian arrived On February the 22nd and, uh, Airbnb.

**[27:38] SPEAKER_04:** So I guess that was a couple of few weeks of there before Ian and Richard arrived.

**[27:43] SPEAKER_02:** Right. Then I'm just looking in March, March photos, Charles bought dinner for 10 people on March the first watching fight club.

**[27:58] SPEAKER_04:** You know, like looking back and one thing that kind of stands out to me is it was definitely like a ragtag team of people there and trying to figure out what we were doing. Like this became a constant like a wedge in the group is like what our contribution was, right? from a code perspective and I was responsible for the website stuff. So I think to our credit, getting the team kind of motivated up and going to go from we just met and within a couple of few weeks here, we started spinning prototypes of the website and working together in our different capacities to kind of get this machine in motion and prepared for what would eventually become the crowdsale. It's like kind of No small task, I guess. Just having to learn how to get together and figure out your skills and know how you're going to plug into the rest of the global organization. But yeah, I think from February 12th, so just a few days after I landed, we kind of were up and moving on the website. And that was constantly a moving target too. Once we got additional legal guidance, and getting everybody's photos right and the right order and the right titles underneath. And that became a huge headache. And that wasn't even like the actual functioning app that took in Bitcoin and assigned like your key out. This was just months before in the run up to that. So it's just these personalities jiving, if you will.

**[29:36] SPEAKER_02:** I believe that at the Miami time or shortly afterwards, um it was announced that the crowd sale would happen like within a month or two months it was like a really super short timeline that was that was thought at that point um but then yeah i guess all of that got delayed both with technical and more importantly like legal concerns yeah getting getting kind of our a legal footing uh where we as a team felt comfortable proceeding and and it wasn't just like one or two guys right you have to get you know

**[30:10] SPEAKER_04:** eight, 10, 12 leaders going in the right same direction and get them to agree when they want vastly different things. But yeah, it was like, I think way back then the whole joke was two weeks, right? Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. Everything was two weeks away and two weeks eventually turns into months and months because the crowdsale wasn't until what? June, July? July, August?

**[30:36] SPEAKER_01:** I think July, August, September.

**[30:39] UNKNOWN:** Yeah.

**[30:39] SPEAKER_03:** It was like, and I ran for what, 49 days or something like that. And on the, so I was like in New York for the later part of this time. And it was funny to have the sort of stiff attorneys come by what was then our Times Square office, which is, I was there with Joe and Jonathan Mohan and Stephen Nareoff, now infamous. And yeah, I think there's always this global communication going on. And on the one hand, I think everyone was massaging the stiff law firm into... you know, what the parameters needed to be and the opinion letter and so on and so forth. And, you know, I think from a capability perspective, technically, that was probably running faster. Although we were not... I think Joe spent a ton of time on like the terms of service and the docs and did a lot of the support during the crowdsale. But yeah, it was like the app was being developed. Who built the app that generated the wallets? I'm forgetting his name. The Romanian guy? The Romanian guy, yeah. Mariusz? That might be right. He might have gone in. Did he go to work at ConsenSys afterwards? I think that might have been the case, but I could be misremembering. The ETH Stats app, I thought. I think that's right, too. Yeah. ETH Stats.

**[32:15] SPEAKER_04:** I forgot about that. There's a lot of old web attacks from the early days that it's like, I don't know. Some of it's what we're thinking, and some of it's like, I missed that.

**[32:30] SPEAKER_03:** Quite a lot of coordination overhead and I wasn't really in the center of it, but it was very visible. Sorry, go ahead, Bob.

**[32:40] SPEAKER_02:** So, I mean, were Vitalik, Gav and Jeff in Zug during those months or was it just like at that early bit, you know, in like February or so? Or were they not even there?

**[32:56] SPEAKER_04:** I don't remember Gav and Jeff coming to visit Zug until after some time. Primarily in the earliest days, I remember Vitalik coming there. And then once Zug became kind of like the legal home, we started doing more and more meetings in person there, board meetings, things that needed to happen face to face. I don't think either of them were super keen on it. Gav loved Berlin. Jeff had a lot of family ties and whatnot to Amsterdam, so he didn't like to leave overnight if he could help it. He might come for a day trip. But in the beginning, beginning days, Vitalik would come and stay for a while. And that was kind of nice, honestly.

**[33:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[33:43] SPEAKER_02:** Because, I mean, what was happening during those months was the parallel development of three different clients, right? You've got Pyethapp that Vitalik was working on. You've got Geth. that Jeff was leading, and then Gav building CPP Ethereum and speccing out the yellow paper. I mean, Jesus, Gav did so much work in those three months, like absolutely insane to get to the yellow paper so fast from there. So, yeah, I can imagine he was just heads down and did not really want to talk to people during his time up.

**[34:21] SPEAKER_04:** It felt like having Vitalik doing coding in Switzerland gave us a better balance because when Vitalik visited Berlin or Amsterdam, it just it felt like the code went in the direction of wherever two of the three main developers were.

**[34:37] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[34:39] SPEAKER_04:** And, you know, for better or worse, People realized that if they could bend Vitalik's ear, he had a difficult time saying no. And that means they could kind of set the agenda and direction of whatever they were trying to push, if you will. It was unfortunate that it was like... Way back then it was that easy to sway, but I think that's something Vitalik probably learned certainly by the time we launched the project. He was becoming more aware of how people would use him in that way. Yeah. But in the end, it all worked out. We all had the three different clients that were interoperable. To your point, the amount of work that had to go into the yellow paper to take everybody's discussion and codify it into something that was, even if imperfect, close enough for the clients to be developed totally siloed from each other. I still remark that as one of the best things that was accomplished, whoever's goal that was, probably Gavin's. Famously, I think, Bitcoin defined the implementation as the spec. And from a technical perspective, Ethereum had an actual spec and that you could derive any implementation you wanted from it. And that's something that the purest technology guy inside of me really appreciates.

**[36:09] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's... see it was it was a direct reaction to what happened in in bitcoin where satoshi had basically you know had this immaculate birth and then you could never really get to alternative implementations like even now really like it's never really nothing's ever really stuck and also i think just the act of of having that discipline of defining the spec and having multiple implementations, you know, that lets you triangulate between the different clients and say, oh, is there an ambiguity in the spec? So the spec, there's a bug in the spec, or is it a bug in a client? And then that's really had this sort of like division of powers kind of thing, right? That you haven't had a single group and a single code base and everything is stuck with that. you've had that kind of balance. And yeah, I mean, for the Haskell client, for Strato itself, you know, really benefited from that. You know, I mean, Kieren, if you can maybe say something about how that happened, that, you know, you could just build a new client.

**[37:29] SPEAKER_03:** So I think this was also, yes, one of the great things about Ethereum was that it was always a really big tent. It was very open, in a way too open to Taylor's point, right? But I think on balance, the attitude was right. And I think later projects have been run much more like companies, but Ethereum, especially early on, felt like kind of, amorphous open source builder collective, if you will. And so the spec was documented. And so I met our CTO Jim, I'm going to say September 2014. yes september 2014 or thereabouts and we started talking about it and um maybe unbeknownst to me after our first discussion he started implementing the haskell version of uh ethereum to the point that it could sync didn't have all of the features in it and i started coding on it January 2015 or maybe a little bit earlier than that. We would definitely find, you know, we'd like wake up one morning, it was syncing the night before, you'd pull the latest and like some big module was added, like, you know, dev P2P. It's like, oh, it takes an encryption now to, you know, connect and be able to sync the network. It didn't before and such like that. So, you know, I think there was definitely kind of like a, layers of access and consultation in terms of how the protocol evolved and so on. But it was cool. There were tests. We were like, you would run the VM tests and the results were provided and, you know, we would be, our CTO mostly would report on the percentage which passed, which would, you know, started. 80 or 90 percent and go up to 97 and then something would change and we go down to 90 again. And eventually we made it all work in the end. So it's a really hard thing to do. I mean, other industries certainly like the aim, of course, is to have Ethereum be a protocol like HTTP or any other. And I think this was achieved or at least largely achieved. It was tough, you know, and just the communications between the teams were not mature, I would say definitely kind of like whoever got to Vitalik last again to Taylor's point, but also sort of a insider outsider feeling was going on despite the openness of the project, almost a strange contradiction in terms. But all in all, it's been been a great run.

**[40:25] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I think if there's anything to learn from having been involved in Ethereum by any stretch of the imagination in the early days is that despite the fact that we were all working on this, you know, quote unquote fairness protocol, it didn't take away from the fact that it was like real human beings with real problems that still had to write the software. And it was a really big growing up time for me emotionally to understand that everybody's different, differing needs.

**[41:02] SPEAKER_02:** Something I observed a few years later was you've got to be very atypical to even be involved this early on, right? Getting involved in this stuff is not something that like a normie is going to do. You know, hey, there's this thing, it may or may not work, might be illegal, but, you know, off we go, give it a go. So I think you know, intrinsically, you know, these frontier folk prospective types, we're all a bit weird. So yeah, you get a bunch of those together, you're gonna get a lot of friction and misunderstanding. And maybe a lot of people not great communication or emotional skills either.

**[41:53] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, from that perspective, it was probably a special time and place that enabled us kind of pull together as we did i mean if it weren't for bitcoin meetups and people normalizing sort of getting together with this sort of stuff even though to your point you kind of got to have a decent case of the the autism to even be interested in throwing your life at this um i don't know that that it could be recreated um just getting that kind of group of people together that had the skills and were able to put together at least enough social skills to make it all work.

**[42:33] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's, yeah, a very sort of an exceptional situation and event. And I mean, maybe you could say, what do you think might come out of Ethereum? What do you think could be built? What, you know, what, were your thoughts on how this might pan out like in an ideal sense ethereum generally well is that what you're asking is like how yeah yeah yeah i mean what do you think ethereum was going to be what what what what did you think these this these efforts could lead to um i think i understood in the earliest days that there were a lot of other possibilities

**[43:20] SPEAKER_04:** Certainly 10 years down the road, we've explored a lot and found out some of them are more possible than others. I was also a large proponent of what Gavin was very into, which was like the three tent poles of decentralization. It was like storage and messaging and compute, I think. And that's something that I was very excited by. I think going back and looking at some of my early writings for Bitcoin Magazine on some other like online publications, I had already been investigating different protocols built around Bitcoin. And so I think I was most excited by this idea of like rebuilding I mean, it's kind of what we joke we call Web3, but I think it had a more concrete idea way back when, which was like Web2, but decentralized, something that wasn't controlled and owned by the corporations or had more like anonymous abilities so that we can continue to communicate online without having to worry about like a real ID or anything like this. So I think it was a lot closer to the cypherpunk ideal of like maintaining free and open access of the internet for everybody was kind of the core tenants that I felt most passionate about with respect to Ethereum. far more so than building prediction markets or like a CryptoKitties. Not that those things aren't interesting, but that wasn't necessarily my focus. My focus was on how do we maintain an open Internet in in light of the fact that we have corporations and governments that would like to apply censorship and control over it?

**[45:10] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, those three sub protocols were Ethereum, so your decentralized compute. Swarm, so Swarm is your decentralized storage with incentive Slayer on top of it. And then Whisper was the decentralized messaging. So Whisper kind of died. It didn't really work. It turns out there's a successor to that called Waku, which status have been developing for a good amount of time. Swarm is still going. but you know has ended up being very little used um ipfs like really sort of seem to win there apart from it hasn't got the incentive layer uh which is what filecoin is trying to build on top of that but you know I think um and this one other now what's it I forget the name but but yeah I think it's it's sort of like with all of these things you could do a decentralized anything, right. That you could, that you could have your, your smart contracts executing your logic, that decentralized storage could store like your, your web content, you know, that you have a hosted front end that was all kind of within that, that kind of system, you know, like a bit torrenty kind of thing, but with incentives, um, and then that, uh, that messaging there. So, yeah. that was really exciting to me as well because it's like oh here's like a computer here's a platform and you can do all of the things that you that you could do with a with the web too but in a completely you know unstoppable way with built-in payments and you can build whatever incentive mechanism you like and text just talked about like a social operating system do you or kieran or anybody else up up here do they do they

**[47:06] SPEAKER_04:** Does anyone feel that Ethereum didn't accomplish what it set out to accomplish in light of the fact that we really just shipped the compute layer? Do we miss the mark in any way?

**[47:19] SPEAKER_03:** You know, it's a great question. I think the... I think the answer is no, just in the sense that you put something out there and you don't really know how people are going to use it. The world computer was a really compelling vision. To your point, it didn't shake out exactly that way. It doesn't feel like a complete computer. It feels like an economy and is only doing certain parts of the economy. But I think that's totally okay. Just getting anything that changes how the world functions done is so important. And honestly, one probably needs to specialize in general from there. And probably what you see after Ethereum is yet more specialization. You know, our projects are way more narrowly tailored on average than Ethereum as a whole. So maybe it's just it was like too much to chew and like a little bit impossible, you know, in a way. And there's, you know, I mean, actually, I just don't hear that much about IPFS lately. Like, it doesn't feel like... the demand for sensor-proof everything on the internet is that strong right now? If something would have to happen for there to be really big uptake in need again. People have, to your point, kind of forgotten that part. And it may happen again. I mean, we see pretty strong speech controls coming out of the EU, especially as regards the internet. So we might see another wave, but even the attempts at sort of like crypto-native social have all been about... financialization versus uncensorability, the ones that have caught on to some degree. And financialization is also just really important, you know. But yeah, so maybe it's, you know, it's not the complete original vision, but it's not his fault. It's sort of like where the demand went, in my opinion.

**[49:37] SPEAKER_04:** What? what about do you either you guys this wasn't a part of my original question but i'm looking at the photos here and uh i don't know in in one case i kind of feel like the area that ethereum failed a little bit was the whole dowification of various aspects um Ethereum itself never really became a DAO. We tried the DAO and that had famously a bug that we had to have like a white hat hacker group help recover funds from. And then a lot of DAOs get set up today, which are essentially just money funnels. I don't know, maybe it was too out there of an idea, maybe not concrete enough for anything to be considered and reconciled as a DAO, but The whole turning things into a DAO just never seemed to transpire, even though it was technically possible with just a compute layer.

**[50:31] SPEAKER_03:** You know, and I'll throw it over to Bob in a second, but I think... It didn't happen. I agree. And I know both of you were kind of heavily involved with the foundation, which could have pushed that along harder or been sort of a legal brick and mortar host for the DAO as opposed to whatever it is and was. And we've seen a couple kind of work. It seems like the the DeFi DAOs are OK and they may be a little bit centralized in decision making and so on, but they actually seem to serve a purpose. And sometimes they're kind of like intimately involved in the protocols, like the Aave DAO or the Uniswap DAO, etc. So like people have been able to achieve it on Ethereum. Right. And so like, why didn't Ethereum itself achieve it? Also, I mean, there's things that could be done that aren't like we could take stake weighted votes on things, for instance. And I think it's never really been done other than stake staking itself. i don't know why like i think maybe later entrance sort of had to do it from a transparency perspective um but you know the the will i think it's a will thing more than anything you know everyone one it's like a really intense um effort just to keep the network up and so on and then it got really big and you didn't want to change it um kind of etc etc so Yeah, I agree it didn't happen, and I think it could have happened, and I don't know. You know, there's definitely a gap there, and I don't really know the why. I want to also put in beforehand to Bob, we should, before we let Taylor go, talk a little bit about the Red Wedding, but I'll throw it to Bob on this question.

**[52:34] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, for sure. So, I mean, just on the, you know, on that work three vision, you know, that the other leg's not landing, think the one that has been like a painful failing is to do with work front ends you know that many many applications though they may have you know smart contract back ends even without admin keys you know just code is law smart contracts they're often still going through a conventional work from a junction point, a failure point. Often legally, like that's happened a lot on privacy or mixing things is people get like done for hosting the front end, even if the smart contracts are immutable and out there. So that's been one problem area. I think part of that though is nobody wants to run servers like i think this was something that i had a quite different thought on at the beginning is like yeah you know everyone we can run decentralized everything right and it's all unstoppable and perfect but the fact is nobody wants to run servers like for anything like let alone like something that's really heavyweight um and i think that was kind of you know the vision you know say you have missed right you can run run a browser and it's going to have pull the things from Swarm and perfectly decentralized. But, you know, that stuff just, I think, was quite naive because the cost and overhead of running a node is really quite high, let alone if you want to get the throughput that you'd need for sort of worldwide trade. So, yeah. we've ended up with a lot less throughput and a lot less people running their own stuff. And then that's got all the complexities of L2. So, yeah. I think that's, I don't know how you solve that.

**[54:33] SPEAKER_04:** I hold Apple partially responsible for making such good laptops that everybody started switching over to laptops. I think way back then, a lot more people had desktops. So the idea of having idle storage and compute just sitting there was a greater thing. But now that a lot of people, myself included, don't even really bust out the laptop, I live on my phone, work on my phone, and there's no good way to support the network as a server client on the phone. So to some degree, it feels like the mobilification of all of our devices is to blame for some of those original issues. not panning out as we had hoped.

**[55:11] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, no, I'd agree. And I mean, I spent, the first thing I was doing on Ethereum was doing ARM Linux cross builds to get a client running on smartphones, smartwatch, Raspberry Pi and all of that. And I had the real naive view at that point. It's like, all right, yeah, just get it working. And, you know, there'll be some like client thing and, you know, you can just do everything right. And this will just be like a background task or, hey, you know, we're defining this protocol and like Ethereum will just be a protocol that will just be in operating systems. It will just be part of the Linux, you know, part of the Linux distro. You know, you're just right here. You've got Ethereum running in the background and, you know, off you go.

**[55:51] SPEAKER_04:** And that absolutely never really took off in the way that it was originally envisioned, I don't think.

**[55:59] SPEAKER_02:** No, no. And then on that DAO, the DAO question, I think maybe it's as simple as that, um, people don't care about lots of things, right? It's kind of like having a job, having to participate in a doubt. We have to try and understand what's going on. And like, you know, I don't, you know, I think that's a human scaling thing, right? It was a sort of a, we don't like hierarchy kind of naivety. You know, like hierarchies are a scaling mechanism. You know, they help us solve large scale problems by breaking things up. I think having hierarchies that you can never change and be powerless within is a terrible thing, but hierarchies per se, I think are very useful.

**[56:51] SPEAKER_03:** DAO is sort of like a condo association, right?

**[56:56] SPEAKER_02:** Very much so. Who wants to be involved in that?

**[57:01] SPEAKER_03:** Only one tyrant.

**[57:04] SPEAKER_02:** That's right. So, so yeah, talking about the red wedding or, or really just really the, you know, the birth of the Ethereum foundation, right. Because you were a, uh, you were a director on that at the start of the Ethereum foundation. So how, how did all that like resolve into, into what came out of that in the form of the. Yeah.

**[57:30] SPEAKER_04:** So I was, I had the dates, uh, clicked away on my timeline, but, um, The best way that I remember the story was there was unease cropping up with Charles, who seemed to have kind of lost the trust of the people that he claimed to want to be leading, and Amir Chetrit, who Um, a lot of people, myself were included, were kind of asking what contribution is this guy giving other than, uh, just being given a title of founder. Cause he was supposed to be responsible for all the stuff that I was actually doing. And he wasn't really involved, uh, like wasn't somebody I reported up to in any way. Um, and I think those kind of those conversations came to a head when he was wearing. swag of a different organization in toronto when we had that bitcoin expo 2014 and i ended up in the basement of uh the office there on the phone with uh like a cloudflare type company to provide ddos protection and i'm just like i don't understand why i'm on the phone holding having the big boy meeting and uh amir who's supposed to be doing this is not So I think just kind of the frustrations rose and it got to a point where some hard decisions had to be made because the organization definitely was not moving forward. Harold, I think on his part was a little bit more on the, let's set this up like Google and make it a corporation. And I was definitely more on the side of open source and making it available to everybody. So I don't know what kind of like weight that had in Vitalik's head when he was making his decisions, but it felt like to me in hindsight, it felt like a huge exhale after that whole incident happened. I feel like looking at the photos, you see pictures of like how much money we think we're gonna get, what we think we're gonna do with those funds. We started imagining up these DAO sort of ideas. Really started moving forward on a lot of things where it felt like we were kind of locked within the grasp of each other, trying to like fight it out, duke it out on who was going to win politically inside the org. I remember the day being very, very uncomfortable. Everybody had come to Zoog. There were girlfriends and partners there in addition to just like the people involved with Ethereum. And it was just very uncomfortable for a very long time. It was an emotionally exhausting day. And I think I have a picture of being on the back patio where we kind of all crammed in while Vitalik was just like on the front patio walking around trying to make his decision. And it was entirely up to him at that point. So who knows what would have happened if he had made the decision any other way. I like to think that And by choosing to put Stefan and myself in place in leadership positions and asking Amir and Charles to move on to other things, I feel like we had the team in place to actually get Ethereum delivered. And maybe it would have gotten delivered anyway, but I don't know. I feel like making the change when that happened is what ultimately enabled us to ship Ethereum in a relatively on-time way and doing what we all promised it would do.

**[1:01:24] SPEAKER_02:** So just to ask a little beyond that, so when that decision had been made, so the Ethereum Foundation was that illegal entity set up in Switzerland and you were one of three directors, is that right?

**[1:01:39] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, at first it was just Vitalik, Mihai and myself were the three people. Part of that was because we were the only three people physically present in Switzerland at the time. Everybody else was remoted in. And it just made things a lot more concrete to be signing a wet pen on dead tree, the people who are physically located inside the municipality. I served in that position for, I don't know, probably a few months, a handful of months before, you know, just truth be told, no shade at Gavin. We buried the hatchet as far as I'm aware, but, you know, Gavin was pushing very, very hard to not have Mihai and myself be involved on the board and that he eventually won that battle of attrition. We ended up signing some docs on a train one time to resign our positions from the board. And to the best of my knowledge, the board's never been faithfully repopulated. There's been a couple of times where some other people have been brought onto the board, but I don't think the board's ever really been truly flushed out in that way. Maybe that doesn't matter now. But the three of us were the first ones that actually created the entity. And that served as kind of the goalpost that we were aiming for and the legal restrictions we were going to abide by. uh, Switzerland was treating us really, really well up until that point. And they had offered us some very favorable, um, incentives to continue our progress there. And I think that's worked out well for them. They, they become like a crypto Valley in a way, um, uh, cottage industries popped up around it. So I think, you know, it all worked out in the end.

**[1:03:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So, um,

**[1:03:32] SPEAKER_04:** so yeah and uh so you not to go on too much longer but then the next phase was the phase of Ming so Ming arrived in 2015 right she um she cleared out some of the cruft which I think was very necessary a lot of people still had eyes organization but weren't as actively involved um To a degree myself included with that I my role kept changing with the org first it was scaling the initial website, then it was the crowdsale, then I started helping. On doing. Not QA work, but unit testing work on the Go Ethereum clients. So doing some coding there, writing the first complete RPC implementation was my responsibility. So some of the terrible namings of the functions, you can definitely blame me for those. And then eventually kind of like traveling around the world and speaking in places that Vitalik was too busy for or didn't desire to go to, I would kind of go do those talks. So my role had kept shifting and I wasn't the only one that maybe some of the positions that were valuable in the earliest of days were no longer as valuable. And she kind of had to come and clean house a little bit. And, uh, you know, to her credit, she, she did what she needed to do at that time.

**[1:05:07] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, there was, there was a lot of spending, wasn't there?

**[1:05:09] SPEAKER_02:** It was, um, I mean, I, I ended up joining the F in. January, February, 2016, uh, which was maybe about seven months after she'd joined, um, really as a consequence of, of the C++ team being cut. Um, you know, and then, because I, I think at that point it was like, there's only like four months of runway left at one point there with the spending rate that was, um, and F price had not even really taken off since the, since the crown sale. So it was, Uh, you know, that was actually when whisper and swarm both got their budgets cut entirely at that point. Um, along with the C plus plus team getting rid of the space ship and, uh, various other bits and pieces. Um, so yeah, maybe you just want one last piece then is, is later there in 2015, you had, you had DEVCON one, which was the very first, uh, you know, public. conference there in London, which nearly didn't happen because of that running out of money. And my understanding is really that Joe and Andrew at Consensys really funded that. So what are your memories of that first conference? How was it to have a big public conference and people interested and some big companies represented as well?

**[1:06:37] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. Your recollection is the same as mine in the sense that ConsenSys definitely carried the weight of that conference in terms of financial and organizational. From my standpoint, I remember being so thrilled to have an event that was like all our own. We had been crashing, you know, quote unquote, crashing Bitcoin sort of parties, which we were feeling less and less welcome to. Bitcoin Expo 2014, it was like we had a booth there, but there was a lot of, not concern, not criticism, but like just people were not entirely sure of what we had going on. and DevCon Zero being like an in-house kind of private only event. This was the first time that it felt like showing off a little bit. We had interests from, I think Microsoft was involved as a sponsor. Fun little fact, I had come up with the colored Ethereum logo with Microsoft colors and that ended up being adopted and being used as like a defacto logo for that conference.

**[1:08:01] SPEAKER_03:** That thing was everywhere.

**[1:08:03] SPEAKER_04:** I didn't know you did that.

**[1:08:04] SPEAKER_03:** It was all over the place.

**[1:08:06] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I think I just, I had done that in like something really basic just for like a blog post or something like that. But... It was really cool to have that. And then, um, we had the big Bitcoiner guy. I can't remember his name off top of my head.

**[1:08:24] SPEAKER_01:** Um, yeah.

**[1:08:27] SPEAKER_04:** What was the last name? Nick. nick sabo sabo yes yes nick sabo yes he was there as well and i felt very excited about like feeling like we had support from both sides of uh old school bitcoiners even if he was paid to be there or whatever and also um like interest from the corporate side of like Microsoft, that felt like we had finally made it in a way of acceptance, even though the number on the coin wasn't high at the time. It was like, wow, there's literally a room full of people here. not just like techie teams but people in business development and other facets that were interested in what was going on in this community space and it felt like uh acceptance i guess is the best way that i can say i felt um it was a special time for sure so yeah i mean nick salvo famously the inventor of uh of smart contracts or the term smart contract uh

**[1:09:37] SPEAKER_02:** So, yeah.

**[1:09:41] SPEAKER_03:** I have to interject. It felt like during his presentation, he strongly implied he invented Bitcoin. Like he almost put it on the screen, you know, like 2003 is the timeframe or something. He didn't come out and say it, but it was funny.

**[1:10:04] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I, I'm trying to remember what year it was. It was, it was like, oh, 1994 is smart contracts were, was, uh, turned quite, quite a while back.

**[1:10:17] SPEAKER_01:** Um, okay.

**[1:10:22] SPEAKER_02:** I think, I think that's maybe a good point to leave it unless Kieren and Taylor would like to talk a little bit about, uh, about football.

**[1:10:33] SPEAKER_01:** I only talk about golf these days.

**[1:10:38] SPEAKER_03:** I think we can close it there and are incredibly appreciative of Taylor coming on. Actually, for the audience also, you know, on fairly short notice. So thank you and, you know, happy 10 years to Ethereum. And hopefully you'll come back. There's lots more story. But thanks, Bob, for leading us through it.

**[1:11:05] SPEAKER_01:** Okay. Thanks so much, Taylor. Thanks, everyone, for coming. Have a great week. All the best. Thank you, everybody.**[02:14] SPEAKER_02:** That little love. Fantastic.

**[02:20] SPEAKER_03:** All here. Hello. Hello. We are back.

**[02:27] SPEAKER_00:** Great. Yeah. You know, technical difficulties, I suppose it's common. I think we wanted to start at five oh five. And so we are doing well on time. Thanks for everyone for jumping over. Just a friendly reminder, just throw any questions within the Twitter thread. I'll be keeping an eye on those. Hey, Mike. Thanks, Yum, for posting both two great comments in the thread. And then, yeah, like, share, repost. Got a great space ahead. And then with that, I guess we can get started, and I'll pass it over to Bob to introduce the speakers.

**[03:14] SPEAKER_01:** So, hi.

**[03:16] SPEAKER_02:** Welcome, everyone. So, yeah, really happy to have Taylor Garrick here as a guest. Back in late 2023, Kieren James-Lubin and Jim did a couple of videos on the early days of Ethereum, which I absolutely loved, being an Ethereum history buff as I am. And I made a whole load of notes on those, sufficient that they invited me on as a guest on the third edition. And I made a bunch of notes on that again. So we were talking through our own experiences from 2014 onwards to around late 2017 then. But yeah, just thought, especially with the 10th anniversary, that it would be great to have an OG on to talk about the early days and you don't get a lot more OG than Taylor. So welcome, Taylor. Hello.

**[04:26] SPEAKER_04:** Hello, everybody. And thank you very much for that kind introduction, Bob, and appreciate everybody. I'm honored to join you guys and maybe add a little bit to the story, fill in some gaps in the history that people might be wondering and do whatever I can do to get some chuckles out of the audience.

**[04:46] SPEAKER_02:** So, Taylor, do tell us something about yourself in general. Where are you from? What did your early years look like before you got involved in this nonsense?

**[05:02] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, sure. So I'm actually sitting in the town I was born in, in South Florida, where I was raised and raised. I probably spent the first 20 years of my life or so, a few more than that. I knew already way back when that I was super good with computers and kind of entered college university with the intention of like getting a degree in that realm. And that's what I did. I went to junior college first and then I finished my degree up in Orlando. was management of information systems. And the way I describe it is half business, half computers. And that turned out to be a fantastic skill set to kind of bring to the early days of Ethereum. You know, when it's just startup mode, things are just flying left, right, up, down, forward, every single direction. And there's not a lot of people paying attention to kind of how the business is supposed to work and be organized. And I thought that gave me a little bit of a leg up going in, understanding that we're going to have to submit receipts for things and they're going to have to be accounted for. And so I was a little more diligent with my early days activities because of that experience. But yeah, I left there to go to Chicago and got a lot of great experience in the companies and organizations I worked with up until the point where Honestly, I got tired of working with proprietary software, you know, from predominantly Microsoft houses. And I sort of moved shifting back towards open source software, kind of thinking back to when I first got started was doing like PHP MySQL. and uh found me at the right place right time to discover and learn about bitcoin and uh really fall into the whole world of open source decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain software so i just feel like i was a opportunity and uh luck meeting you know i was like I had, I was prepared for the right thing. I was in the right time, right place kind of situation and try to stay positioned there. And that way I could bring all my skill sets to a project that I was very passionate about.

**[07:19] SPEAKER_02:** I mean, were you, were you like a, you know, a libertarian, a cypherpunk, a gold bug, a prepper, any of that kind of flavor?

**[07:34] SPEAKER_04:** You know, honestly, I, uh, I kind of had a little bit of a heads up about politics and. Uh, the whole left versus right, right thing and trying to, um, step away from that. But I had not really gotten into the super libertarian stuff. I wasn't really a precious metal guy. Uh, it was really, once I discovered Bitcoin and really understood it and those principles that we all kind of take to heart, once we finally joined the cult, um, That really stumbling upon Bitcoin is when I most embrace those kind of ideals, if you will, and certainly hold a lot of those still close to me today, even though it feels like as a whole industry or whatever, we're kind of out of practice. A lot of people just don't really think about the decentralization side, but that is definitely part of what what drew me in was the idea that wasn't controlled and that we all are contributing and even some more esoteric ideas like living in Hollands, like alternative communities and stuff. I'm fascinated by all that stuff, but I recognize there's some practical limitations with modern society on making that work.

**[08:50] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, yeah. So I mean, how long were you a Bitcoiner before you heard about Ethereum?

**[08:56] SPEAKER_04:** I discovered Bitcoin, I want to say in 2011. When I was clearing off a laptop, I... I saw I had the Bitcoin software downloaded, but it was still in testnet mode. I never figured out how to get out of testnet mode until when I really discovered the second time in 2012 and going into 2013. Then I continued working through 2013, doing some mining, trying to join various aspects of Bitcoin projects, writing about different alternative projects like Namecoin, Bitmessage and stuff. Um, and then I guess it would have been towards the end of that year was when I met Mihai Alisie in, uh, Milan, Italy, I think that was late 2013. And then Vitalik ended up giving his talk in Miami to announce Ethereum, uh, officially in, uh, 2014. So I guess, uh, maybe it was just over a year that I was like a pretty diehard Bitcoiner. And then, uh, just feeling like there's more to this whole blockchain technology and observing what everybody was trying to do with alternative things. Like I said, Namecoin was one of those like using blockchains for name resolution services. I saw the writing on the wall that there was something else to do with Bitcoin and I just didn't know what it was until I finally read Vitalik's paper three times and you know, it kind of clicked in my head that, ah, here's the way forward.

**[10:39] SPEAKER_02:** And you were working for some wallet company or involved with a wallet project when you were in Miami?

**[10:47] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. So I think at the time I wrote in on the Bitcoin dev mailing list about like trying to figure out, can we do a slider, like just normal UI slider that we use all the time for volume and whatever to adjust the fees and stuff for Bitcoin. Um, and that was at the behest of Wendell Davis who ran, uh, software company making Hive Bitcoin wallet it was supposed to be something super secure simple enough for like your parents to use um i think i had like tour network built in by default and he had taken an interest in some of the projects i was working on on top of bitcoin so probably most people don't know but the first project i wrote if you go on github there's a project called pay through p-a-y-t-h-r-u and the idea was can i pay bitcoin to people who haven't necessarily set up a bitcoin address yet so for example tipping on twitter tipping somebody's website things of that nature and so i kind of came up with a little system where it would generate a address to send the funds to If that person didn't have something pre-registered and I had a mechanism in place where if the person then, for example, put their Bitcoin address in their Twitter link, handle, profile, whatever, it could go scan that and it would pull that address out of there and then take the funds from the temporary address and forward them over the more permanent one. So it was kind of like a way to hold the funds. And then if you had an account and you're like, oh, I want to collect my tips, all I got to do is like put my own Bitcoin address on my website or on my Twitter profile. And then you could receive those funds without having to really do very much. I thought it was kind of an ingenious system. Some people didn't like it because of the technicalities of how Bitcoin has addresses and return addresses are not always return addresses. But, uh, I think it was novel and interesting enough that Wendell's saw the value that I could bring and my skillset, uh, to Hive Bitcoin wallet. And so I started working on that kind of on the, um, I guess it was like a very rudimentary DAP sort of interface. The wallet could, could have like plugin sort of things where you could click on. click on the DAP sort of thing. And because you're loading it in your own wallet, it already knows what your receiving address is. So it made it easy to like go to a website and interact with various services with knowing already some of your crypto information. So I started working on like plugins and things of that nature, making them refined. But once I learned about Ethereum, I found it really, really hard to want to keep working on the Mac only wallet because I just saw the impact of working on something that wasn't just focused on one platform. When it was very instrumental in kind of informing, like encouraging me, I guess is a better word, to go out and travel a little bit more and just be a nomad living out of my backpack. And it was because of that that I ended up going to Milan and meeting Mihai. And Mihai is the one who ended up connecting me to Vitalik and the rest of the team. So Wendell's definitely an instrumental part of my story with Ethereum.

**[14:37] SPEAKER_02:** Nice. Yeah, he's a bit of a mystery man, isn't he? last i heard he was in thailand uh i think with a wife i don't know if he was having kids or whatever but i kind of fell off the face of the earth to me i haven't heard from him in many many years no um he was he was at devcon doing a talk about grants actually and i i got my name on the screen i didn't get to go to london but i was i was on the screen as a named uh contributor to embedded

**[15:08] SPEAKER_04:** so uh but yeah i didn't see him around in ethereum land much much beyond that kind of time line there there's a lot of that though a lot of people have uh you know they put in their contribution and they go attend to other aspects of life right life isn't just working about working on startups i mean uh some people want to have families and stuff so yeah There's a lot of people who have done their thing and gone off to greener pastures, whatever that means for them. And no hard feelings to any of those. I mean, I find myself in a similar space where I'm not contributing like I once was and trying to enjoy other facets of life. But I think it's just part of the natural cycle of things.

**[15:52] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, like I was saying on that Twitter thread last night, I think a crazy project I could do at some point would be trying to talk to and interview all of these early contributors, you know, 80 or 100 people. Many have forgotten to the mists of time, and many of those have probably never been really asked about their story or their experience.

**[16:15] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, and kind of to your point, it would be great to capture that because, especially with 10 years in the past, I know not all these memories are... being perfectly remembered and our brains are kind of faulty and it'd be nice to get some of it down in video or books or whatever just to capture all that for future posterity.

**[16:37] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, yeah, for sure. So, I mean, you mentioned Miami that so Bitcoin Miami was late January 2014 at very early February where Vitalik had his sort of announcing Ethereum first presentation at a conference. And then that was where I guess many of you got together to meet each other physically for the first time after a month or two of interactions. How was that?

**[17:10] SPEAKER_04:** uh a little nerve-wracking for a shy computer nerd to just meet up with a bunch of randos and uh i was kind of there with wendell and his group and then he had told us about these other people that rented a house and i don't think any of us had sorted rooms uh or figured out where we're staying and it was kind of like just turning into a crash space um so like i didn't know anybody hardly anybody and i was keeping myself a lot uh but it did turn out to be a very important time and place to be in the in the historical story of ethereum there were the vast majority of i'd say like some of the earliest people that had huge influences on ethereum's uh eventual launch a lot of those people got together physically for the first time there. I believe Jeffrey Wilcke was not able to go, but a lot of the other Europeans came over stateside for that. That was the first time that I met and sat down with Vitalik and we started working on some of the very basic ideas of what the website crowdsale sort of situation would need be. Although that all eventually changed. Um, one thing I like to point out is, uh, that conference, there's some photos, some of which I took in some of which others took, but, uh, So the way the story goes is that room was standing room only. He was in to give the announcement of Ethereum. And then afterwards, the questions kept coming in and kept coming in. And the organizers had to ask him to step outside. And I just remember these photos of him being mobbed by a group of people just wanting to ask him questions. I think Joseph Lubin was standing right there. Probably Anthony Di Iorio was probably real close. But that's a very iconic picture in my mind, at least. But anyway, the house that Anthony DiIorio had organized became kind of the hub and the central place where we all gathered around. I think Jonathan, is it Monaghan? Mohand, yeah. Um, he was doing some recording stuff there. I remember Charles Hoskinson being there out on the back patio with Joe and, and Mihai. Um, I was in my photography era, so I was doing more photo taking. Um, but I didn't know where to sleep and I had brought a hammock down with me. And so I ended up sleeping in the backyard, uh, on a hammock between two trees, looking out over the canal that ran past the house for two nights.

**[19:57] SPEAKER_02:** nice yeah saying with that iconic photograph i can't remember the guy's name now but at some point i i met the guy who's who had the speaking slot after vitalik and he said and everyone just started off it's like nobody left in the room for him that's that's got to be a tough act to follow you know yeah so so yeah saying about a great number of photos from January, March through July of 2014. So if you look on my Twitter thread from yesterday, I linked to some of those.

**[20:51] SPEAKER_04:** It was a really interesting time. I don't think anybody really knew what was going on. I just felt like documenting as much as I could while I was there was like. The way to do it, because everybody was just living in the moment.

**[21:12] SPEAKER_03:** We, um, Bob's audio was glitching for a little bit and now he's muted again. Um, can everyone hear me? Oh, I'm back. Okay.

**[21:23] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. What happened that? Um, yeah, I was just saying on that, on that thread, on the, on the photo thread that you got tailored, there was that sort of iconic, everyone crowding around, um, Vitalik, uh, yeah, with Anthony and, uh, and Joe there, and then some photos on your, on the back patio. And then there's that group shot, uh, with everyone there and, uh, and some other bits and pieces. So, so yeah, saying February the 9th was a day that we arrived in in Europe. So that's where the Zoog adventure began, early February.

**[22:07] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, it would be interesting to go back and check the actual timeline. I felt like things happened kind of fast. the where we landed in in zug was uh i mean landed in zurich but then we took the train to a small farm town called meyer's couple and uh there was a handful group there that was just staying in an airbnb and i i went along with uh my friend nick Fiero, who kind of came with me, we met up in, I think, Germany somewhere and continued on to Zurich. But we landed there and it was just very chaotic in the sense that nobody had a good sense of what was happening, on what timeline, for what reason. You know, whether it was just sleeping quarters or getting the website online or who was arriving, it was just constant chaos. But if I remember correctly, Charles came in the next day or two pretty soon thereafter. And then the house eventually filled up with Ian Meikle, who did all the artwork. And oh, gosh, I can't remember his buddy.

**[23:17] SPEAKER_02:** Richard Wilde.

**[23:18] SPEAKER_04:** Richard Wilde, that's right. Richard was actually the first one who was introduced to the project. He brought Ian along, and I think Ian ended up sticking around longer.

**[23:29] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Though he wasn't originally called Wilde. Funny little tidbit, that's actually his wife's surname that he took when they got married. I forget her name, though.

**[23:40] SPEAKER_03:** Really?

**[23:41] SPEAKER_02:** Yep. I guess he liked Wilde. It sounded cool. just assumed it was a pseudonymous uh name that he had picked and changed or something like that uh it could have been um but yeah i believe she had he he had a different name before her name jane jane wilde perhaps it was a pseudonym for them both who knows i mean at that point were other people like working together in other parts of the world have you got people together in uh you know, in London or New York as well at that point?

**[24:21] SPEAKER_04:** Unbeknownst to me, I thought Zug in Switzerland was kind of ground zero. And I think from a legal standpoint, that was probably true. But certainly from a code standpoint, it was not the case. And that, you know, led to some schisms down the road of like, the funny thing is like Game of Thrones was premiering every sunday uh while like ethereum's developing and uh switzerland was just like turned out to be one of the hubs right there was also berlin and london and amsterdam and toronto arguably and uh so it was like took a little bit of time but It started to become apparent there was definitely a Game of Thrones being played in many different ways. I think we were all very naive in the earliest of days. But as we're trying to get money to get into a permanent house, like what was called the spaceship, I started to feel some of the struggles and pains of like, hey, there's a bunch of other groups and everybody's vying for resources at this time. And then you start to get to deal with some of the other personalities. One of the things I, one of the fun stories I remember is dealing with the Germans and having to accept that, you know, Germans just talk in a certain way and it's not meant as like an offense. It's just how they speak. And you have to kind of just roll with that a little more purse, if you will. But being introduced to everybody around the world and having to work with everybody and um and and get those different personalities to mesh culturally or otherwise that that was a very interesting process we were pretty good i feel like in in the local hub and everybody that you saw on the daily um but it was like interesting once you started to get those other groups worked in and and try to like you know thinking about setting up a server for Gavin um we were crammed in a tiny little apartment and he wanted something set up and I didn't do it fast enough. And I definitely heard a little bit from him and I probably could have been faster, but I didn't realize he was kind of just waiting on the other end for me. Um, so yeah, it was, it was just very interesting. I was, I was in my own little bubble with the Switzerland crew, but then, uh, gosh, it was probably only a few weeks before we got moved up and out into a larger house and things became much more complicated, much more quickly.

**[27:01] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, just looking down through your photos, it says February the 9th is when you arrived in Europe. And then, yeah, February the 13th is when Stefan arrived at our tiny Airbnb.

**[27:18] SPEAKER_01:** And then there was something on the 22nd about moving in somewhere.

**[27:29] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, yeah, Richard and Ian arrived On February the 22nd and, uh, Airbnb.

**[27:38] SPEAKER_04:** So I guess that was a couple of few weeks of there before Ian and Richard arrived.

**[27:43] SPEAKER_02:** Right. Then I'm just looking in March, March photos, Charles bought dinner for 10 people on March the first watching fight club.

**[27:58] SPEAKER_04:** You know, like looking back and one thing that kind of stands out to me is it was definitely like a ragtag team of people there and trying to figure out what we were doing. Like this became a constant like a wedge in the group is like what our contribution was, right? from a code perspective and I was responsible for the website stuff. So I think to our credit, getting the team kind of motivated up and going to go from we just met and within a couple of few weeks here, we started spinning prototypes of the website and working together in our different capacities to kind of get this machine in motion and prepared for what would eventually become the crowdsale. It's like kind of No small task, I guess. Just having to learn how to get together and figure out your skills and know how you're going to plug into the rest of the global organization. But yeah, I think from February 12th, so just a few days after I landed, we kind of were up and moving on the website. And that was constantly a moving target too. Once we got additional legal guidance, and getting everybody's photos right and the right order and the right titles underneath. And that became a huge headache. And that wasn't even like the actual functioning app that took in Bitcoin and assigned like your key out. This was just months before in the run up to that. So it's just these personalities jiving, if you will.

**[29:36] SPEAKER_02:** I believe that at the Miami time or shortly afterwards, um it was announced that the crowd sale would happen like within a month or two months it was like a really super short timeline that was that was thought at that point um but then yeah i guess all of that got delayed both with technical and more importantly like legal concerns yeah getting getting kind of our a legal footing uh where we as a team felt comfortable proceeding and and it wasn't just like one or two guys right you have to get you know

**[30:10] SPEAKER_04:** eight, 10, 12 leaders going in the right same direction and get them to agree when they want vastly different things. But yeah, it was like, I think way back then the whole joke was two weeks, right? Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. Everything was two weeks away and two weeks eventually turns into months and months because the crowdsale wasn't until what? June, July? July, August?

**[30:36] SPEAKER_01:** I think July, August, September.

**[30:39] UNKNOWN:** Yeah.

**[30:39] SPEAKER_03:** It was like, and I ran for what, 49 days or something like that. And on the, so I was like in New York for the later part of this time. And it was funny to have the sort of stiff attorneys come by what was then our Times Square office, which is, I was there with Joe and Jonathan Mohan and Stephen Nareoff, now infamous. And yeah, I think there's always this global communication going on. And on the one hand, I think everyone was massaging the stiff law firm into... you know, what the parameters needed to be and the opinion letter and so on and so forth. And, you know, I think from a capability perspective, technically, that was probably running faster. Although we were not... I think Joe spent a ton of time on like the terms of service and the docs and did a lot of the support during the crowdsale. But yeah, it was like the app was being developed. Who built the app that generated the wallets? I'm forgetting his name. The Romanian guy? The Romanian guy, yeah. Mariusz? That might be right. He might have gone in. Did he go to work at ConsenSys afterwards? I think that might have been the case, but I could be misremembering. The ETH Stats app, I thought. I think that's right, too. Yeah. ETH Stats.

**[32:15] SPEAKER_04:** I forgot about that. There's a lot of old web attacks from the early days that it's like, I don't know. Some of it's what we're thinking, and some of it's like, I missed that.

**[32:30] SPEAKER_03:** Quite a lot of coordination overhead and I wasn't really in the center of it, but it was very visible. Sorry, go ahead, Bob.

**[32:40] SPEAKER_02:** So, I mean, were Vitalik, Gav and Jeff in Zug during those months or was it just like at that early bit, you know, in like February or so? Or were they not even there?

**[32:56] SPEAKER_04:** I don't remember Gav and Jeff coming to visit Zug until after some time. Primarily in the earliest days, I remember Vitalik coming there. And then once Zug became kind of like the legal home, we started doing more and more meetings in person there, board meetings, things that needed to happen face to face. I don't think either of them were super keen on it. Gav loved Berlin. Jeff had a lot of family ties and whatnot to Amsterdam, so he didn't like to leave overnight if he could help it. He might come for a day trip. But in the beginning, beginning days, Vitalik would come and stay for a while. And that was kind of nice, honestly.

**[33:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[33:43] SPEAKER_02:** Because, I mean, what was happening during those months was the parallel development of three different clients, right? You've got Pyethapp that Vitalik was working on. You've got Geth. that Jeff was leading, and then Gav building CPP Ethereum and speccing out the yellow paper. I mean, Jesus, Gav did so much work in those three months, like absolutely insane to get to the yellow paper so fast from there. So, yeah, I can imagine he was just heads down and did not really want to talk to people during his time up.

**[34:21] SPEAKER_04:** It felt like having Vitalik doing coding in Switzerland gave us a better balance because when Vitalik visited Berlin or Amsterdam, it just it felt like the code went in the direction of wherever two of the three main developers were.

**[34:37] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[34:39] SPEAKER_04:** And, you know, for better or worse, People realized that if they could bend Vitalik's ear, he had a difficult time saying no. And that means they could kind of set the agenda and direction of whatever they were trying to push, if you will. It was unfortunate that it was like... Way back then it was that easy to sway, but I think that's something Vitalik probably learned certainly by the time we launched the project. He was becoming more aware of how people would use him in that way. Yeah. But in the end, it all worked out. We all had the three different clients that were interoperable. To your point, the amount of work that had to go into the yellow paper to take everybody's discussion and codify it into something that was, even if imperfect, close enough for the clients to be developed totally siloed from each other. I still remark that as one of the best things that was accomplished, whoever's goal that was, probably Gavin's. Famously, I think, Bitcoin defined the implementation as the spec. And from a technical perspective, Ethereum had an actual spec and that you could derive any implementation you wanted from it. And that's something that the purest technology guy inside of me really appreciates.

**[36:09] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's... see it was it was a direct reaction to what happened in in bitcoin where satoshi had basically you know had this immaculate birth and then you could never really get to alternative implementations like even now really like it's never really nothing's ever really stuck and also i think just the act of of having that discipline of defining the spec and having multiple implementations, you know, that lets you triangulate between the different clients and say, oh, is there an ambiguity in the spec? So the spec, there's a bug in the spec, or is it a bug in a client? And then that's really had this sort of like division of powers kind of thing, right? That you haven't had a single group and a single code base and everything is stuck with that. you've had that kind of balance. And yeah, I mean, for the Haskell client, for Strato itself, you know, really benefited from that. You know, I mean, Kieren, if you can maybe say something about how that happened, that, you know, you could just build a new client.

**[37:29] SPEAKER_03:** So I think this was also, yes, one of the great things about Ethereum was that it was always a really big tent. It was very open, in a way too open to Taylor's point, right? But I think on balance, the attitude was right. And I think later projects have been run much more like companies, but Ethereum, especially early on, felt like kind of, amorphous open source builder collective, if you will. And so the spec was documented. And so I met our CTO Jim, I'm going to say September 2014. yes september 2014 or thereabouts and we started talking about it and um maybe unbeknownst to me after our first discussion he started implementing the haskell version of uh ethereum to the point that it could sync didn't have all of the features in it and i started coding on it January 2015 or maybe a little bit earlier than that. We would definitely find, you know, we'd like wake up one morning, it was syncing the night before, you'd pull the latest and like some big module was added, like, you know, dev P2P. It's like, oh, it takes an encryption now to, you know, connect and be able to sync the network. It didn't before and such like that. So, you know, I think there was definitely kind of like a, layers of access and consultation in terms of how the protocol evolved and so on. But it was cool. There were tests. We were like, you would run the VM tests and the results were provided and, you know, we would be, our CTO mostly would report on the percentage which passed, which would, you know, started. 80 or 90 percent and go up to 97 and then something would change and we go down to 90 again. And eventually we made it all work in the end. So it's a really hard thing to do. I mean, other industries certainly like the aim, of course, is to have Ethereum be a protocol like HTTP or any other. And I think this was achieved or at least largely achieved. It was tough, you know, and just the communications between the teams were not mature, I would say definitely kind of like whoever got to Vitalik last again to Taylor's point, but also sort of a insider outsider feeling was going on despite the openness of the project, almost a strange contradiction in terms. But all in all, it's been been a great run.

**[40:25] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I think if there's anything to learn from having been involved in Ethereum by any stretch of the imagination in the early days is that despite the fact that we were all working on this, you know, quote unquote fairness protocol, it didn't take away from the fact that it was like real human beings with real problems that still had to write the software. And it was a really big growing up time for me emotionally to understand that everybody's different, differing needs.

**[41:02] SPEAKER_02:** Something I observed a few years later was you've got to be very atypical to even be involved this early on, right? Getting involved in this stuff is not something that like a normie is going to do. You know, hey, there's this thing, it may or may not work, might be illegal, but, you know, off we go, give it a go. So I think you know, intrinsically, you know, these frontier folk prospective types, we're all a bit weird. So yeah, you get a bunch of those together, you're gonna get a lot of friction and misunderstanding. And maybe a lot of people not great communication or emotional skills either.

**[41:53] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, from that perspective, it was probably a special time and place that enabled us kind of pull together as we did i mean if it weren't for bitcoin meetups and people normalizing sort of getting together with this sort of stuff even though to your point you kind of got to have a decent case of the the autism to even be interested in throwing your life at this um i don't know that that it could be recreated um just getting that kind of group of people together that had the skills and were able to put together at least enough social skills to make it all work.

**[42:33] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's, yeah, a very sort of an exceptional situation and event. And I mean, maybe you could say, what do you think might come out of Ethereum? What do you think could be built? What, you know, what, were your thoughts on how this might pan out like in an ideal sense ethereum generally well is that what you're asking is like how yeah yeah yeah i mean what do you think ethereum was going to be what what what what did you think these this these efforts could lead to um i think i understood in the earliest days that there were a lot of other possibilities

**[43:20] SPEAKER_04:** Certainly 10 years down the road, we've explored a lot and found out some of them are more possible than others. I was also a large proponent of what Gavin was very into, which was like the three tent poles of decentralization. It was like storage and messaging and compute, I think. And that's something that I was very excited by. I think going back and looking at some of my early writings for Bitcoin Magazine on some other like online publications, I had already been investigating different protocols built around Bitcoin. And so I think I was most excited by this idea of like rebuilding I mean, it's kind of what we joke we call Web3, but I think it had a more concrete idea way back when, which was like Web2, but decentralized, something that wasn't controlled and owned by the corporations or had more like anonymous abilities so that we can continue to communicate online without having to worry about like a real ID or anything like this. So I think it was a lot closer to the cypherpunk ideal of like maintaining free and open access of the internet for everybody was kind of the core tenants that I felt most passionate about with respect to Ethereum. far more so than building prediction markets or like a CryptoKitties. Not that those things aren't interesting, but that wasn't necessarily my focus. My focus was on how do we maintain an open Internet in in light of the fact that we have corporations and governments that would like to apply censorship and control over it?

**[45:10] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, those three sub protocols were Ethereum, so your decentralized compute. Swarm, so Swarm is your decentralized storage with incentive Slayer on top of it. And then Whisper was the decentralized messaging. So Whisper kind of died. It didn't really work. It turns out there's a successor to that called Waku, which status have been developing for a good amount of time. Swarm is still going. but you know has ended up being very little used um ipfs like really sort of seem to win there apart from it hasn't got the incentive layer uh which is what filecoin is trying to build on top of that but you know I think um and this one other now what's it I forget the name but but yeah I think it's it's sort of like with all of these things you could do a decentralized anything, right. That you could, that you could have your, your smart contracts executing your logic, that decentralized storage could store like your, your web content, you know, that you have a hosted front end that was all kind of within that, that kind of system, you know, like a bit torrenty kind of thing, but with incentives, um, and then that, uh, that messaging there. So, yeah. that was really exciting to me as well because it's like oh here's like a computer here's a platform and you can do all of the things that you that you could do with a with the web too but in a completely you know unstoppable way with built-in payments and you can build whatever incentive mechanism you like and text just talked about like a social operating system do you or kieran or anybody else up up here do they do they

**[47:06] SPEAKER_04:** Does anyone feel that Ethereum didn't accomplish what it set out to accomplish in light of the fact that we really just shipped the compute layer? Do we miss the mark in any way?

**[47:19] SPEAKER_03:** You know, it's a great question. I think the... I think the answer is no, just in the sense that you put something out there and you don't really know how people are going to use it. The world computer was a really compelling vision. To your point, it didn't shake out exactly that way. It doesn't feel like a complete computer. It feels like an economy and is only doing certain parts of the economy. But I think that's totally okay. Just getting anything that changes how the world functions done is so important. And honestly, one probably needs to specialize in general from there. And probably what you see after Ethereum is yet more specialization. You know, our projects are way more narrowly tailored on average than Ethereum as a whole. So maybe it's just it was like too much to chew and like a little bit impossible, you know, in a way. And there's, you know, I mean, actually, I just don't hear that much about IPFS lately. Like, it doesn't feel like... the demand for sensor-proof everything on the internet is that strong right now? If something would have to happen for there to be really big uptake in need again. People have, to your point, kind of forgotten that part. And it may happen again. I mean, we see pretty strong speech controls coming out of the EU, especially as regards the internet. So we might see another wave, but even the attempts at sort of like crypto-native social have all been about... financialization versus uncensorability, the ones that have caught on to some degree. And financialization is also just really important, you know. But yeah, so maybe it's, you know, it's not the complete original vision, but it's not his fault. It's sort of like where the demand went, in my opinion.

**[49:37] SPEAKER_04:** What? what about do you either you guys this wasn't a part of my original question but i'm looking at the photos here and uh i don't know in in one case i kind of feel like the area that ethereum failed a little bit was the whole dowification of various aspects um Ethereum itself never really became a DAO. We tried the DAO and that had famously a bug that we had to have like a white hat hacker group help recover funds from. And then a lot of DAOs get set up today, which are essentially just money funnels. I don't know, maybe it was too out there of an idea, maybe not concrete enough for anything to be considered and reconciled as a DAO, but The whole turning things into a DAO just never seemed to transpire, even though it was technically possible with just a compute layer.

**[50:31] SPEAKER_03:** You know, and I'll throw it over to Bob in a second, but I think... It didn't happen. I agree. And I know both of you were kind of heavily involved with the foundation, which could have pushed that along harder or been sort of a legal brick and mortar host for the DAO as opposed to whatever it is and was. And we've seen a couple kind of work. It seems like the the DeFi DAOs are OK and they may be a little bit centralized in decision making and so on, but they actually seem to serve a purpose. And sometimes they're kind of like intimately involved in the protocols, like the Aave DAO or the Uniswap DAO, etc. So like people have been able to achieve it on Ethereum. Right. And so like, why didn't Ethereum itself achieve it? Also, I mean, there's things that could be done that aren't like we could take stake weighted votes on things, for instance. And I think it's never really been done other than stake staking itself. i don't know why like i think maybe later entrance sort of had to do it from a transparency perspective um but you know the the will i think it's a will thing more than anything you know everyone one it's like a really intense um effort just to keep the network up and so on and then it got really big and you didn't want to change it um kind of etc etc so Yeah, I agree it didn't happen, and I think it could have happened, and I don't know. You know, there's definitely a gap there, and I don't really know the why. I want to also put in beforehand to Bob, we should, before we let Taylor go, talk a little bit about the Red Wedding, but I'll throw it to Bob on this question.

**[52:34] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, for sure. So, I mean, just on the, you know, on that work three vision, you know, that the other leg's not landing, think the one that has been like a painful failing is to do with work front ends you know that many many applications though they may have you know smart contract back ends even without admin keys you know just code is law smart contracts they're often still going through a conventional work from a junction point, a failure point. Often legally, like that's happened a lot on privacy or mixing things is people get like done for hosting the front end, even if the smart contracts are immutable and out there. So that's been one problem area. I think part of that though is nobody wants to run servers like i think this was something that i had a quite different thought on at the beginning is like yeah you know everyone we can run decentralized everything right and it's all unstoppable and perfect but the fact is nobody wants to run servers like for anything like let alone like something that's really heavyweight um and i think that was kind of you know the vision you know say you have missed right you can run run a browser and it's going to have pull the things from Swarm and perfectly decentralized. But, you know, that stuff just, I think, was quite naive because the cost and overhead of running a node is really quite high, let alone if you want to get the throughput that you'd need for sort of worldwide trade. So, yeah. we've ended up with a lot less throughput and a lot less people running their own stuff. And then that's got all the complexities of L2. So, yeah. I think that's, I don't know how you solve that.

**[54:33] SPEAKER_04:** I hold Apple partially responsible for making such good laptops that everybody started switching over to laptops. I think way back then, a lot more people had desktops. So the idea of having idle storage and compute just sitting there was a greater thing. But now that a lot of people, myself included, don't even really bust out the laptop, I live on my phone, work on my phone, and there's no good way to support the network as a server client on the phone. So to some degree, it feels like the mobilification of all of our devices is to blame for some of those original issues. not panning out as we had hoped.

**[55:11] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, no, I'd agree. And I mean, I spent, the first thing I was doing on Ethereum was doing ARM Linux cross builds to get a client running on smartphones, smartwatch, Raspberry Pi and all of that. And I had the real naive view at that point. It's like, all right, yeah, just get it working. And, you know, there'll be some like client thing and, you know, you can just do everything right. And this will just be like a background task or, hey, you know, we're defining this protocol and like Ethereum will just be a protocol that will just be in operating systems. It will just be part of the Linux, you know, part of the Linux distro. You know, you're just right here. You've got Ethereum running in the background and, you know, off you go.

**[55:51] SPEAKER_04:** And that absolutely never really took off in the way that it was originally envisioned, I don't think.

**[55:59] SPEAKER_02:** No, no. And then on that DAO, the DAO question, I think maybe it's as simple as that, um, people don't care about lots of things, right? It's kind of like having a job, having to participate in a doubt. We have to try and understand what's going on. And like, you know, I don't, you know, I think that's a human scaling thing, right? It was a sort of a, we don't like hierarchy kind of naivety. You know, like hierarchies are a scaling mechanism. You know, they help us solve large scale problems by breaking things up. I think having hierarchies that you can never change and be powerless within is a terrible thing, but hierarchies per se, I think are very useful.

**[56:51] SPEAKER_03:** DAO is sort of like a condo association, right?

**[56:56] SPEAKER_02:** Very much so. Who wants to be involved in that?

**[57:01] SPEAKER_03:** Only one tyrant.

**[57:04] SPEAKER_02:** That's right. So, so yeah, talking about the red wedding or, or really just really the, you know, the birth of the Ethereum foundation, right. Because you were a, uh, you were a director on that at the start of the Ethereum foundation. So how, how did all that like resolve into, into what came out of that in the form of the. Yeah.

**[57:30] SPEAKER_04:** So I was, I had the dates, uh, clicked away on my timeline, but, um, The best way that I remember the story was there was unease cropping up with Charles, who seemed to have kind of lost the trust of the people that he claimed to want to be leading, and Amir Chetrit, who Um, a lot of people, myself were included, were kind of asking what contribution is this guy giving other than, uh, just being given a title of founder. Cause he was supposed to be responsible for all the stuff that I was actually doing. And he wasn't really involved, uh, like wasn't somebody I reported up to in any way. Um, and I think those kind of those conversations came to a head when he was wearing. swag of a different organization in toronto when we had that bitcoin expo 2014 and i ended up in the basement of uh the office there on the phone with uh like a cloudflare type company to provide ddos protection and i'm just like i don't understand why i'm on the phone holding having the big boy meeting and uh amir who's supposed to be doing this is not So I think just kind of the frustrations rose and it got to a point where some hard decisions had to be made because the organization definitely was not moving forward. Harold, I think on his part was a little bit more on the, let's set this up like Google and make it a corporation. And I was definitely more on the side of open source and making it available to everybody. So I don't know what kind of like weight that had in Vitalik's head when he was making his decisions, but it felt like to me in hindsight, it felt like a huge exhale after that whole incident happened. I feel like looking at the photos, you see pictures of like how much money we think we're gonna get, what we think we're gonna do with those funds. We started imagining up these DAO sort of ideas. Really started moving forward on a lot of things where it felt like we were kind of locked within the grasp of each other, trying to like fight it out, duke it out on who was going to win politically inside the org. I remember the day being very, very uncomfortable. Everybody had come to Zoog. There were girlfriends and partners there in addition to just like the people involved with Ethereum. And it was just very uncomfortable for a very long time. It was an emotionally exhausting day. And I think I have a picture of being on the back patio where we kind of all crammed in while Vitalik was just like on the front patio walking around trying to make his decision. And it was entirely up to him at that point. So who knows what would have happened if he had made the decision any other way. I like to think that And by choosing to put Stefan and myself in place in leadership positions and asking Amir and Charles to move on to other things, I feel like we had the team in place to actually get Ethereum delivered. And maybe it would have gotten delivered anyway, but I don't know. I feel like making the change when that happened is what ultimately enabled us to ship Ethereum in a relatively on-time way and doing what we all promised it would do.

**[1:01:24] SPEAKER_02:** So just to ask a little beyond that, so when that decision had been made, so the Ethereum Foundation was that illegal entity set up in Switzerland and you were one of three directors, is that right?

**[1:01:39] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, at first it was just Vitalik, Mihai and myself were the three people. Part of that was because we were the only three people physically present in Switzerland at the time. Everybody else was remoted in. And it just made things a lot more concrete to be signing a wet pen on dead tree, the people who are physically located inside the municipality. I served in that position for, I don't know, probably a few months, a handful of months before, you know, just truth be told, no shade at Gavin. We buried the hatchet as far as I'm aware, but, you know, Gavin was pushing very, very hard to not have Mihai and myself be involved on the board and that he eventually won that battle of attrition. We ended up signing some docs on a train one time to resign our positions from the board. And to the best of my knowledge, the board's never been faithfully repopulated. There's been a couple of times where some other people have been brought onto the board, but I don't think the board's ever really been truly flushed out in that way. Maybe that doesn't matter now. But the three of us were the first ones that actually created the entity. And that served as kind of the goalpost that we were aiming for and the legal restrictions we were going to abide by. uh, Switzerland was treating us really, really well up until that point. And they had offered us some very favorable, um, incentives to continue our progress there. And I think that's worked out well for them. They, they become like a crypto Valley in a way, um, uh, cottage industries popped up around it. So I think, you know, it all worked out in the end.

**[1:03:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So, um,

**[1:03:32] SPEAKER_04:** so yeah and uh so you not to go on too much longer but then the next phase was the phase of Ming so Ming arrived in 2015 right she um she cleared out some of the cruft which I think was very necessary a lot of people still had eyes organization but weren't as actively involved um To a degree myself included with that I my role kept changing with the org first it was scaling the initial website, then it was the crowdsale, then I started helping. On doing. Not QA work, but unit testing work on the Go Ethereum clients. So doing some coding there, writing the first complete RPC implementation was my responsibility. So some of the terrible namings of the functions, you can definitely blame me for those. And then eventually kind of like traveling around the world and speaking in places that Vitalik was too busy for or didn't desire to go to, I would kind of go do those talks. So my role had kept shifting and I wasn't the only one that maybe some of the positions that were valuable in the earliest of days were no longer as valuable. And she kind of had to come and clean house a little bit. And, uh, you know, to her credit, she, she did what she needed to do at that time.

**[1:05:07] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, there was, there was a lot of spending, wasn't there?

**[1:05:09] SPEAKER_02:** It was, um, I mean, I, I ended up joining the F in. January, February, 2016, uh, which was maybe about seven months after she'd joined, um, really as a consequence of, of the C++ team being cut. Um, you know, and then, because I, I think at that point it was like, there's only like four months of runway left at one point there with the spending rate that was, um, and F price had not even really taken off since the, since the crown sale. So it was, Uh, you know, that was actually when whisper and swarm both got their budgets cut entirely at that point. Um, along with the C plus plus team getting rid of the space ship and, uh, various other bits and pieces. Um, so yeah, maybe you just want one last piece then is, is later there in 2015, you had, you had DEVCON one, which was the very first, uh, you know, public. conference there in London, which nearly didn't happen because of that running out of money. And my understanding is really that Joe and Andrew at Consensys really funded that. So what are your memories of that first conference? How was it to have a big public conference and people interested and some big companies represented as well?

**[1:06:37] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. Your recollection is the same as mine in the sense that ConsenSys definitely carried the weight of that conference in terms of financial and organizational. From my standpoint, I remember being so thrilled to have an event that was like all our own. We had been crashing, you know, quote unquote, crashing Bitcoin sort of parties, which we were feeling less and less welcome to. Bitcoin Expo 2014, it was like we had a booth there, but there was a lot of, not concern, not criticism, but like just people were not entirely sure of what we had going on. and DevCon Zero being like an in-house kind of private only event. This was the first time that it felt like showing off a little bit. We had interests from, I think Microsoft was involved as a sponsor. Fun little fact, I had come up with the colored Ethereum logo with Microsoft colors and that ended up being adopted and being used as like a defacto logo for that conference.

**[1:08:01] SPEAKER_03:** That thing was everywhere.

**[1:08:03] SPEAKER_04:** I didn't know you did that.

**[1:08:04] SPEAKER_03:** It was all over the place.

**[1:08:06] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I think I just, I had done that in like something really basic just for like a blog post or something like that. But... It was really cool to have that. And then, um, we had the big Bitcoiner guy. I can't remember his name off top of my head.

**[1:08:24] SPEAKER_01:** Um, yeah.

**[1:08:27] SPEAKER_04:** What was the last name? Nick. nick sabo sabo yes yes nick sabo yes he was there as well and i felt very excited about like feeling like we had support from both sides of uh old school bitcoiners even if he was paid to be there or whatever and also um like interest from the corporate side of like Microsoft, that felt like we had finally made it in a way of acceptance, even though the number on the coin wasn't high at the time. It was like, wow, there's literally a room full of people here. not just like techie teams but people in business development and other facets that were interested in what was going on in this community space and it felt like uh acceptance i guess is the best way that i can say i felt um it was a special time for sure so yeah i mean nick salvo famously the inventor of uh of smart contracts or the term smart contract uh

**[1:09:37] SPEAKER_02:** So, yeah.

**[1:09:41] SPEAKER_03:** I have to interject. It felt like during his presentation, he strongly implied he invented Bitcoin. Like he almost put it on the screen, you know, like 2003 is the timeframe or something. He didn't come out and say it, but it was funny.

**[1:10:04] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I, I'm trying to remember what year it was. It was, it was like, oh, 1994 is smart contracts were, was, uh, turned quite, quite a while back.

**[1:10:17] SPEAKER_01:** Um, okay.

**[1:10:22] SPEAKER_02:** I think, I think that's maybe a good point to leave it unless Kieren and Taylor would like to talk a little bit about, uh, about football.

**[1:10:33] SPEAKER_01:** I only talk about golf these days.

**[1:10:38] SPEAKER_03:** I think we can close it there and are incredibly appreciative of Taylor coming on. Actually, for the audience also, you know, on fairly short notice. So thank you and, you know, happy 10 years to Ethereum. And hopefully you'll come back. There's lots more story. But thanks, Bob, for leading us through it.

**[1:11:05] SPEAKER_01:** Okay. Thanks so much, Taylor. Thanks, everyone, for coming. Have a great week. All the best. Thank you, everybody.
