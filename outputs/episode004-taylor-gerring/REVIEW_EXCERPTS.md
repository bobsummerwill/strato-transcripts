> I hold Apple partially responsible for making such good laptops that everybody started switching over to laptops. I think way back then a lot more people had desktops so the idea of having idle storage and compute just sitting there was, was a greater thing. But now that a lot of people, myself included, don't even really bust out the laptop. I live on my phone, work on my phone and there's no good way to support the network as a server client on the phone. So to some degree it feels like the, the mobility of all of our devices is to blame for some of those original ideas not panning out as we had hoped.

> that little love. Fantastic. All here. Hello. Hello. We are back. Great. Yeah. Uh, you know, technical difficulties, uh, I suppose it's common. I think we wanted to start at five Oh five. And, uh, so we are doing well on time. Thanks for everyone for jumping over. Um, Just a friendly reminder, just throw any questions within the Twitter thread. I'll be keeping an eye on those. Hey, Mike. Thanks, Yum, for posting both two great comments in the thread. And then, yeah, like, share, repost. Got a great space ahead. And then with that, I guess we can get started, and I'll pass it over to Bob to introduce the speakers.

> Um, yeah, I was just saying on that, on that thread, on the, on the photo thread that you got tailored, there was that sort of iconic, everyone crowding around, um, Vitalik, uh, yeah, with Anthony and, uh, and Joe there, and then some photos on your, on the back patio. And then there's that group shot, uh, with everyone there and, uh, and some other bits and pieces. So, so yeah, it's saying February the 9th was a day that we arrived in

**Intermediate:**

> it felt like uh having Vitalik doing coding in Switzerland gave us a better balance because when Vitalik visited Berlin or uh Amsterdam it just it felt like the code went in the direction of wherever two of the three main developers were yeah and you know for better or worse people realize that they could, if they could bend Vitalik's ear, he had a difficult time saying no. And that means they could kind of set the agenda and direction of whatever they were trying to push, if you will. It was unfortunate that it was like, Um, way back then it was that easy to sway, but I think that's something Vitalik probably learned, uh, certainly by the time we launched the project, he was becoming more aware of how people, um, would, would use him in that way. Um, but in the end it all worked out we all had the three different clients that were interoperable to your point the amount of work that had to go into the yellow paper to take everybody's discussion and put and codify it into something that was even if imperfect uh close enough for the for the clients to be developed totally siloed from each other um i i still remark that as one of the best things that was accomplished whoever's goal that was probably gabs but Famously, I think, Bitcoin defined the implementation as the spec. And from a technical perspective, Ethereum had an actual spec and that you could derive any implementation you wanted from it. And that's something that the purest technology guy inside of me really appreciates. Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's...

**Intermediate:**

> It didn't happen. I agree. And I know both of you were kind of heavily involved with the foundation, which could have pushed that along harder or been sort of a legal brick and mortar host for the DAO as opposed to whatever it is and was. And we've seen a couple kind of work. It seems like the DeFi DAOs are okay, and they may be a little bit centralized in decision making and so on, but they actually seem to serve a purpose. And sometimes they're kind of like intimately involved in the protocols. I'm thinking like... the Aave DAO or the Uniswap DAO, etc. So like people have been able to achieve it on Ethereum. Right. And so like, why didn't Ethereum itself achieve it? Also, I mean, there's things that could be done that aren't like we could take stake weighted votes on things, for instance. And I think it's never really been done other than stake staking itself. And I don't know why. I think maybe later entrants sort of had to do it from a transparency perspective. But I think it's a will thing more than anything. One, it's like a really intense effort just to keep the network up and so on. And then it got really big and you didn't want to change it, kind of, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, I agree it didn't happen, and I think it could have happened, and I don't know. You know, there's definitely a gap there, and I don't really know the why. I want to also put in beforehand to Bob, we should, before we let Taylor go, talk a little bit about the Red Wedding, but I'll throw it to Bob on this question. Yeah, for sure. So, I mean, just on the, you know, on that Web3 vision, you know, that the other leg's not landing,

#### [33:43] SPEAKER_02 (block 47/93)

**Intermediate:**

> Because, I mean, what was happening during those months was the parallel development of three different clients, right? You've got Pyathat that Vitalik was working on. You've got Geth. that Jeff was leading, and then Gav building CPP Ethereum and speccing out the yellow paper. I mean, Jesus, Gav did so much work in those three months, like absolutely insane to get to the yellow paper so fast from there. So, yeah, I can imagine he was just heads down and did not really want to talk to people during his time up.
