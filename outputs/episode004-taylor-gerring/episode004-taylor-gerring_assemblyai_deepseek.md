**[02:14] SPEAKER_00:** That little flub.

**[02:16] SPEAKER_01:** Fantastic.

**[02:20] SPEAKER_02:** All here. Hello.

**[02:25] SPEAKER_03:** Hello.

**[02:26] SPEAKER_02:** We are back.

**[02:27] SPEAKER_00:** Great.

**[02:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, technical difficulties, I suppose it's common. I think we wanted to start at 5:05 and we are doing well on time. Thanks for everyone for jumping over. Just a friendly reminder, throw any questions within the Twitter thread. I'll be keeping an eye on those. Hey Mike, thanks Yum for posting both. Two great comments in the thread and yeah, like share repost, got a great space ahead and with that I guess we can get started and I'll pass it over to Bob to introduce the speakers.

**[03:14] SPEAKER_00:** Hi, welcome everyone. Really happy to have Taylor Gowering here as a guest. Back in late 2023, Kieran, Victor and Jim did a couple of videos on the early days of Ethereum, which I absolutely loved being an Ethereum history buff as I am, and I made a whole load of notes on those sufficient that they invited me on as a guest on the third edition. I made a bunch of notes on that again. We were talking through our own experiences from 2014 onwards to around late 2017. Just thought, especially with the 10th anniversary, it would be great to have an OG on to talk about the early days and you don't get a lot more OG than Taylor. So welcome Taylor. Hello.

**[04:26] SPEAKER_03:** Hello everybody. Thank you very much for that kind introduction, Bob. Appreciate everybody. I'm honored to join you guys and maybe add a little bit to the story, fill in some gaps in the history that people might be wondering and do whatever I can do to get some chuckles out of the audience.

**[04:47] SPEAKER_00:** Taylor, tell us something about yourself in general, like where are you from? What did your early years look like before you got involved in this nonsense?

**[05:02] SPEAKER_03:** Sure. I'm actually sitting in the town I was born in in South Florida where I was raised. Probably spent the first 20 years of my life or so a few more than that. I knew already way back when that I was super good with computers and kind of entered college university with the intention of getting a degree in that realm. That's what I did. I went to junior college first and then I finished my degree up in Orlando in Management of Information Systems. The way I describe it is half business, half computers. That turned out to be a fantastic skill set to bring to the early days of Ethereum. When it's just startup mode, things are flying left, right, up, down, forward, every single direction. And there's not a lot of people paying attention to how the business is supposed to work and be organized. I thought that gave me a little bit of a leg up going in, understanding that we're gonna have to submit receipts for things and they're gonna have to be accounted for. So I was a little more diligent with my early days activities because of that experience. I left there to go to Chicago and got a lot of great experience in the companies and organizations that I worked with up until the point where I got tired of working with proprietary software from predominantly Microsoft houses. I started shifting back towards open source software, thinking back to when I first got started. I was doing PHP, MySQL and found myself at the right place, right time to discover and learn about Bitcoin and really fall into the whole world of open source, decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain software. I feel like opportunity and luck met. I was prepared for the right thing, in the right time, right place situation and tried to stay positioned there so I could bring all my skill sets to a project that I was very passionate about.

**[07:21] SPEAKER_00:** Were you like a libertarian, a cypherpunk, a gold bug, a prepper, any of that flavor?

**[07:34] SPEAKER_03:** Honestly, I kind of had a little bit of a heads up about politics and the whole left versus right thing and trying to step away from that. But I had not really gotten into the super libertarian stuff. I wasn't really a precious metal guy. It was really once I discovered Bitcoin and really understood it and those principles that we all kind of take to heart once we finally join the cult that really stumbling upon Bitcoin is when I most embraced those kind of ideals, if you will, and certainly hold a lot of those still close to me today. Even though it feels like as a whole industry, we're kind of out of practice. A lot of people just don't really think about the decentralization side. But that is definitely part of what drew me in was the idea that it wasn't controlled and that we all are contributing. Even some more esoteric ideas like living in Holland, alternative communities and stuff. I'm fascinated by all that stuff. But I recognize there's some practical limitations with modern society on making that work.

**[08:50] SPEAKER_00:** How long were you a Bitcoiner before you heard about Ethereum?

**[08:56] SPEAKER_03:** I discovered Bitcoin I want to say in 2011. When I was clearing off a laptop I saw I had the Bitcoin software downloaded but it was still in testnet mode. I never figured out how to get it out of testnet mode until I really discovered it the second time in 2012 and going into 2013. Continued working through 2013, doing some mining, trying to join various aspects of Bitcoin projects, writing about different alternative projects like Namecoin, BitMessage and stuff. Then I guess it would have been towards the end of that year when I met Mihaly Lisier in Milan, Italy. I think that was late 2013. Then Vitalik ended up giving his talk in Miami to announce Ethereum officially in 2014. So I guess maybe it was just over a year that I was a pretty die-hard Bitcoiner and then just feeling like there's more to this whole blockchain technology and observing what everybody was trying to do with alternative things. Namecoin was one of those using blockchains for names, name resolution services. I saw the writing on the wall that there was something else to do with Bitcoin and I just didn't know what it was until I finally read Vitalik's paper three times. It clicked in my head that here's the way forward.

**[10:39] SPEAKER_00:** Were you working for some wallet company or involved with a wallet project when you were in Miami?

**[10:47] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. I wrote in on the Bitcoin dev mailing list about trying to figure out can we do a slider, just normal UI slider that we use all the time for volume and whatever to adjust the fees and stuff for Bitcoin. That was at the behest of Wendell Davis who ran a software company making Hive Bitcoin Wallet. It was supposed to be something super secure, simple enough for your parents to use. I think it had Tor network built in by default and he had taken an interest in some of the projects I was working on on top of Bitcoin. Probably most people don't know but the first project I wrote, if you go on GitHub, there's a project called Pay Through and the idea was can I pay Bitcoin to people who haven't necessarily set up a Bitcoin address yet. For example, tipping on Twitter, tipping somebody's website, things of that nature. I came up with a little system where it would generate an address to send the funds to if that person didn't have something preregistered. I had a mechanism in place where if the person then, for example, put their Bitcoin address in their Twitter link, candle profile, whatever, it could go scan that and pull that address out of there and then take the funds from the temporary address and forward them over the more permanent one. It's kind of like a way to hold the funds and then if you had an account and you're like oh, I want to collect my tips, all I got to do is put my own Bitcoin address in my on my website or on my Twitter profile and then you could receive those funds without having to really do very much. I thought it was kind of an ingenious system. Some people didn't like it because of the technicalities of how Bitcoin has addresses and return addresses are not always return addresses. But I think it was novel and interesting enough that Wendell saw the value that I could bring and my skill set to Hive Bitcoin Wallet. I started working on that kind of, on the, I guess it was like a very rudimentary DApp sort of interface. The wallet could have plug-in sort of things where you could click on the DApp sort of thing. Because you're loading it in your own wallet, it already knows what your receiving address is. So it made it easy to go to a website and interact with various services knowing already some of your crypto information. I started working on plugins and things of that nature, making them refined. But once I learned about Ethereum, I found it really hard to want to keep working on the Mac only wallet because I saw the impact of working on something that wasn't just focused on one platform.

**[14:08] SPEAKER_00:** Gotcha.

**[14:09] SPEAKER_03:** When it was very instrumental in kind of informing, encouraging me I guess is a better word to go out and travel a little bit more and just be a nomad out of my living, out of my backpack. And it was because of that I ended up going to Milan and meeting Mihai. Mihai is the one who ended up connecting me to Vitalik and the rest of the team. Wendell's definitely an instrumental part of my story with Ethereum.

**[14:37] SPEAKER_00:** Nice. He's a bit of a mystery man, isn't he?

**[14:40] SPEAKER_03:** Last I heard he was in Thailand, I think with a wife. I don't know if he was having kids or whatever, but he kind of fell off the face of the earth to me. I haven't heard from him in many, many years.

**[14:53] SPEAKER_00:** No, he was at Devcon doing a talk about grants actually, and I got my name on the screen. I didn't get to go to London, but I was on the screen as a named contributor to F Embedded. But yeah, I didn't see him around in Ethereum land much beyond that timeline.

**[15:16] SPEAKER_03:** There's a lot of that. A lot of people put in their contribution and go attend to other aspects of life.

**[15:26] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[15:26] SPEAKER_03:** Life isn't just working on startups. Some people want to have families and stuff. So there's a lot of people who have done their thing and gone off to greener pastures, whatever that means for them, and no hard feelings to any of those. I find myself in a similar space where I'm not contributing like I once was and trying to enjoy other facets of life, but I think it's just part of the natural cycle of things.

**[15:51] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, for sure. I mean, like I was saying on that Twitter thread last night, I think a crazy project I could do at some point would be trying to talk to and interview all of these early contributors, you know, 80 or 100 people, many forgotten to the mists of time. Many of those have probably never been really asked about their story or their experience.

**[16:15] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, to your point, it would be great to capture that because especially with 10 years in the past, I know not all these memories are being perfectly remembered. Our brains are kind of faulty and it'd be nice to get some of it down in video or books or whatever to capture all of that for future posterity.

**[16:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, for sure. You mentioned Miami. Bitcoin Miami was late January 2014 at very early February where Vitalik had his sort of announcing Ethereum first presentation at a conference. That was where I guess many of you got together to meet each other physically for the first time after, you know, a month or two of interactions. How was that?

**[17:10] SPEAKER_03:** A little nerve-wracking for a shy computer nerd to just meet up with a bunch of randos. I was kind of there with Wendell and his group and he had told us about these other people that rented a house. I don't think any of us had sorted rooms or figured out where we're staying and it was kind of turning into a crash space. I didn't know anybody, hardly anybody, and I was keeping to myself a lot. But it did turn out to be a very important time and place to be in the historical story of Ethereum. The vast majority of, I'd say, like some of the earliest people that had huge influences on Ethereum's eventual launch. A lot of those people got together physically for the first time there, I believe Jeff Wilkie was not able to go, but a lot of the other Europeans came over stateside for that and that was the first time that I met and sat down with Vitalik. We started working on some of the very basic ideas of what the website crowd sale sort of situation would need be. Although that all eventually changed. One thing I like to point out is that conference, there's some photos, some of which I took and some of which others took, but the way the story goes is that room was standing room only that he was in to give the announcement of Ethereum and then afterwards the questions kept coming in and kept coming in and the organizers had to ask him to step outside. I just remember these photos of him being mobbed by a group of people just wanting to ask him questions. I think Joe Lubin was standing right there probably Anthony Di Iorio was probably real close. But that's a very iconic picture in my mind at least. Anyway, the house that Anthony Di Iorio had organized became kind of the hub and central place where people gathered around. I think Jonathan Mohan was doing some recording stuff there. I remember Charles Hoskinson being there out on the back patio with Joe and Vitalik. I was in my photography era so I was doing more photo taking but I didn't know where to sleep. I had brought a hammock down with me and so I ended up sleeping in the backyard on a hammock between two trees, looking out over the canal that ran past the house for two nights.

**[19:57] SPEAKER_00:** Nice.

**[19:58] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah.

**[19:59] SPEAKER_00:** Saying with that iconic photograph, I can't remember the guy's name now, but at some point I met the guy who had the speaking slot after Vitalik and he said, and everyone just slid it off. It's like nobody left in the room for him.

**[20:15] SPEAKER_03:** That's got to be a tough act to follow.

**[20:19] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so, yeah, saying about A great number of photos from January, March through July of 2014. If you look on my Twitter thread from yesterday, I linked to some of those.

**[20:51] SPEAKER_03:** It was a really interesting time. I don't think anybody really knew what was going on. I just felt like documenting as much as I could while I was there was the way to do it because everybody was just living in the moment.

**[21:12] SPEAKER_02:** Do we. I think Bob's audio was glitching for a little bit and now he's muted again. Can everyone hear me?

**[21:20] SPEAKER_00:** I'm back. Yeah, I was just saying on that thread, on the photo thread that you got Taylor, there was that sort of iconic everyone crowding around Vitalik with Anthony and Joe there. And then some photos on you on the back patio. And then there's that group shot with everyone there and some other bits and pieces. So, yeah, it's saying February 9th was a day that we arrived in Europe. So that's where the Zug adventure began. Early February.

**[22:06] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. It would be interesting to go back and check the actual timeline. I felt like things happened kind of fast. Where we landed in Zug was, I mean, landed in Zurich, but then we took the train to a small farm town called Meierskappel, and there was a handful group there that was just staying in an Airbnb. I went along with my friend Nick Fiero, who kind of came with me. We met up in Germany somewhere and continued on to Zurich. We landed there and it was.

**[22:44] SPEAKER_00:** Just.

**[22:46] SPEAKER_03:** Very chaotic in the sense that nobody had a good sense of what was happening on what timeline, for what reason. Whether it was just sleeping quarters or getting the website online or who was arriving, it was just constant chaos. But if I remember correctly, Charles came in the next day or two, pretty soon thereafter, and then the house eventually filled up with Ian Meikle, who did all the artwork and his buddy Richard Wilde. Richard was actually the first one who was introduced to the project, and he brought Ian along and I think Ian ended up sticking around longer.

**[23:29] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Though he wasn't originally called Wilde. Funny little tidbit. That's actually his wife's surname that he took when they got married. I forget her name, though.

**[23:39] SPEAKER_03:** Really?

**[23:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yep. I guess he liked Wilde.

**[23:44] SPEAKER_02:** It sounded cool.

**[23:46] SPEAKER_03:** I just assumed it was a pseudonym or something like that.

**[23:52] SPEAKER_00:** It could have been, but, yeah, I believe she had. He had a different name before her. Jane Wilde. Perhaps it was a pseudonym for them both.

**[24:05] SPEAKER_03:** Who knows?

**[24:08] SPEAKER_00:** At that point, were other people working together in other parts of the world? Have you got people together in London or New York as well at that point?

**[24:21] SPEAKER_03:** Unbeknownst to me, I thought Zug in Switzerland was kind of ground zero. And I think from a legal standpoint, that was probably true, but certainly from a code standpoint, it was not the case.

**[24:35] SPEAKER_01:** And.

**[24:35] SPEAKER_03:** That led to some schisms down the road of.

**[24:42] SPEAKER_02:** The.

**[24:43] SPEAKER_03:** Funny thing is, Game of Thrones was premiering every Sunday while Ethereum was developing. Switzerland was just turned out to be one of the hubs, right? There was also Berlin and London and Amsterdam and Toronto, arguably. So it took a little bit of time, but it started to become apparent there was definitely a Game of Thrones being played in many different ways. I think we were all very naive in the earliest of days, but as we're trying to get money to get into a permanent house, what was called the spaceship, I started to feel some of the struggles and pains of hey, there's a bunch of other groups, and everybody's vying for resources at this time. Then you start to deal with some of the other personalities. One of the fun stories I remember is dealing with the Germans and having to accept that Germans just talk in a certain way, and it's not meant as an offense, it's just how they speak. You have to kind of just roll with that. A little more terse, but being introduced to everybody around the world and having to work with everybody.

**[26:05] SPEAKER_02:** And.

**[26:06] SPEAKER_03:** And get those different personalities to mesh culturally or otherwise. That was a very interesting process. We were pretty good, I feel like, in the local hub and everybody that you saw on the daily. But it was interesting once you started to get those other groups worked in and try to, you know, thinking about setting up a server for Gavin, we were crammed in a tiny little apartment, and he wanted something set up, and I didn't do it fast enough. I definitely heard a little bit from him, and I probably could have been faster, but I didn't realize he was kind of just waiting on the other end for me. So, yeah, it was very interesting. I was in my own little bubble with the Switzerland crew. But then, gosh, it was probably only a few weeks before we got moved up and out into a larger house and things became much more complicated much more quickly.

**[27:01] SPEAKER_00:** Just looking down through your photos, it says February 9th is when you arrived in Europe. Then February 13th is when Stefan arrived at our tiny Airbnb. Then there was something on the 22nd about moving in somewhere. Richard and Ian arrive on February 22nd and Airbnb.

**[27:38] SPEAKER_03:** So I guess that was a couple few weeks of there before Ian and Richard arrived.

**[27:43] SPEAKER_00:** Right then I'm just looking in March, the March photos. Charles bought dinner for 10 people on March 1st.

**[27:56] SPEAKER_03:** Watching Fight Club, looking back, one thing that kind of stands out to me is it was definitely a ragtag team of people there and trying to figure out what we were doing. This became a constant wedge in the group is what our contribution was from a code perspective. I was responsible for the website stuff. So to our credit, getting the team kind of motivated up and going to go from we just met and within a couple few weeks here, we started spinning up prototypes of the website and working together in our different capacities to get this machine in motion and prepared for what would eventually become the crowd sale. It's kind of no small task just having to learn how to get together and figure out your skills and know how you're going to plug into the rest of the global organization. But yeah, from February 12th, we just a few days after I landed, we kind of were up and moving on the website and that was constantly a moving target too. Once we got additional legal guidance and getting everybody's photos right in the right order and the right titles underneath and that became a huge headache. And that wasn't even the actual functioning app that took in Bitcoin and assigned your key out. This was just months before in the run up to that. So it's just everybody's personalities jiving.

**[29:36] SPEAKER_00:** I believe that at the Miami time or shortly afterwards, it was announced that the crowd sale would happen within a month or two months. It was like a really super short timeline that was thought at that point. But then all of that got delayed both with technical and more importantly legal concerns.

**[29:59] SPEAKER_03:** Getting our legal footing where we as a team felt comfortable proceeding. It wasn't just one or two guys, you have to get 8, 10, 12 leaders going in the same direction and get them to agree when they want vastly different things. Back then the whole joke was two weeks. Two weeks, two weeks, everything was two weeks away. Two weeks eventually turns into months and months because the crowd sale wasn't until what, June, July, July.

**[30:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I think July, September, it was like.

**[30:40] SPEAKER_02:** And it ran for what, 49 days or something like that. So I was in New York for the later part of this time and it was funny to have the stiff attorneys come by what was then our Times Square office, which I was there with Joe and Jonathan Mohan and Stephen Nureyev. There was always global communication going on. On one hand, everyone was massaging the stiff law firm into what the parameters needed to be and the opinion letter and so on. I think from a capability perspective, technically that was probably running faster, although we were not. I think Joe spent a ton of time on the terms of service and the docs and did a lot of the support during the crowd sale. The app was being developed. Who built the app that generated the wallets? I'm forgetting his name.

**[31:52] SPEAKER_03:** The Romanian guy.

**[31:54] SPEAKER_02:** The Romanian guy, yeah.

**[31:56] SPEAKER_03:** Marius.

**[31:59] SPEAKER_02:** Might be right. He might have gone to work at ConsenSys afterwards, but I could be misremembering.

**[32:07] SPEAKER_03:** He wrote the EthStats app, I think.

**[32:10] SPEAKER_02:** I think that's right too. Yeah, Ethne. Ah, I forgot about that.

**[32:18] SPEAKER_03:** There's a lot of old artifacts from the early days that it's like. I don't know, some of it's what were you thinking? And some of it's I missed that.

**[32:27] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[32:32] SPEAKER_02:** Quite a lot of coordination overhead and I wasn't really in the center of it, but it was very visible.

**[32:40] SPEAKER_00:** Were Vitalik, Gavin, Jeff in Zug during those months or was it just at that early bit, in February or so?

**[32:53] SPEAKER_03:** I don't remember Gavin and Jeff coming to visit Zug until after some time, primarily in the earliest days. I remember Vitalik coming there and once Zug became the legal home, we started doing more meetings in person there, board meetings, things that needed to happen face to face. I don't think either of them were super keen on it. Gav liked Berlin and Jeff had family ties to Amsterdam, so he didn't like to leave overnight if he could help it, he might come for a day trip. In the beginning days, Vitalik would come and stay for a while and that was kind of nice.

**[33:42] SPEAKER_00:** What was happening during those months was the parallel development of three different clients. Python that Vitalik was working on, Go that Jeff was leading and then Gav building C++ Ethereum and specking out the yellow paper. Gav did so much work in those three months, absolutely insane to get to the yellow paper so fast. I can imagine he was just heads down and didn't really want to talk to people during his time up.

**[34:21] SPEAKER_03:** Having Vitalik doing coding in Switzerland gave us a better balance because when Vitalik visited Berlin or Amsterdam, it felt like the code went in the direction of wherever two of the three main developers were.

**[34:38] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[34:39] SPEAKER_03:** People realized they could bend Vitalik's ear, he had a difficult time saying no. They could kind of set the agenda and direction of whatever they were trying to push. It was unfortunate that it was that easy to sway. Vitalik probably learned by the time we launched the project, he was becoming more aware of how people would use him in that way. But in the end it all worked out. We had the three different clients that were interoperable. To your point, the amount of work that went into the yellow paper to take everybody's discussion and codify it into something that was even if imperfect, close enough for the clients to be developed totally silent from each other. I still remark that as one of the best things that was accomplished, whoever's goal. That was probably Gav's. Bitcoin defined the implementation as the specific and from a technical perspective, Ethereum had an actual spec that you could derive any implementation you wanted from it. The purest technology guy inside of me really appreciates that.

**[36:09] SPEAKER_00:** It was pretty magnificent, to be honest. It was a direct reaction to what happened in Bitcoin where Satoshi had an immaculate birth and you could never really get to alternative implementations. Having the discipline of defining the spec and having multiple implementations lets you triangulate between the different clients and say oh, is there an ambiguity in the spec? Is there a bug in the spec or a bug in a client? Having that kind of balance. For the Haskell client, for Strato itself, really benefited from that.

**[37:30] SPEAKER_02:** Yes, one of the great things about Ethereum was that it was always a really big tent, very open in a way, too open to Taylor's point. But the attitude was right. Later projects have been run much more like companies but Ethereum, especially early on, felt like an amorphous open source builder collective. The spec was documented. I met our CTO, Jim, September 2014 and started implementing the Haskell version of Ethereum to the point it could sync. It didn't have all of the features in it. We started coding on it January 2015 or maybe earlier. We'd find we'd wake up one morning, it was syncing the night before, pull the latest and some big module was added. DevP2P, it takes encryption now to connect and be able to sync the network. So layers of access and consultation in terms of how the protocol evolved. We ran the VM tests and the results were provided and our CTO mostly reported the percentage which passed, start at 80 or 90% and go up to 97 and then something would change, go down to 90 again and eventually made it all work in the end. It's a really hard thing to do. The aim is to have Ethereum be a protocol like HTTP and I think this was achieved. The communications between the teams were not mature, again to Taylor's point, insider, outsider feeling despite the openness of the project. All in all it's been a great run.

**[40:25] SPEAKER_03:** If there's anything to learn from being involved in Ethereum in the early days is that despite the fact we were working on this fairness protocol, it didn't take away from the fact there were real human beings with real problems writing the software. It was a really big growing up time for me emotionally to understand everybody's differing needs.

**[41:02] SPEAKER_00:** You've got to be very atypical to be involved this early on. Getting involved in this stuff is not something a normie is going to do. Hey, there's this thing, may or may not work, might be illegal, but off we go, give it a go. Intrinsically these frontier folk, prospector types, we're all a bit weird. Get a bunch of those together, you're going to get a lot of friction and misunderstanding and maybe a lot of people not great with communication or emotional skills.

**[41:52] SPEAKER_03:** From that perspective, it was probably a special time and place that enabled us to pull together as we did. If it weren't for Bitcoin meetups and people normalizing getting together with this stuff, even though you've got to have a decent case of autism to be interested in throwing your life at this, I don't know that it could be recreated getting that kind of group of people together that had the skills and were able to put together enough social skills to make it all work.

**[42:33] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, very exceptional situation and event. What do you think might come out of Ethereum? What do you think could be built? What were your thoughts on how this might pan out in an ideal sense, Ethereum generally?

**[42:59] SPEAKER_03:** Is that what you're asking, how Ethereum would pan out?

**[43:02] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, what do you think Ethereum was going to be? What did you think these efforts could lead to?

**[43:14] SPEAKER_03:** I understood in the earliest days that there were a lot of other possibilities and 10 years down the road we've explored a lot and found out some are more possible than others. I was a large proponent of what Gavin was very into, the three tent poles of decentralization: storage, messaging and compute. That's something I was very excited by. Looking back at early writings for Bitcoin magazine and online publications, I had already been investigating protocols built around Bitcoin. I was most excited by the idea of rebuilding Web3, Web2 but decentralized. Something that wasn't controlled and owned by corporations or had more anonymous abilities so we can continue to communicate online without worrying about real ID. Closer to the cypherpunk ideal of maintaining free and open access of the Internet for everybody was kind of the core tenants I felt most passionate about with respect to Ethereum. Far more than building prediction markets or Cryptokitties. Not that those things aren't interesting, but that wasn't my focus. My focus was on how do we maintain an open Internet in light of corporations and governments applying censorship and control over it.

**[45:10] SPEAKER_00:** Those three sub protocols were Ethereum: decentralized compute swarm, swarms: decentralized storage with incentives layer on top, and Whisper: decentralized messaging. Whisper kind of died, there's a successor called Waku which Status has been developing. Swarm is still going but has ended up being very little used. IPFS seemed to win, apart from it hasn't got the incentive layer, which Filecoin is trying to build on top. With all of these things you could have decentralized anything, smart contracts executing your logic, decentralized storage storing your web content, hosted front end within that kind of system, like a BitTorrent thing but with incentives and messaging layer. Really exciting because here's a computer, here's a platform, you can do all the things you could do with Web2 but in a completely unstoppable way with built-in payments, build whatever incentive mechanism you like. Text Just talked about a social operating system, societal operating system.

**[47:02] SPEAKER_03:** Does anyone feel Ethereum didn't accomplish what it set out to accomplish in light of the fact we really just shipped the compute layer? Did we miss the mark?

**[47:22] SPEAKER_02:** It's a great question. The answer is no just in the sense you put something out there and you don't know how people are going to use it. The world computer was a compelling vision and it didn't shake out exactly that way.

**[47:43] SPEAKER_03:** Right.

**[47:44] SPEAKER_02:** It doesn't feel like a complete computer, it feels like an economy and is only doing certain parts of the economy. But that's totally okay, getting anything that changes how the world functions done is so important. Probably need to specialize and what you see after Ethereum is yet more specialization, projects are way more narrowly tailored than Ethereum as a whole. Maybe it was too much to chew and impossible. I don't hear much about IPFS lately, doesn't feel like demand for censorship-proof everything on the Internet is that strong right now. Something would have to happen for big uptake in need again. People have forgotten that part and it may happen again. Strong speech controls coming out of the EU especially as regards the Internet, so might see another wave. Even attempts at crypto native social have been about financialization versus uncensorability. Financialization is also really important. So maybe not the complete original vision, but not a failure, just where the demand went.

**[49:37] SPEAKER_03:** What about the DAOification of various aspects? Ethereum itself never really became a DAO. We tried the DAO and that famously had a bug that a white hat hacker group helped recover funds from. A lot of DAOs set up today are essentially just money funnels. Maybe it was too out there of an idea, not concrete enough for anything to be considered and reconciled as a DAO. Turning things into a DAO never seemed to transpire even though it was technically possible with just a compute layer.

**[50:29] SPEAKER_02:** It didn't happen, I agree. Defi DAOs are okay, a little centralized in decision making but serve a purpose, sometimes intimately involved in protocols like the ADAO or Uniswap DAO. People have been able to achieve it on Ethereum, so why didn't Ethereum itself achieve it? Things could be done that aren't, like take stake-weighted votes on things. Never really been done other than staking itself. Maybe later entrants had to do it from transparency perspective. The will is more than anything. Everyone wanted intense effort just to keep the network up and then it got big and didn't want to change it. I agree it didn't happen and could have happened and I don't know the why. Before we let Taylor go, talk a little about the Red Wedding.

**[52:34] SPEAKER_00:** On the Web3 vision and other legs not landing, painful failing is front ends. Many applications though they may have smart contract backends, even without admin keys, coded law smart contracts, they're often still going through conventional web front end. That's a junction point, failure point often legally. That's happened on privacy or mixing, people get done for hosting the front end even if the smart contracts are immutable. Part of that is nobody wants to run servers. I had a different thought at the beginning, yeah, we can run decentralized everything, unstoppable and perfect. But nobody wants to run servers for anything, let alone something heavyweight. That was the vision say missed. You can run a browser with the node in the backend, pull things from Swarm and perfectly decentralized
